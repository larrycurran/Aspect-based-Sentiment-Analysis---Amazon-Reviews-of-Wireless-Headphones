They are noise-isolating, meaning the earbuds block out a portion of your ambient noise. Noice-cancelling would mean they capture ambient noise and play the negative, or inverse sound waves to cancel out the outside noise. They do come with several sizes of the eartips, plus three sizes of the expandable-foam eartips which are the best for isolating outside noise. All that said, the sound quality is just ok, the sound is a little muddied compared to other headphones & earbuds I've used.

UPDATE: The company itself gets 5-stars for their efforts. After finding out I had returned them, they offered to send me their XR700 model free of charge for me to evaluate. The TREBLAB customer service team is pretty outstanding, so I upgraded my review of these earbuds from 2 to 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I didn't but it expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised at the build and sound quality. The usability is also exceptional. I have a friend who recently bought a $20 pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and he said he had connection issues and asked me to try them for a day to see if I had the same issues. His seemed good enough (I think the connection issues were with his phone), but when I tried putting his in one ear and the j1's in my other ear and switched back and forth.... Holy smokes.. his sounded like tin cans compared to these babes. Also his had a seriously annoying method of pairing with the phone that wasn't clearly explained. I love how the j1's have voice feedback to tell you when they're on, dying, pairing or connected. Personally this is my second only my second pair of Bluetooths, but so far that's a feature I've only seen in high end Bluetooths like those by Bose.

Personally though I found I didn't like the things that are supposed to hook into your ear. I took mine off.

Side note, I also appreciate that the CEO of the company reaches out to request a review, I thought that's kind of interesting. However the link included I thought might be kind of sketchy, so I initially wasn't going to review. But after trying my friend's tin cans, I thought: ""hey why not, these guys did a good job.""

I still didn't use that link though, haha.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mostly listen to podcasts while commuting or running, so fidelity is not the highest priority on my list. They sound good enough for my uses. One initial complaint from their use is that, when I listen with only one earbud in, the weight of the other causes the whole affair to shift to the opposite side, threatening to pull out the earbud I am using. I feel that, if there were some method for clipping the wire to my collar, this would not be an issue.

In February of 2019, however, I have noticed the right earbud had started to crackle, and lose audio completely. By holding the wire at the proper angle, I would get audio back, but only intermittently. This could be due to normal wear and tear, or caused if I have pulled the earbuds in adjustment, weakening the connection. Either way, some sort of reinforcement might be a better design. I will look at headphone designs in the future with this in mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What’s not to love? I got these headphones to use while I’m doing yard work and running, so I wanted them to be durable and stay in place well with a long run time. When I get moving they do have a tendency to need adjustment even with proper earbud sizes which is a little annoying, but they weren’t falling out of my ears so it’s not the worst. As far as the run time goes, it’s top-end for even the best Bluetooth headphones at 9 hours. Beyond that, once you’re out of battery it only takes 1.5-2 hours to get charged to 100% again.

I was looking for a set of bluetooth buds to use at work with my computer, instead of using my workout set, and felt these would fit the bill.  Upon receipt, the buds themselves look pretty decently built, except for one of the earpieces that looked a bit deformed.  I plugged them in to USB to charge, and it took over 4 hours for these to go from red to blue.  Tried using them for music, and found that the sound was very treble heavy with very little bass/low end.  I tried using other earpieces to get a better ear fit, but that didn't change the sound quality.  I then linked them to my VoIP application for use as a headset making calls, and the microphone quality made me nearly inaudible on the other end, unless I was yelling (not quite good etiquette for use in an office.)
I was looking forward to having a pair of headphones dedicated to office use so I wouldn't have to drain my gym set, and need to charge them before working out, but I'll have to suck it up and buy a second set of my originals.

If they don't fit just right, there are other interchangeable pieces to make sure they stay put. Been dry during sweaty workouts,.

Sound quality I have been searching for a long time. Bass that can make your ear drums feel it and yet highs that cut like a razor.

That means taking the time to test the headset with different tips on them until they feel well seated and stay in. This set includes two different sets of ear tips, a nice case, and a clip to keep the cable attached to your top.

If they are deep enough in the ear canal, the bass is just right and not overpowering without applying any equalization.

I bought these primarily for listening to music, so I have not tested the microphone to make calls.

The Bluetooth range is excellent and pairing was easy with my iPhone 7 Plus.

I really enjoy the magnetic earbuds; they keep the headset from getting knotted and tangled.

This is a really nice wireless headset for the price, and I managed to get these on a sale that brought the cost down to just under 20 bucks. They look and feel like a much more expensive pair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are so many different size options to choose from in the box, you just have to play around to find the perfect fit for you, and once you do the sound is great.  Good bass and highs for this price range, some of the mids get lost but I'm okay with that because I was looking for decent bass and these deliver. Of course the bass doesn't compare to a large stereo system or even over the ear headphones, but these are far superior to other bluetooth earbuds I have tried. I  tried a few other pairs recently and was starting to think that I was going to have to jump into the higher end price range in order to get the bass I was looking for.  I also like the magnetic feature so that when I stop to talk to someone I don't have to worry about the earbuds falling off.  They stayed in ear for an intense HIIT workout and the case that it came with will travel well I think. The only potential problem I see is that the noise cancelling on these is very effective and may be too much for an outdoor run if I need to be able to hear traffic etc, but for all other activities, these are great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I knew what didn't and did want when reading and watching reviews before buying these.

Battery life. I've had these for about a week. I drive a propane truck (I'm in and out of the truck all day), so I needed good battery life (I work 8+ hrs a day) and decent noise cancelling microphone (big trucks have a tendency to be noisy to those on the other end of a call). So far battery life is right around 8hrs. And thats with high usage. The first day I did a  2hr phone call with a buddy, several phone calls from my office, all day listening to Spotify and music on my phone; I turned them on at 8am, they beeped ""battery low"" about 6p. Btw, you have approx 6 min, from the low battery prompt till it dies.

Noise cancelling mic. The secretaries at my job and my friend say the noise cancelling is pretty good, better than my blue ants.

Sound, is a tad on the bass heavy side. I have a Samsung S7 and use a media player app called Power Amp. It has a 10 band eq. So I was able to tweak the sound to my likings. My S7 also has a stock eq which allows me to tweak the sound outside of my media player app (which helps reduce the bass in voice calls if needed). So don't be alarmed, there are ways to get the sound you want, I wouldn't count being bass heavy  as a  deal breaker.

Range. This is probably the only major draw back I've found so far. Range is about 20ft CLEAR VIEW, meaning absolutely NOTHING in between the ears buds and your phone. If objects are between you and your phone, range is about 10-15ft maybe! I also noticed dependant on my body position, they may crackle as though the connection is not that good, even though my phone is in my rear pocket on the opposite side of the mic. Once I move my phone to the mic side (which is the right ear bud) the crackling stops. I have a smart watch on order so maybe that's a work around to remedy this small issue.

Fit. I have really small ears with large ear canals. They come with a wide array of replacement bud tips. These are the first buds I've used with the foam tips, I love them! The foam tips block out way more background noise vs the rubber imo. They also come with the little rubber things to help the buds stay in your ear.  As I said my ears are super small so, I'm still experimenting with those to get a good fit. (Not a negative thing just a personal issue) One small gripe I do have, which is probably just a personal another thing. The cord is rubber, meaning it grabs my skin on the back of my neck. Causing one earbud to try to pull out depending on which way I turn my head. An idea to remedy this is some type of fabric covering for the wire that lays on the back of my neck.

One thing I love, are the magnets! They keep them in place around your neck when you are not using them. I see in the reviews quite a few broken ones...so far so good for me. If things change I'll update this review.

Syncing to my phone was super easy, just follow the directions that come with them.

Water proof\sweat proof, I can't speak on that, I haven't gotten them wet.

Overall, I'm happy with them and hope they hold up quality wise. I trully believe the only draw back to these buds are they lack range.

I didnt give them 4 or 5 stars not because they aren't good. But because they are a very solid 3 star buy for the price. If they had better range, and A-1 sound (along with all the good qualities they already have) they definitely would be 4 or 5 star ear buds, but they wouldn't cost 40 bucks, they would probably cost double or triple that.

Hope this review helps, I tried to hit the key points that mattered.

Update: it's been several months since my initial purchase. Unfortunately the first pair failed about 3 months after. One of the speakers in the buds blew. I contacted Trelabs via their website and it was hassle free to get them replaced. I received my new ones promptly. Unfortunately it was about another 3 months and that pair failed also. They developed a short in the cable on the right ear bud. I would lose sound in the right ear bud depending on my head position. Again I contacted Trelabs and again hassle free customer service!!! I hope my failures don't deter you from experiencing these value priced ear buds. When working, I'm very satisfied with them. I upped my rating to 4 stars because I've had excellent customer service with Trelabs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very good sound. I always have issues with earbuds fitting in my tiny ears, and the extra hook thingy makes all the difference for me.
My only main issue I personally have with them is the controls and mike are placed a little bit too high for my taste.
I think if the controls and more importantly, the mike was a little bit lower and closer to my mouth the other end of my phone calls may be a little bit clearer for the person I am on the phone with. While at the same time, I have had several phones calls with them. with only one complaint so far of them not being able to hear me clearly. this was fixed by my re-adjusting the mikes position.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like the fact that they are water resistant and I can wear them when it rains and have no worries. The J1 can be challenging to fit because they either slip out, or you can use the foam tips and feel the sharp edges rub against your ears. It is hard to get a comfortable fit.

Nice sound - similar to the ear buds that came with my iPhone.  Noise cancelling works ok (not as good as Active Noise Cancelling on Bose or even Treblab's over-the-ear phones) & makes the office environment nice.

I like the magnetic power to keep these together around my neck when not wearing them (so they do not flop around).

I am not a huge fan of ear buds because I never feel comfortable wearing them & prefer over the ear headphones.  These, however, seemed even more uncomfortable and cumbuersome, as if bigger or a different shape than cheaper earbuds.  If you can get over that, these are a very nice pair for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Upon receiving I charged them as instructed until the red light turned blue, about an hour and 15 minutes, then powered  on and connected them to my phone as instructed with no problem.  One of my biggest concerns before purchasing was the sound quality on both ends of a phone call.
I've had had no complaints on the receiving end (multiple calls daily) by anyone that leads me to believe the call is of poor quality and they sound as good as corded ear buds on my end.  I started an audio book to play at 100% volume (not wearing) to see how long the battery would last and got 7 hours and 5 minutes before they died. My only complaint is that the instructions said if I over charge the unit, the battery life will decrease, so I took off 1 star.  I would give this 5 stars if the charging stopped on its own if I couldn't unplug them. I would highly recommend these.

Update Jan 14, 2019 after having two pair for over a year and loving them, they both had one side go out. I read there's a lifetime warranty on these so I contacted the company and they sent me 2 replacement pair. I didn't even have to ship the bad ones back they just asked me to cut the cord on them and send a picture of them destroyed.

Was looking for good sound , decent comfort and good battery life that wtould last 8 hours to get me through the working day. I own two pairs of Jabra, one of Sony, one JayBird, another pair of Treblab. I’m not going to write an endless review going into all the small details. Let’s just say that the build quality is good, the comfort is good too.
When it comes to sound, well this is it’s Achiles anklet! I’m not sure what genre of music do you have to listen to for the bass to sound good. It’s overpowering, loose and tiresome. To best describe it is to imagine trying to listen to music through a bass heavy cinema theater system! Highs are not much better either. Dull and not crisp at all. You could fiddle with all the eq presets on your player as much as you want, you will not be able to achieve a balanced sound where the bass is punching but tight, mids are natural and the highs precise and crisp.
Like I said, I do have another pair of Treblab and they sound just the same. I thought in the meantime that they have progressed and did some work in that respect but it looks like this is their signature sound and that’s about it.
I think the name Basslab would probably be better to the true nature of the product than Treblab. Would I buy it again? Not without trying that’s for sure.
Add on. Quite a bit of time has passed since writing all of the above. The earphones have connection issues by cutting in and out. Have run some trouble shooting but the result is the same. So I guess the no matter the price, they are not worth the hassle.
I’ve given up on them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Why upgrade to a five star rating? Excellent customer service in a world that rarely cares, and a replacement product that really hit the mark.
Trelab contacted me and replaced with TRELAB XR700.

These are a great value.

I have waited almost a week to post my revised review. I used them:

✓All day at work, for 3 days
✓In the garden
✓Heavy yard work in 100 degree weather
✓walked 11k trying to impress my
  Pokemon Go loving kid. Didn't impress the
  kid, but the wireless earbuds made it a
  pleasure.

30 foot range - no problem at all, I'm pretty sure I strayed further than that. This is important to me because it's still hitting 110 here and I have to leave the phone in the house or it'll overheat in a matter of minutes if I leave it in my pocket.

Great sound - I'm really pleased. My test songs were Thunderstruck by 2Cellos, followed by the AC/DC version. I got all the highs, all the lows, all the juice.

Pairing was so simple.

They fit well. I have small ear canals: the soft wire around-the-ear support is very reassuring. There are many fittings included, both firm and soft. I wear one of each so I can still hear the world around me if I choose.

Battery time was all they claimed, a full workday, recharge with their short ribbon connector was two hours or less.

I did sweat, it did not falter.

At one point, first thing in the morning, they stuttered for a few moments. I re-paired them and it stopped stuttering. It hasn't done that again.

So hey, I really put them through these places and they did not disappoint. Great value for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I received my first pair of treblabs xr100s as a gift and loved them.  Unfortunately, I lost them. I got this set as a replacement. These are a step up as far as sound, volume control, fit/ comfort, and waterproofness.  I have not tested the waterproofness of either of them. The sound is quite good and the noise cancelling is almost too good for my needs. The microphone is excellent for phone calls.
There is one thing that I would like the Treblab people to consider for the next model.  Please, do an automatic shut-off feature.  These headphones are easy to accidentally leave on or turn on when I'm putting them away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That being said, these are good and worth the money. The J1's sound profile is fairly balanced and the aptX support makes music sound crisp and high resolution for what these cost. The battery will pretty much last a whole work day of 6 to 8 hours. The design is simple and easy to clean. Fit and comfort are good, but not the greatest. The provided set of interchangeable eartips and fins definitely help, but I find noise isolation is still lacking and the J1s still might fall out during an intense running session, especially with the cord dragging and weighing down the whole unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I paid twice the price for other Bluetooth headphones for the same purpose, they died after 1.5 years, so I decided to economize. I read many reviews and decided that the ergonomics of the J1's suited me the best, and favorable buyer reviews, although mixed, had much to say for these earbuds. I have opened them, charged them, and tried them out at home, and they seem to measure up to my expectations. The audio is good enough to make me happy not to have spent 3 to 4 times as much on high-performance audio equipment. I cannot evaluate the telephone connectivity since I am retired and have rare occasion to chat, unless my spouse of 46 years has a flat tire and needs to contact me. I think TREBLAB has zeroed in with focus and dedication to consumer satisfaction on a market that seeks music and phone service at moderate cost in the sweaty exercise arena. The tech support service sounds outstanding from all reports, so I look forward to a fine experience with this product, founded admittedly on a very modest investment. I would add that if you buy them, do read the instructions provided since so many customer complaints could have been avoided by referencing the enclosed instructions and trouble-shooting tips. “Handle with care” is probably another worthwhile recommendation since $40 does not pay for bullet-proof goods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Mids/vocals are clear but lack depth and definition. Treble is average, doesn't sound tinny or piercing.

Build quality: Cable is sturdy as well as the volume rocker. The buttons don't feel like they're gonna fall off and don't wiggle much either. The headphones have some satisfying heft to them, the metal assures that they should last. The carrying case is very tough but soft to the touch, the inside is smooth and cozy.

Battery: ~6 hours of use on my first day, don't need to worry about running out of juice.

Comfort:
-UPDATE-
I believe I found the correct position in how these should be put in. I feel no discomfort and they slide in easily. Unfortunately, my right ear canal is smaller than my left, the silicone and foam small tips don't fit too well. However, this isn't the company's fault. Fit and comfort are good, you have to play around with it.
-END OF UPDATE-
 I have a small head with small ears, these are EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The metal rings that surround the wings constantly irritate my ears and they become red afterwards. After ~20 minutes it becomes painful and I have to take them off. I've tried the smallest silicone, foam and wing tips and they hardly help. I've also tried multiple positions and the one that hurts the less is where they feel as if they're about to fall off. Headphones of the that are oval or rounded are infinitely more comfortable since there are no sharp edges and everything is smoothed out.

I really wanted to love these headphones since I was content with most of its features, however, as someone who goes to the gym 6 days a week for 2 hours (lifting and light cardio), I can hardly recommend these headphones. If I'm feeling PAIN from my headphones, there's a grand flaw. I'll try these out for a week or so to see if things change (most likely to return). I will update this review if anything significant happens.
-UPDATE-
Changed my review from a 3 to a 5. Not only did I find these comfy to wear, but when I posted my review, soon after I was contacted by customer service (Lena) who made sure that my needs were met. Good fit deserves 1+ star, good customer service gets another star. If you're on the edge of buying this device, make the jump, there's no harm trying as you can receive a refund.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

None of the silicone sizes really fit very well. Sound quality is just OK. Recently I've started getting a hissing sound and can't connect to my phone. Signal strength is weak - in and out when the phone is in my back pocket, better in front pocket, fine on my desk in front of me. But if I wanted to use it right in front of me I'd just buy wired headphones. Don't waste your time with these. Had high hopes, got what I paid for I guess.

The battery life is also good, I find that they retain their charge pretty well so they don't really need charging that often. However, if you are looking for a pair of earphones for working out, then there is a small problem, which is that the connecting wire of the 2 buds tends to bang around a lot and the vibrations will drown out whatever you're listening to, although this can be fixed by attaching the wire to your collar with a clip or anything really. One last thing as well, due to the connector wire being flat and relatively short, it doesn't get tangled much/ at all so you don't have to waste your time furiously untangling them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound Quality:
Scale of 1-10: 8

Review:
Well the reviews and company don't lie about the sound quality of these. The sounds are well balanced, lows are low, mids are mids, highs are good. These do have bass, but is somewhat lacking, just a bit. Bass isn't a huge deal to me, as I'm not a bass-head, so it's not a deal breaker. The vocals are also great, clear and easy to understand. Generally I listen to rock and hard rock music, so for earphones it's a big deal for me. Depending on the song, the instrumental parts may get a bit heavy and overpower the vocals, but it's not a big deal, and is an easy fix with an equalizer.

Calling and bluetooth are also great. Easily able to hear the other person on the other line, and they can easily hear me, even in wind.

Build Quality:
Scale of 1-10: 7

Review:
Durability and build quality are good. The headphones are made of metal and plastic parts. I don't really know what else to say besides that I believe they'll last awhile if I take care of them. The end parts are a magnetic metallic composition that hold the earphones together when you place them together for safe storage / when they are around your neck.

Noise Isolation:
Scale of 1-10: 9

Review:
These really do isolate background / outside noise. I used these today in several loud instances.

1.) In gym - Blocked out all noise of others around me, blocked out the music that was playing in the gym, even with music off (in earphones) they still isolated some noise, sort of like ear plugs.

2.) On bus - Loud bus engine was not able to be heard at all, traffic was not heard, people were not heard.

3.) In heavy wind - Wind did not bypass these, they even blocked out the wind and stayed in my ears.

4.) In busy store - While in walmart, blocked out all outside noise and only heard my music.

Price to Overall Value:
Scale of 1-10: 10

Review:
For $36, you really can't get a better pair of bluetooth headphones. Treblab is all about quality over hype, they sell at realistic prices and sell you quality rather than hype and brand name. For $36 you get the headphones, a carrying case, 2 types of earphone tips (Silicone - 3 sizes: S, M, L) (Expandable Foam - 3 sizes: S, M, L), 2 sizes of Ear Fins, Charging Cable (Micro USB // Android), and a free Treblab sticker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And as far as sound signature is concerned, it is pretty good.  Everything is very clear and precise.  The bass is not overwhelmed (personally, I do not like boomy bass) and mid & high are clear.
However, the biggest issues that I got from this earbuds are ""fitting"" of the earbuds / wing tips into my ears.
Perhaps my ears are big. But even with the large ear tips, they are too small to block out the noises and the ear wing tips are also too small that they are keep coming out of my ear which bothers me a lot.

I like the design and they are light.

Pretty disappointing. It should not have broken so soon.
Edited: after posting this initial 2 star review, a representative from the company contacted me wishing to replace the defective earbuds. It was all very quick and I'm happy to say they are working wonderfully. I'm actually excited to try their wireless earbuds as well, really great products and customer service!

Edited again 10.28.18- pretty disappointed overall with these products. I received the replacement and it worked well for 2 months, then the SAME THING HAPPENED!! They don't even remotely work now.  I'm very disappointing about it.
Edited again 11/18/18.- Although I am disappointed about the fact that these broke, their customer service is pretty outstanding. They are very big on making things right with their customers, which is definitely lacking in most companies these days. They offered me a replacement, credit for a new item, or a full refund.  I took the full refund. I hope that they can figure out the issue with these earbuds, because I really do like the company.

I have bought 4 pairs of these in the last 2 years.  Every pair has been replaced under their 1 year warranty and they all failed the exact same way in the same place.  I believe I have even had to exchange at least one of  the warranty replacements they sent to me as well so that would be 9 pairs of these at least that failed in the same way.

Every failure started with the earpiece that has the controller dangling from it, cutting in and out.  And I have had a desk job this entire time so I am not out running in these or doing any activities really while wearing these  When the earpiece cuts out I push up on the wire going into the earpiece and it miraculously starts working while I am holding it. Then if I let go it constantly cuts in and out again.  Keep in mind there is no visible damage to these.  There are no cuts, or nicks in the outer wire shield. The wires are not visible. This is an internal break in the wires or something to do with the connection from the wires to the circuit board.

The last failure I had was 2 weeks ago. I received my replacement pair. I took them out of the case and charged them up. I put them back in case without using them and  a day or 2 later I took them out of the case to use them for the first time.  I sat in the airport lounge waiting for my plane, removed the earbuds, paired them to my phone and %^$$%$  if the exact same cutting in and out wasn't happening on a never before used set of earbuds.  I was so ticked off.  I ended up going through my 9 days of vacation with one working earbud and then sent them back to Amazon since I had just got them.

To Treblab's credit, their customer service is excellent and they ship me out a new set right away every time.  But this exact same failure, 100 percent of the time, is not acceptable and they are failing to address it.

************************************************************************************************************************************
Update about 9 months later,.........
I see they changed their advertised time to 6 hours instead of what used to be 9. The 6 hours is pretty much what I was getting.

The other day one of the earbuds stopped working. The other was working fine so it was easy to determine the wiring going into the one earbud was defective. Customer service was fantastic with quick response times to my email. They have a lifetime warranty. They wanted me to cut the earbud wire in half akd send them a picture to show it is no longer usable and also I don't have to ship it back to them. They have already shipped me a replacement.  This all happened within a day of notifying them.

#####################s

I can't stand the way they just hang on my neck.  Irritating as hell really.  The fit in the ear is pretty solid and I have tried all the various sizes of ear pieces and retainer pieces but it still makes my ear sore.

They advertise like 8 or 9 hours use but I get about 6 and for some reason I get it cutting out a lot with my phone only a few feet away.  Maybe it is interference I don't know but these seem to have more interference than other bluetooth devices I have used.

Once you turn them on they connect to my phone quickly.  I have made several phone calls and I can hear clearly and I asked people on the other end and they say they can hear me fine as well.

Pros..connects quick. Has a large assortment of earpieces and retaining pieces for a custom fit.  Long battery life but not the advertised life.  Sounds ok and works well for calls.

Cons. Too much interference or cutting out or whatever you call it.  Just a bad design with this hanging on  your neck.

Strong Magnetic buds that hold around your neck when not in use.
Easily pairable, and strong connection.
Pairing stays in phone memory and all I have to do is turn the buds on, and my phone automatically turns on Bluetooth and connects.
Memory foam ear buds that fit well for sound isolation.
Cons:
The wing that fits into your ear cartilage is too wide for smaller ears. I have to bend it to stay.
The same ear wing sits too far from the ear-bud; I have to painfully jab the bud into my ear canal to get the wing close enough to sit in my ear cartilage.
I did box-jumps and the weight of the buds kept pulling the buds out of my ear. Won’t stay seated.

(11/17/17 update) they sound great, but the volume buttons don’t change the volume. When I tap +, I hear a beep but no change in volume. Same with - , but no beep.

I used to have a Jaybird X3 but sound quality is definitely better. The bass is evident, mid's and high's are good enough. What lacked from my X3 was the bass. This one covered really well at that frequency. Only thing that was a little bit of a concern was the cover for the USB on the remote. Mine came and it would never shut flush. It will find it's way out to unsnug itself from the port. Also, the plastic part that is used to shorten the cord did not do its job so I just let it dangle behind my neck. No a problem but it would be nicer if they have a better piece to shorten the length. Earbuds came in 2 different types. I like using the memory foam one (sorry forgot the name) as it snugs in your ears and don't even have to use the wings to have it stay in the ear canal.

I decided to take a risk and buy these even though they are a little out of the usual price range that I shop for because of their good reviews. I'd like to go ahead and reconfirm that these reviews are accurate. These earbuds come nicely packaged, are well made, interact well with the BT on my android, and have great sound quality.

I got these for listening to music at work, and they are amazing. They block out all the outside noise (people have to wave at me before I know they're talking to me!).
The sound is perfect, especially for bass lovers. These have a great, well sculpted sound that I've never found in ear buds. I listen to a lot of trap and dubstep, and these headphones can deliver in spades.
They are heavier than most earbuds (need it to provide the sound quality I guess) so you notice them in your ears a bit more if you keep them in for long periods like I do.
I have not used them for running or working out, so I can't speak to how well they stay in during rigorous activity.
I have also not taken any calls on them, so I cannot speak to the microphone quality.

 - fit well in my ear
 - click 'on' wait a moment, and a voice in your ear says 'power on' - simple and easy to understand
 - good sound
 - good noise isolation
 - appropriate length cable
 - nice indicator of battery life in the phone's bluetooth icon
etc

on the downside, the charging is difficult because:
 - the manual says something like 'overcharging will diminish battery life', so there's no leaving it overnight to charge
 - the plug isn't exactly easy (sometimes you plug in and charging doesn't start), nor is it the same power socket as any of my other devices
 - the battery life jumps from 70% to 30% to zero in leaps

and finally, mine broke after the first full charge, turning itself off every few minutes, so I've returned it.

The hardware is good/fine, but the SOFTWARE is BROKEN.

1. Device volume is not remembered. By device volume, I mean the volume determined by pressing the vol controls on the earbuds (not your the controls on your phone etc). There's a pre-set level chosen for the buds when you turn them on, but to adjust besides this default you have to press the buttons each time you go to use the buds. That's retarded... but making it absolutely unforgivable is that the volume controls don't work unless something is currently using them. Meaning you have to turn the buds on, then start your music, THEN adjust the volume on the controller. What??

2. There aren't different volume profiles, or call volume is broken? Say you want music/media at 80%, calls at 50% Can't have that. Music/media volume does respond to the device's volume settings (phone etc), but call does not?? As another review said, the battery warning and beeps are loud. What I think s going on is there are only 2 volume categories - ""music/media"" and ""everything else."" And ""everything else"" is only controllable by the controller on the earbuds. So you can't go from music->quickly pause to make a call - unless you want to go deaf from the call -- the only way to lower this volume is to press -Vol on the controller --- and having to pause music, fumble with the buds, THEN make a call, THEN fumble again to turn the volume back up (see #1) is ridiculous.

3. The battery indicator, which I mentioned below, is useless for Android. This is because battery indication isn't a built-in feature of ANDROID (so if you have it it's because of your phone's manufacturer e.g. Samsung, LG, HTC etc). The bluetooth protocol can transmit the info, but reading it is not an official android feature - but IS iOS (iPhones). Take a look at other 'buds claiming battery indicators - they specifically state iOS indication/compatibility. The problem is on ANDROID, since the feature isn't official, accuracy of this is a gamble -
 if it works well for you, cool, but if it doesn't? It might as well not be a feature. e.g., I've run my earphones to death two times, but the battery indicator never showed ~<90% battery - meaning it's useless for me. WHY THIS SHOULD BE DIFFERENT ON iOS is because bluetooth battery indication is an official feature, I can only assume it works functionally (since it's then Apple's problem, the creators of all iOS, not just LG which makes a few phones, Samsung which makes a few, etc).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before this pair, have only had the Taotronics TTH-07u or whatever it is. Since the tao's were giving me a very slight build quality issue, these were the same price (got same deal of the day as another recent reviewer - probably would've skipped right over if it had been priced what is the norm (only $10 more, but I'll explain), and these to my knowledge are a unique/orig design unlike tao's which are just anonymously manufactured buds that are licensed out and slapped with a million different brands... I bit on these.

First, these are definitely worth the $10 more than the taos - I just would have instantly scrolled passed them if not the same price for complicated reasons. Point is, if you want a definitively better product, go with these - don't worry you're getting scammed by weird amazon pricing, you're not, these are indeed a level in every respect than the ""#1 inexpensive bt buds on amazon"" the taos.

Compared with the taos, sound quality was definitely better - clearer, separation of dif stuff, crisper. Sound gets louder too, not that I max it in use but when I first put them on I did and the difference struck me first second - so I'm just noting. Also, the sound quality doesn't get washed out or fuzzy at higher volumes - the REAL plus of higher volume output.

Build quality is superior as well. The taos are plastic or something, these are metal or something? Not at increased weight either, I can't tell a difference. The taos charging cord is ~8inch long - way too short - the ones here are ~3ft (bit too long for my personal usage, but too long >> too short as with the taos). This has voice signals vs bees on the taos, I don't see the necessity for ""power on"" etc vs beeps, to be honest. This indicates battery life, the taos DO NOT. This claims 9h battery, haven't put em to the test yet, but many others say ~6h and I'd say at least that is right from my 3h usage today - compared to the taos, which get 4-5h.

The taos come with a very small mesh bag carrying pouch, this has a very premium softshell/hard case - the tao bag is so small I never used it, this TREBLAB case has fantastic usability (currently have my old taos in it, along w/ the dif ear tips etc that came with the TREBLAB's that were already stored in the case when opening). The J1's cord is .5-1inch longer - not a big enough difference to affect things, but just saying. The strength of the magnetization on both is the same (I'd like a strong magnet, but because it's so weak it doesn't work for ME so I just didn't use em on the taos and don't use em here and no love lost).

You get 3 sets of silicone tips and fins here, same as the taos. Except the fins here seem much more sturdy; the tao's hooks did their job, but after the 4months I've had them they were having issues staying affixed to the buds (the buds, not in my ears as hooks)(this is the issue I referred to at the beginning). These also come with foam tips, an excellent extra but I'll probably never change from the defaults they came on with (I'm a 'if it aint broke, dont fix it' kind of person largely).

These also have a much smaller profile than the taos. Those stuck out a bit too much.

All in all, get these. Even for $10 more. The taos make you go ""meh, I got a good price so whatever"" - these make you happy and go ""these are awesome for the price"".

The sound is great and the battery life is fantastic.  I am a heavy business traveler and these ear buds last me an entire travel day.  I also use these when working out and they never fall out.  My one recommendation would be to include additional foam tips since after daily heavy use, thry start to fall apart.  Not Treblabs fault since I use them heavily everyday for 1 year.

Treblab has changed the ""power on"" and ""power off"" voice from when I got my X11s a year ago to a robotic British-sounding voice that I don't care for (it just sounds lower quality and staticky compared to what it used to be).

But the main problem I have with the J1s is the battery life. I powered them on this morning to listen to some music and get a better feel for the function of them after unboxing them yesterday. They immediately powered down about 1 second after a ""low battery"" voice warning (ugh, that voice). Odd. I fully charged them yesterday when I unboxed them, as they arrived with zero charge - they had to charge for a while before the charging LED even came on (this is normal for devices that have lost all charge). They had less than 30 minutes of use since being fully charged. I decided to time them with constant use, so I plugged them in again, charged them fully until the blue LED was lit, and powered them on. They immediately paired with my phone again and I launched Pandora. I sat and worked while my phone sat about 6 feet away in line-of-sight with the headphones.

They lasted 3.5 hours before powering off, this time with no low battery warning.

My TaoTronics cost less and sound great, and I can get more than twice the use out of them, so I see no reason to keep these J1s. My Treblab X11s were great for just over a year but the left bud hardly lasts an hour anymore, while the right one will go about 2 hours. I have a pair of X5s on the way but I'll be scrutinizing the battery on those because I'm just losing faith in Treblab batteries overall now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So with that being said, ​I was obviously mad and I saw these earbuds online. I looked at the comments and was shocked on how many positive reviews there were on these earbuds. I was at first skeptical because I have heard nothing about this product but eventually I caved in and bought them and boy oh boy do these earbuds sound amazing. I bought these earbuds for about $30 and compared to my jaybirds these knock them out in every aspect. The price is cheaper, better sound quality, and the bass is amazing. So the rundown is that if you're skeptical just trust me and buy it. Hope this review helps anyone who is skeptical to buy this earbud.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The magnetic catch on the back is really handy and lets you take the earbuds out and run without fear of losing them.  I was able to get these to fit comfortably in my ears using either the included silicone or the foam ear tips.  Sound isolation with the foam ear tips is *fantastic*.  Unfortunately, any movement of the cord is channeled loudly and uncomfortably into the ear canal; this is especially true if you use the foam tips, but it happens with both kinds.  I tried to use these for running and walking and either activity turns the earbuds into painful hammers on the ear drum; running was especially painful.  I tried using the included clip to limit the movement of the cable and I can’t tell if it helps at all.  They’re really nice, high quality earbuds; I wish I could recommend them, but I can’t use them for the intended activities so they’re basically useless to me.

UPDATE: the company reached out to me after my initial review and offered to exchange this set for a pair of the TREBLAB XR700 headphones. The XR700's are wonderful!

They travel well and even on the dreaded treadmill are fine. There is a bit of noise from the cable, but you can get them situated so it's not terrible.

I also didn't like the cord that wraps around to keep them secure. It was too long.

Really enjoyed it. Then, I turned off the Apple TV1, moved to bedroom where attempt to pair with Apple TV2 (gen 4) was unsuccessful. While trying a 2nd time with TV2, the device stopped speaking in English and switched languages (Chinese possibly?). Tried unsuccessfully to reset per the provided instructions with no change. Went back to family room, turned on Apple TV1, unpaired the device, turned Apple TV1 off again, moved back to the bedroom and was then able to connect to Apple TV2. However, the device now issues status in non-English voice, which is unintelligible to me. There are no answers specific to these issues in the instructions or FAQ. Contacted Treblab support via email who responded very quickly asking for Order number and merchant channel but has not yet provided an answer.

The battery lasts about 8 hours, and are very user friendly. When there was an issue with my first pair customer service was very polite and helpful. I was instructed to cut my defective pair in half and email a picture to customer service. They promptly shipped me a new working pair. The sound quality is comparable to the apple earbuds that come with the newer phones. Sound quality is definitely better than any earbud you'll find at Walmart like skull candy or sony ear buds with a mic. The mic is also of great quality, I can use it in the wind and have no interference during my call! These ear buds are a staple for my everyday life, I use them at work and at the gym. One of the great things is that they come with 3 different sizes of silicone ear cushions, and cotton ear cushions ad well as an inner ear sizer to prevent the buds from slipping out.

There’s little visual physical defects but the left earbud has faulty output; it generates no sound unless in a particular position I can’t hold it to regularly.

Based on my experience with other Bluetooth headphone companies, I can hardly blame Treblab as it seems headphones in this price range are simply not meant to last.

UPDATE 1.16.19: Treblab's customer service got in touch with me a couple months after my review with a handwritten letter. I had a pleasant exchange with them and they replaced my headphones with a free, brand new pair. They arrived about a week ago, and the new pair does seem to be made of sturdier construction. They're working great and I will update this review after a few months of regular use. I've changed my review from 3 stars to 4 stars based on their empathetic customer support.

When I first got the white Treblab headphones, they were comparable to their price & other bluetooth headphones I received in the past. Though not as sleek and the fine-tuned, they operated and produced great sound and shut off ambient noise around me. The adjustable features were appreciated and the battery lasted a full day, or close enough to.

After normal, protective use for 5 months, the sound in the right earbud (with the microphone/volume control) has begun to cut out. See photos for the wear and possible corrosive damage from the battery. These headphones have never been out in the rain unprotected and have been stored in cool dry places. Though these headphones were great for the 5 months I had them, I'd prefer them to have lasted at least twice as long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But most importantly, don't even think about buying this. It's garbage combined with horrendous customer service (actually non-existent customer service)

One, the right earpiece (on the same cable as the microphone) stopped working after two and half months. I guess it has a short or something. I don't use these for any sports activity just because I don't listen to music or take phone calls when I'm exercising so it doesn't have anything to do with an impact or sweat or anything. It's just a defective product.

Two, when I first got this, prior to the defective earpiece, I noticed that if I got more than ten or twelve feet away from my phone, the signal would just break up. But I just let that go. As I said, it cost $39.95, what do I expect? Well, I should have expected much more. But that was my mistake

And now, for the clincher, customer service. Are you kidding me? They have zero customer service. You call, a recording answer. It's the only thing that ever answers. Never, ever a human being. The recording tells you that if you leave a message that they will get back to you. It says that they will do that by the next business day. Apparently, it leaves out that it's the next MONKEY business day. Well, they must have the world's largest voice mail box or it doesn't record anything. Apparently you are just talking to yourself because I left five messages on five consecutive days and never got a call back.

The controller has a small slim profile and is not too heavy.  The controller is closely positioned to the earpiece, so it doesn't dangle too low and get caught up on your clothing.  Unfortunately, I have some clothes that have turned up collars, so the controller gets caught up anyway (I don't blame the product for this).  The sound is good for music and Podcasts.  I have an iPhone, and when I activate Siri, its voice is muffled, so that's weird.

I have to activate Siri from the phone, rather than on the controller.  I am not counting this against the device because I don’t know if it's an Apple thing or the headphones themselves.  I suspect it's an Apple thing.

So, why the single star?  It has to do with the volume control, and in particular the UP volume action.  When I quick-press the button to increase the volume, the damn device puts out a rather loud and obnoxious high-pitch tone.  It totally sucks; the tone is really loud (and really close to the threshold of being painful) and somewhat startling because it is unexpected.  Here's what happens: when I do an up-volume the first few times, it usually works OK.  If I do another up-volume, the beep happens. Further up-volume actions produce the beep tone, and it seems the volume doesn’t increase.  I haven't fully characterized the behavior because I don't care to waste my time on it; what I have experienced is unacceptable, hence the one star; and I have returned the product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yet the Bluetooth reception is just NOT GREAT.

*To be fair I have not tested this with other phones.*

When I am using these headphones I can not put my phone in my back pocket or I will get a weak signal that causes my audio to skip. Also, if I am in a crowded area that has other peoples bluetooth devices running the headphones will really lose signal and skip or just stop working. For instance when I enter Grand Central Station I just have to turn them off because any audio I'm playing becomes incomprehensible.

I still just want to add though that when I am at work or working out with few people aroung around and my phone within arms reach the sound is incredible, better than any Skullcandys I have ever owned and better then the Beats I bought. I might even put the sound just under my wired Audio Technica buds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I contacted the seller on amazon and since it was a couple of days past the 30 days and because it apparently wasn't a manufacturer defect they poorly apologized and told me to get the warranty next time.

The big difference is the construction...
These earbuds have broken fairly easy, but if you make a commitment to treat them with a reasonable level of care, they are in almost every aspect, better than then 99 dollar bose earbuds.
Theyre
1. practical. you can wear them as necklaces and dont stick out like crazy. theyre fairly slim against the chest, you wont lose them.
2. sound freaking amazing. I, an average person, dont notice any difference between the bose and these in sound quality.
3.  Battery is pretty impressive. WIth extended use (4 hours of studing and other listening along the day) every day, they last me about 3 or 4 days on one charge, and they charge fairly fast...unlike the bose earbuds, which eberytime you turn them on they have 10% less battery than last time for having used them 15 minutes.
4.  okay for workout. The right earbud tends to fall off during very dynamic exercise because of the sound controls and such, but if you change the eartips or wrap it around the ear, it works just peachy, sounds amazing and sweat doesnt harm it.

Now again, these arent very durable. I recommend you dont hang them for extended periods of time. Its okay to hang them as a necjlace cause your chest and shirt provide a bit of a lift, but hanging them in your room for a day may be stretching it. Try not to tug on the earbud, although it can take quite a beating, it has its limits, better to preserve it.

Just treat the joint between the wire and the earbud with care and youll be good","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is good for the price,  The noise cancellation works very well.  One concern I had was the buds would not stay in.  This has not been a problem.  I work out at the gym and sweat a lot, but the buds stay put.  There are a couple things I need to get used to.

The controls on the wire... My old Treblab's had the controls on the ear piece.  With the J1 I am always fumbling around trying to find the controls.
The wire for the controls tends to poke out and rub my cheek.  Kinda annoying.
The bluetooth range doesn't seem to reach at far.

For the price, the J1 is a good buy, just give it some time to figure it out and get used to them","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted to love these but comparing them to 3 other headphones I tried, all under $30 (except for this pair) these felt the most cheap in build and material. Sound was okay if you love bass. I would have still kept these, when comparing them to the other headphones but when you use the control on the earbuds to fiddle with the volume, for some reason it does not change the volume on my phone, just in the speakers of the buds.

I have used mine 4 different times over the course of 10 days for 30-60 minutes each use and they are still on their initial charge.

Usually I'm an Apple guy, but not this time.  I ordered Treblab J1 and used them for a few days and liked them so well I ordered another pair for my wife who really likes them as well. Yes, I would recommend them to friends and relatives and have. The buds fit and it comes with a variety of ear plug sizes. There is a true 9 hours of play time and a little warning voice if power is low, Sound seems a quality range to me (not returning to vinyl records so I can hear grooves and record pops),  I'm using Apple Music and satisfied with the quality of music and how it is transmitted on the J1. As a welcome intangible, I received two e-mails from Alexander Malamud owner of TREBLAB making sure I was pleased with my purchase. There is no doubt in my mind if there were any difficulties with this product and I want to emphasize I don't expect any, Alexander would trip all over himself trying to make it right. Because of the wide range of quality and price for wireless ear buds frankly with the help of reviews, hopefully like this one, I feel I was fortunate to ""luck out"" with the J1 from TREBLAB.  Thank you for all the wonderful reviews that helped guide me toward my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

(1) Sound is equally good. J1's volume can get louder than FIT
(2) Bluetooth range seems slightly better with J1
(3) When movie and audio are not in sync (because you moved a few meters away from the audio source), with FIT you could fix the lag by pressing a button once (which also tells you the battery level). J1 lacks this feature and you have to turn the device off and back on, which is a bit annoying
(4) I prefer the fit of the on-ear type FIT to the in-ear type J1, but J1's fit is by no means bad

Wish J1 included some sort of cord management clips. Also TREBLAB, please fix (3).

But with the much lower price of J1, this is not a bad purchase at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are water resistant and very light to wear. The backs being magnetic is a nice feature because you can clasp them together around your neck when they aren't in your ears. For my ears, they stay in better than most others I have tried. Very good battery life as well. I would say I get a solid 6 hours constant use out of them which is a little on the lite side for what I would like but compared to other bluetooth buds of this size you can't beat it. The sound quality is on par with the price as well. They have some noise cancelling abilities and after burnin (all speakers have a burnin time where the quality of sound stabilizes) I don't notice any distortion.

 My only complaint would be the microphone. It works fine, people can hear me clearly and I don't have to pay attention to where the mic is, however they pick up background noise. If in the house or a generally quiet place there are no issues but if you are walking in an airport or on the streets while on the phone, the mic picks up so much of the background your caller may have a problem hearing you clearly over cars or overhead speakers.

I did have an issue have 2 months of use with my first pair. The customer service from Produtech was one of the best I have ever had. Within minutes of sending an email over my buds no-longer charging I received a response with possible solutions. Once due diligence was done they promptly suggested a replacement. All products have lemons and this company stands buy the products they sell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, when I am using the volume keys on the headphones, it controls its own volume instead of the volume of my phone. This is an issue for me because when you reach max volume on the device (even though the device volume isn't maxed) it beeps REALLY loud. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? Because I would love to be able to disable this feature. Realy, though, I would rather be able to control the volume from my phone using the little remote. Also, the cord clip is useless.

They sound good and the battery lasts about a week of use.  The base is nice and the music comes in clear.  My biggest issues so far are the cable is way too long. They have the power buttons on one side and it makes it heavier so the entire cable shifts to that side.  There is a “cable shortening clip” but it doesn’t work.  Almost feels like it’s missing a piece to make it clip together and shorten the cord.  There is no noise canceling outside of what is offered from the plug style for the earplugs.  When using it for phone calls, they pick up all the background noise and end up having to disconnect and use the phone normally.  I have had a few times where they cut out but only for a split second or two and then went right back to normal.  I looked around at most of the options and took a chance on these.  I would maybe purchase again but after trying other options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Microphone is also a bit finicky if you arent in a perfectly quiet environment.

I wish there was a clip, cuz i only listen to one earphone at a time so they dangle.

The fact that it died barely outside a month after maybe 8 1 hour gym session usages makes me sad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I noticed right away that the ear hooks are place too far away from where the ear tips are and would never be close enough for me to use in order to secure the ear buds to my ear. Another issue I noticed is that the control pods are too close to the right ear bud at a little over two inches from the right ear buds. This would cause the right ear buds to be a bit heavier and could possibly cause the tips to come out more easily as even the ear buds have no way to securely hold itself on the right ear. I also feel that the material feels a bit on the cheap side when compared to earbuds of another brand in a lower price range, but that is my opinion. I do however like the sound quality, so they do live up to their claim of better sound quality. All in all, I was not too happy for this product as it did not fit what my use case and their product description well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some unfortunate design characteristics.","Been using these for a few days now. Sound is pretty good for money, but I'm no audiophile. I love the freedom of not being tethered to the phone. Battery life is excellent for the price and light weight of these buds. However, I do have some complaints. Note, I'm using these with an iPhone 6. You may have a different experience with other devices and operating systems.

1. They're pretty uncomfortable. The smallest tips are still a bit too large for my ears. I guess my canals are on the small side, but I've never had this problem with other in-ear buds. In the past I've been able to use the mediums. Say, with the Marshall ear phones I bought a few years back. It's surprising that none of the offered tips are a good fit, because the treb labs come with several of them. It's hard to believe so many other customers have such gigantic ear holes. I really don't want to go hunting for more tips to make these feel right.

2. They have a very frustrating max-volume alert. So, let's say your track is a little on the quite side and you give the volume a bump trying to get it louder, then BEEP! Your ears are blasted with a loud warning that hurts way worse than the output of the actual media. Terrible feature. How about just allowing the customer to hit the volume button until they're at the max output? It doesn't take a warning beep to inform them there's no more to be had. Just plain stupid design.

3. The center button is all but incompatible with iPhone 6 features as accessed by corded three-button earbuds. It'll start and stop tracks, but it won't activate Siri when you hold it (no big deal for me as she's practically useless anyway). If, as is customary for iOS users, you want to skip tracks by double-clicking, it calls the last incoming phone number. To skip tracks on the treb labs, you need to press and hold the volume up or down button. Unfortunately, you get the beep again. Totally unnecessary.

I seriously wanted to love these, but I probably would not have purchased these for use with my iPhone, if I had known the above. They are a reasonable price, however.

Finally, I'll say that my original review was harsher, but Treb Labs contacted me to clue me in on the volume-hold feature to skip tracks. I had not caught this on my quick skim of the user manual. So I edited my review and bumped up a star for their diligent customer relations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall this is a nice product.

Nice to touch, good looks. Control block is not small (but not bulky either) - 43mm or ~ 1.7 in in length.
It has too many tips to choose :)
Batter life is good
It has nice BT range - I am not feeling attached to the phone.

Random notes with what bothers me a bit:
1. At some moment language switched to Chinese.
2. Instruction claims that earbuds should be charged with provided wire only. This claim for me equals that it provides non-standard charging port.
3. Instruction claims that you'd better not to charge it for more than 2 hours. I don't think producer should make this a consumer problem as it is could be easily solved by hardware/software
4. When track is too quiet and you raise the volume up to maximum - it beeps. The beep is way too loud. Same beep is repeated when you press pause/resume.
5. There are issues to use these earbuds with some iOS applications: for some pause button doesn't work, for some pause button will stop current app and resume play from native apple player. It might be app issues, but I don't have them with plantronics bbfit (that is another BT pair that I can compare with). No issues with native apple apps.

Good or bad?
1. case is bigger than needed, there is space for extra pair (or two) :).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased them after my Powerbeats3 decided to breakdown. So this review is pretty much me comparing the earbuds to them. The battery life is just not as long as the Powerbeats. It was okay. The sound quality left much to be desired. Calls weren't that clear and sounded muffled. And I received many complaints from the other end about me sounding muffled or the picking up of all the other sounds around me. It was good for listening to podcasts tho. For me, the length of the cable was an issue. Maybe an inch or two longer would have made them more comfortable to drape around my neck when I was not using them. They have a feature of having a magnetic back to each of the earbuds, which can turn them into a necklace when not in use. This was cool at first, but it ultimately aided in my losing of the earbuds. My guess is that they might have gotten magnetized to the car door as I was getting in and flew off while I was driving down the interstate. :-/","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Customer Service experience was good. They were very responsive and refunded the full amount to me even though I was outside of the Amazon return window.

The listening audio is clearer, with noticeably better treble and mid-range. The bass on these headphones is good for me, but may not satisfy those looking to get a bigger thump.

I used these a lot for making phone calls and this is where they really outperform my other earbuds. I find that the outgoing audio quality is better when the cord runs in front of my neck rather than behind my neck. Both give acceptable quality, but putting the controller closer to my mouth gives a better quality. Background noise reduction is good too. Not as good as a dedicated headset like a plantronics, but good for most uses.

The one knock I have on these is that the earbud is a little larger than my other ones and the housing is made from metal. For me this makes them a little uncomfortable. Nothing major, but I do feel it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_80?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=80&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Part of my research was whether to choose an over ear design or not. For years, I've used a Koss KSC32B Fitclips while running but I don't like having a cord connected to my phone. But the Koss are very comfortable in my ear and have wonderful sound. So I picked the J1, especially after reading that the more expensive models still have average sound and many were reported as being uncomfortable.

My first impression when I received the J1 was that they seemed well-built. The red and black carrying case was nice. But when I first put them in my ears I immediately noticed the difference in comfort from my Koss. They paired easily with my Samsung Edge 7 but the bass was nowhere near that of my Koss. I could push the unit into my ear and the bass would noticeably improve but as soon as I released my finger the earbud would loosen and the bass would decrease. The overall volume level, however, was acceptable. I have tried other bluetooth earbuds, one in particular that was about $10, and it just seems to me like no bluetooth set is going to equal a corded set. So I was willing to just accept that fact in return for the convenience of running without a cord.

My first run did not go well. Within one minute, the J1 just turned off. I checked my phone and bluetooth was still on and the J1 still showed up on the list but it was no longer paired. I tried to pair it again but my phone said it was not available. I long-pressed the center button on the J1 and heard ""power on"", telling me the J1 had just turned off, even though I never heard ""power off"". The unit automatically re-paired and I continued with my run. A few minutes later, it turned off again. Same thing as before - I long pressed the J1 and again heard ""power on"" with following re-pairing. A few minutes later, it happened again. Obviously, this interrupted my run. At the end of my run, I got a phone call and easily answered it through the J1. Halfway through the call though the J1 just turned off. Unlike my run, where I carry my phone in a fanny-pak, during the phone call I carried my phone in my hand. So it could not be a weaker signal due to my phone enclosed in my fanny-pak.

Needless to say, this is very frustrating. And there doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, for example, turning off after a certain amount of time. The pamphlet that came with the J1 suggested doing a factory reset  if there is ""frequent disconnection"". While my problem is not ""frequent disconnection"" but rather ""frequent turning off"", I did a factory reset and and am going to see if the unit still turns off on its own. I'll update this review in a few days.

Update: 10-18-2018

After the factory reset, I went on another run and it seemed to be fine. Then the J1 turned off again after about 20 minutes. That's certainly better than turning off after just a minute or so, like the first time, but still unacceptable. Once again, my phone showed the J1 unavailable. Long pressing the center button I would hear ""power on"" with auto re-pairing. My next run, I went back to my Koss wired set and I so enjoyed the vibrant bass and quality of sound. It made me think again whether I was willing to accept lower quality sound just to avoid the cord. I went back to researching more wireless sets and it seems that they all have issues and bad reviews, with hardly any earning more than 50% in the five-star range. That goes for the cheap sets as well as the most expensive. I've concluded, unfortunately, that the state of the art in bluetooth earbuds is just not to the point yet where it justifies throwing my wired set away. I'm going back to my tried and true Koss wired earbuds!

The J1 is going back for a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can't hold a charge at all even when turned off. Had these for a weekend and used the cable they came with to charge as instructed. Used it for a total of 4 hours during that time and had to charge it three times. Would not buy again.

Edit:
The customer service that Treblab provided me with was impeccable. They hand wrote me a letter apologizing for the product and offering a fix. If the fix didn't work, then they were going to replace it free of charge. That blew me away, I absolutely love and appreciate those gestures. The fix didn't work and I received a replacement. Again, the sound on them are fantastic. The waterproofing is fantastic. I ran them dry and charged them for the full two hours 3 times. Each time I used them afterwards the battery was dead within 5-6 hours. These worked better than before but these are still not working as advertised. I want to like them, I really do because their sound is really good, but the batteries don't hold up. I believe this is in-part due to the fact that they do not seem to have an auto-off feature. They stay on. So if you put it down and forget about it, the next time you pick them up they are going to be dead. If there was a sensor that detected that they were put down and auto-shut off, easily would be a 5/5 product and could go up in price another $25 and I would buy them.

They get an extra two stars for customer service. I would still not recommend buying the product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Over the past 5 years of using in-ear headphones extensively, had I come across a pair to physically damage my ears. I don't see many people mentioning pain when writing a review on these, so maybe it's just me. On the other hand, I have used over a dozen pairs of in-ear headphones that I've felt little pain from (if any). It could help to throw in smaller ear tips, but I think it comes from the design of the tip of the plastic of the headphones being ridged (not the rubber ear tip, but what the ear tip goes on). Again, I seem to be one of the very few to have this problem.

However, I Want to share a non sound related experience regarding the Treblab J1 earphones.  However, instead of sweat/moisture resistant, they should probably start advertising them as waterproof. I listen to music at night before going to sleep. When ready for sleep, I turn my J1s off and put them on the night stand - I also have a glass of water on the night stand. Last night, I heard our cat poking things on the night stand. He was being really ugly, and it took a while for me to make him be quiet. So, i went back to sleep - when I woke and looked at the glass on the nightstand, there were my J1s - both earpieces - completely submerged in my water glass. The cat had decided they needed a drink, i suppose. Or perhaps he wanted to drown them.  They had been there for a couple of hours.  Needless to say, I figured they were done for, but I pulled them out dried them carefully. Turned them on and they worked like a charm - still are!! So, another kudo to the J1s - they'll stand up to a malicious cat and keep on playing!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I opened them I was impressed with the packaging, there's a case for the buds, nice box everything looking clean and professional,  many different types of earbud size and style options are sent in the box,  too many for me to count now.  The sound was fantastic for video, music and phone calls, and the latency, or lag when watching a video where the sound doesn't match up with the video, was very very good.  (I sent back 2 sets of earphones/buds already that were really bad with this, so I am hard to please and these were very good. The 2 sent back were from a different company, not Treblab)
Then all the excitement ended and I knew that I needed to keep looking.  This is the 4th or 5th pair I have tried and sent back after doing a lot of research and confirming they did what I wanted them to do, but each one had something that didn't work.
For these earbuds, the deal breaker was not being able to connect two devices at the same time. These do not.  They say they do if you read through the ad in the description, on the actual ad lower down and it says ""Supports Multi-Device Connection"".  These do not connect with two devices at the same time.  You can pair two devices with the earbuds, but you can only ""connect"" with one at a time and use that device.  So phone and laptop paired and I can use the phone, but if I want to listen to something on the laptop, I can't.  I would need to disconnect with the phone and reconnect to the laptop.  Not Multi-Device connection.
These are great, excellent earbuds and if you don't need to connect to two devices at the same time and you want quality made and sound, then these are perfect and the price is amazing.  They just don't work for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are great for a full day of making calls while working, switching to music at lunch, then going out for a hard & sweaty workout at the gym, without skipping a beat or losing connection, and without having to recharge them too, WOW!

They have a great fit, along with many optional pads & loops included. Sound is great, even while running I can still hear the the deep bass and clear mid-highs on my favorite workout songs!

I charge them once at night and I'm good to go for the next day, no worries!

I use them every day (for about a month now) and THESE are my primary, while my expensive Beats sits at home!

Buy these earbuds, don't waste time spending big money on sub-par sets. I have and all have failed me ($300+). Now I'm a fan of TREBLAB J1's.

March 1. 2019. these are dead again. Don't waste your money.  I take good care of these and the
Right side is now shutting off or cracking when it comes on.  Evidently they are not made to last more than a yr.  So if you want throw aways they have good sound.

2018. Im writing today to update my review of this product.  After my first feedback - the tech support at producttech communicated with me so that I could get a new pair of earbuds.  I simply cut the defective pair, sent them a pic of the cut pair & they reissued a new set.  The replacement were in my hands within a week.

I use these earbugs everyday.  they are around my neck for work all day and 4 days at the gym.
The sound on these are great for music during workouts..  and use with phonecalls while working.
They stay in my ears with no problem during an hour workout..

I've paid for about six pairs of Bluetooth ear buds in the last 6 weeks and I had been repeatedly disappointed in the battery life - but my search is over! I was leery about the  claims of 9-hour battery life, but I have confirmed they will stay strong for at least four hours!

After trying four previous pairs of ear buds that all ran out of juice at the two hour point, I bought these ear buds along with a  ""1Mii B03 Long Range Bluetooth 4.2 Transmitter Receiver"" which boasts a 230-foot signal and the pair works well together!  I put the 1 Mii B03 transmitter on my old, 5-tray DVD player and then paired it with these headphones.

The sound was superb out of the box and I didn't need adjust the DVD player sound settings at all. Crisp, clear, and rich in bass right out of the box. The ear buds paired easily with the 1 Mii B03 transmitter on the first try and then it was off to the concert - sort of.

The ads say the ear buds have a 9-hour battery life, so I put three video concerts in the DVD player totaling about 4.5 hours of music and the ear buds out-lasted the music videos!

Previously I had tried three different Bluetooth transmitters which warned to stay within 10 - 20 feet for a good connection. I can't say with any expertise on the question, but it is also possible that the stronger signal from  the 230-foot transmitter allowed the ear buds to work more efficiently at a lower rate of battery use, so it's possible this helped the ear buds go the distance.

All-in-all, a great set of ear buds - sound, easy of use (volume, on/off, charging), ease of pairing, and battery life! I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Upon opening the box, the earbuds come with a variety of sizes, a carrying case, charging cord, instructions, etc. The earbuds are magnetic, which is a nice touch. The cord is thin and has plenty of room. The controls are on the right-hand side and surprisingly do not feel unbalanced. That's impressive.

The earbuds came charged 90%, which I appreciate. Upon turning on, I immediately connected to my iPhone 8. Piece of cake, which I appreciate.

So far, I have listened to a number of alternative bands, rap, hip hop, rock genres. Without hesitation, these are the best purchase for sound and price. I was expecting the sound to be about 50-75% as good as what I am hearing. The sound is balanced with just a little more bass than anticipated. I'm not mad about it. I currently have the rubber earbuds on, which fit nice and snug. These earbuds are exceptionally comfortable so far and with the wing tips, they stay in place well. The sound level also goes up extremely high while the quality does not break. Another impressive quality.

I will update this review in another month and in a year. So far, it seems like these headphones are well built and I'm surprisingly impressed with the build and sound quality.

Also the volume can go really high which is an absolute plus in my books. These are my first set of wireless ear buds and was kind of skeptical on whether to get it. I was worried that I would constantly be interrupted by static and what not but these earbuds performed as well as my wired headphones (around $35) if not a lot better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First let me say that I appreciate all the feedback I got about a question I posted about this product. Both previous purchasers and the seller answered it within a few hours of posting my question so that helped push me towards trying them out.  The sound isolation is great!  Once you find the right size and style of ear tips you want to use, outside noise is very minimal.  They stay very secure in your ear and I have yet to have any discomfort wearing them.  The sound quality if very good as well.  While to me, they are not quite as loud as Beats headphones, they are still better than most others and at 1/3 the cost of BeatsX, I can't knock them for that.  With a little tweaking of the equalizer, I was able to get the type of sound I wanted and have enjoyed them.  I would recommend these to anyone that wanted to get quality wireless headphones without paying a premium price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

First set worked great for 7 months of casual use.  Then right earbud sound went out.  No problem, Treblabs warranty covered and sent a replacement set (and great customer service). Warranty replacement had right earbud sound cutting out straight out of the box.  Still waiting to hear back on what happens when warranty replacement is defective. When it worked, sound was fair for the price.  At this price point, I'm expecting better quality than fifteen dollar Walmart Bluetooth headphones, and it just doesn't seem like that standard is met.

I use them a few times per week while exercising and riding my motorcycle.  The sound quality is pretty good given the price.  They are comfortable and mostly stay in place (I tend to go upside down when working out).  I allow the battery to run out from time to time and store them in the case they came with (I take care of my stuff).  About 1 month ago, the sound started cutting out in 1 ear.  I wrote the company and have heard nothing.  I feel like they should last longer given my treatment of them.  $40/yr for earbuds is a bit much.  I hope someone will contact me and make it right as I have purchased from this company in the past with no issues.

UPDATE:  After this review, the company contacted me.  They said they had reached out before, perhaps I missed it since the email came from Yulia.  I did receive a response directing me to severe the wires and send a picture of destroyed product, which I did.  It took more than a week to receive the new pair.  They did finally arrive and work great so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Additionally, these earbuds would not automatically pair to my phone as was advertised (even with Bluetooth turned on, the earbuds turned on, and the two devices 2 inches from each other).

They replaced my broken earphones.  I’m waiting to see about their longevity before increasing their rating, but I appreciate how they’ve stood behind their products.

I've had these headphones a bit over a month.  The sound, when it worked, was what I expected.  Since the right headphone has now gone dead with no sound coming out, these headphones are now essentially useless.

Trelab contacted me to try to help with a factory reset to see if it would resolve the sound problems.

The batteries go bad pretty quick, their life getting really short after just a few uses.

Any ""noise cancellation"" comes from the design of some of the included earbuds, which are basically just earplugs you can jam in deep.  So, it's a bit of a misnomer, but at least somewhat effective.

Worst feature is that when the battery is low or you click to pair, it screams the warning messages and beeps in your ear like the crash alarm on an airplane.

At this price point, they really aren't bad, though.  Got to pay more money for better quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The audio cues built in sound like they were compressed 1000x through a jpeg encoder
They included a cord wrangler for the back, which is a nice thought but its poorly implemented
The pieces that are supposed to hold it in your ear don't really do a good job
Audio cuts out periodically if the phone is in my left pocket and control buttons are on the right
The fact that you have to pay attention to when its done charging so it doesn't overheat is dumb

Decent audio quality
The foam tips block out noise pretty well
They hold in my ears nicely due to the foam tips
Solid battery life

Average sound. Comes with multiple ear tips and wings to customize fit. I was never able to find the perfect fit where they stayed completely in my ears but, they were comfortable enough and the wings kept them from falling out. The controls are simple and easy to use. The battery lasts quite a long time....I've gotten 7+ hours of near constant play out of it. call quality is very good for earbuds. No problems on either end of the call. They are sweat proof as advertised. I've used them while working out and have had no issues from them getting wet.

I've got 2 gripes with the product:
1). the neck cord is very short. I don't know if this is standard for this type of device but, it could stand to be a couple inches longer. I have a pretty large neck (20.5"") and I'm sure the device isn't made with my size in mind but, it would be nice if one was offered that's longer than standard.
2). in the last week to 10 days, the connection to my smartphone has gotten spotty when i'm outdoors. Until recently, the buds stayed connected perfectly during while walking or working outdoors. Lately, the connect has been going in and out for no reason. If i'd written this review 2 weeks ago, i'd have given the product 4 stars. But, this issue has me wondering if the buds are going to stop working altogether.

Overall, they are worth the money as long as they continue to work. I prefer over the ear headphones to earbuds but, these are more convenient for everyday use in multiple situations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You have to be very careful handling these earbuds, because they are extremely fragile.

Update: Apparently, my review of these earbuds, was seen by the owner of the company. He sent me a nice letter apologizing for my experience, and offered me a replacement. I may have gotten a defective set, so when they do arrive, I will evaluate them to see if my issue was just an anomaly.

(which is nice too)
- Bluetooth connects fast, no problems with that so far.
- Ton of extra pieces to fit your ear and two materials for the plugs, try them out to find which ones suit you best.
- Passive noise cancellation (plugs your ear from outside sounds) is OK, you will not hear people talking to you but loud noises will still be heard. Foam plugs have better noise cancellation than the silicone ones, so use the ones you like best.
- Nice case to keep them from damage while in a bag.
- Range is around 10-15 meters (30-50 feet) with clear line of sight before you hear some interference, but is reduce if there is a brick or concrete wall/column which is to be expected and that is good enough for me.
- Battery is great, I can get 8-9 hours out of a single charge. I just use them at the gym so I charge them every 3-4 days.
- Don't use the magnetic backs much, but it is a nice feature to keep them untangled.
- Water resistant, I use the for exercising and there is no problem with sweat so far, but they are not sealed so don't go swimming with them.

Bought them on a lightning deal for $30, definitely 5-star at that price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ugh! My 3rd pair crapped out on me.  Every pair worked for 4 months then stopped taking a charge...same problem each time.  I'm moving on.

Now my second pair is no longer working.  Still within the year warranty so lets see if they replace them.

UPDATE: The quality of the product and great customer service warrants and upgraded rating.

Well, I like these earbuds but am on my second pair.  The sound quality is great but my first pair only lasted a month before it stopped taking a charge.  Since there's a 1 year warranty, Amazon and the seller were quick to provide a replacement pair.  For now, only providing 2 stars since the quality and durability of the item is still in question.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you use the ear plug earbuds that come with you will cancel out all the noise around you and you will be able to really hear all the rich tones of what ever song your playing.

Negatives - After my first use they would not recharge, I have no Idea why this happened but there was no problem nor hassle with returning them and I actually liked them so much for their quality and life of battery that I ordered another pair with the refund.

The volume tends to fluctuate, ESPECIALLY when running. Not sure if this is a bluetooth or speaker issue. The left headphone seems to be largely okay, but the right is having serious problems. The right will constantly become significantly quieter than the left, say 70% compared to 100%. This coincides with faint but noticeable clicking/popping noises from the right head phone.

They did so.
UPDATE 8/17/2018:  The company offered me 2 options:  1) replace one pair and send me a $30 gift card 2) send me a $70 gift card only redeemable at their store.  I begrudgingly accepted option 1 as it seemed to allow me to recover some of my money, but then the support rep informed me the company's ""Management Department"" decided I get option 2.  So the only option being offered is to buy more of their bad products.  None of this replaces the $80.50 I wasted on this product and this company.  I could keep going in circles, but I have had enough.  Getting more of their products will surely put me right back here.  I don't recommend anyone buy this product.

UPDATE 8/14/2018:  Downvoted to 1 star.  The replacement pair I received back in March of this year is already broken barely 5 months later.  The second pair I purchased on this order is also broken.  That's 3 pairs broken with normal use within 9 months.  I contacted the company to replace them as when I purchased them they had a lifetime warranty - note they only have a 1 year warranty now - expect to use it.  They requested sending a photo of the broken items as they did before.  They said they can only send one replacement but offered to send a gift card for the value and agreed to replace the second pair.  Unfortunately I took separate pictures of each pair.  Treblab customer support responded with a detail they weren't overly clear on before - that I must take a picture with both pairs in one photo.  While I sort of get this as they are the exact same item, but I threw them out since so I can't do that.  Dumb on my part, but I don't appreciate the suggestion i am trying to cheat them.  I have responded in kind to customer support and will update this review with the outcome.  Either way this is what you can expect if you purchase these.

UPDATE 3/31/2018:  Updated to 4 starts. Registered the devices on their site.  Sent message on their support/contact page that one pair was broken.  They sent some ""things to try"" instructions and after I reported these instructions didn't help fix the issue, the company quickly and easily sent a working replacement.  Very good customer service!

Bought 2 pairs as gifts for my kids.  They use them for running 3 times a week and they seem to like them a lot after finding the right size bud covers and making adjustments.  After 3 months one pair doesn't play sound from both buds any longer.  The other pair is fine so far.  Hopefully the advertised lifetime warranty will make it right as I question the reliability of these given the price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews"

> Taking phone calls on the go? The J1’s microphone comes with СvС 6.0 noise cancellation, so you’re heard loud and clear.

That is so untrue! It has what I call BNET, Background Noise Enhancement Technology.

It is an excellent way to cut phone calls short, when people on the other end complain about the noise around me, when in a public place, overpowering my voice. It's going back for a refund.

Pros:

Tangle-resistant noodle style cord.
Decent music play time of 4+ hours.
Pretty good sound listening to music.
Earpiece magnets make wearing the headset like a necklace easy.

Cons:

Horrible background noise in calls.
Ear tips not small comfortable for smaller ear canals.
Rubbery cord grabs onto clothing and skin, tugging on earpieces, making single-ear use particularly impractical.
No local audio passthrough feature (microphone to speaker transmission of people near you) to allow face-to-face conversations without removing the headset.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I set my earbuds in the drawer for a couple of days while I was ill and when I went to retrieve them I pulled the earbuds apart (per normal) only to find the wires fall apart with them! After attempting to contact Inna at customer service, I was informed their lifetime warranty does not cover this and accused me of breaking the product because their ""product could never have such a defect"". Had I known they were in the business of wrongfully accusing their customers and lying about lifetime warranty I would not have ordered this product for risk of receiving a defective product.

UPDATE:
Since the unfortunate event Kate from Treblab had reached out to me to ensure this is not standard procedure for customer service and had offered a replacement for the product.  For this reason I have updated to two stars and will update once the product has been received and tested.

UPDATE:
I have received the new earbuds, so far so good! The case came whole, and thus far the headphones have stayed in one piece. The nice thing about these headphones is that it does a great job cutting out external noise , the downside is the earbuds are not very comfortable.  I currently use the smallest earbud attachment, however the plastic portion just past this part is a little bigger and slightly too big for my ear to get the full effect. If you are looking for something that will reduce external noise, however, these are an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_132?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=132&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has now been 2 weeks since that with a promise that i will get a replacement being unfulfilled without any compensation. This is a problem as i exercise daily and labor for a living.

They stay in your ears pretty well, even with difficult ears like mine. The sound quality and comfort-levels are pretty good as well. The rubber ends create a really good seal in your ear canal such that I can run my lawn-mower and hear music at a reasonably low volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Many times one or both fell out during my run. The sound quality was nice. The battery was good for about 1 run.

Update: I had to buy another one because the battery would only last for about 40 minutes now after a full charge.

The sound quality was not that good and I just wasn't very impressed with them. When the company read my review they went out of their way to try understand what went wrong and a correct the problem. Turns out the original set was most likely defective.

What I was most impressed with was the company's customer service. It was one of the few times I've seen a company more interested and what I thought of their product then the profit they were going to make or lose. They replaced the headphones with another set and a sound quality was much much better. Everybody is different, they like a different fit feel sound Etc... but I am happy with this product I would definitely recommend it. More than that I would recommend this company just for the outstanding customer service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lost first pair and bought a second since I liked the noise cancellation and the sound quality was okay. When connected to computer Bluetooth, the sound quality is below decent. Used the second pair for 6 months with active gym and running use. These earbuds do not stay in your ear while running. Because of the weight of sound control connected to the right side earbud, the running motion causes them to fall out unless you lodge the earbud in your ear. After 6 months of use, the earbud began to make static noises from the sweat getting into the wiring. Overall, 2/5 stars since they really aren’t made to last if used for athletic purposes.

Unfortunately, it does not work that well for me. The  ergonomics of the earbuds are just not for people with small ears. None of the supplied earbuds worked. I have to constantly press on both earbuds to force them into my ears to  hear anything. clearly. Otherwise the sound is very faint even at max volume. Something about the design..  that  makes it not fit well in the ear. I bought probably over 30 ""in ear"" headphones over the years, and they all worked well, while they lasted. But unfortunately not this one. I even tried to to use silicone plugs  from my other headsets - that worked very well for me with these other headsets - but still, they do not sit well in the ear with this headset. Maybe the ""stem"" is too short? Or the base too big, preventing the earbuds from going deeper into the ear canal?

 Another problem for me  is that it  does not play when charging - at least I could not figure out how to make it play when charging.
 If not for these two issues, it would have been a fantastic headset. No clips, just a short wire from ear to ear. Wonderful design, but needs some  improvements as noted above.

UPDATE: The seller was very gracious and offered  fitting tips which I am going to try, and  a partial refund (if I keep the buds) or full refund if I return them.. Based on their prompt and gracious  response to my review I am upping my rating from 2  to 4 stars.

UPDATE 2: Per seller's recommendation I ordered another set of tips (small conical) and with these new tips the headset works great for me.  I am updating my rating to 5 starts now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-the warranty for a yr.
-the easy to use and connect.
-the sound is great.
-it's a great portable device for every day heavy duty use.
-the shipping, cost and color.

The Bad:
-well I got it on Jan 12th it's now April 7 so it pretty much lasted 4 months strong, because one of the hear phones stopped emitting noise, unless you wiggle with it.
-it's a very sensitive type, I mean I wont suggest using these when knowing you will sweat alot or will be in extremely hot weather and or vice versa, i live in Florida so it sucks for me, I had to watch it and do not leave it in my car.
-overall If you pick white color your going to have to be careful and clean it because mine got really dirty quick.
-now this is, I believe a person to person thing. The thing that I value the most is the fit, and I never got these to ever fit right, but like I said I always had this problem before, but it's really annoying.
-I never really measured the distance of the Bluetooth range but it's little, I would say because of walls though but outside I'm sure it would reach the proper distance.
-personally I hate the fact that these don't skip the music it only makes call.

I have a pair of wired Power Beats and these sound every bit as good as they do without the wires and hassle of the connections getting damaged.  Easy to connect, long battery life.  The ear pieces need to be selected and inserted  correctly which takes a minute but worth it.

Far better than my LG with Harmon-Kardon sound
They are not as clear as my wired RHA 750i headphones but they cost one-sixth as much and are wireless so not a valid comparison.

Highs and Mids are clear, the Bass is solid, far better than the Apple Headset and although not quite as pronounced as the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 (wired), it more than makes up for it with the Mid/High clarity that isn't there with the SC Ink'd 2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality is not great, but what should be expected with wireless buds. The problem that ruins these earbuds for me is how poorly they stay in your ears. The product comes with many different sizes of rubber and foam buds however none of these make any difference because the large plastic part just behind the bud pushes on the outside of the ear, forcing the headphone out of your ear. Luckily I do not use these as sport headphones, because on the rare chance you do get the earbuds to stay in, they will pop right back out at the slightest motion. In my opinion this seems like a very easy design fix, as it seems like this plastic bit is purely aesthetic, and if Treblab would fix this, I would definitely recommend this product for the price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They may be good headsets but the sound quality is absolutely horrible!  I use a lot of different headsets, I have several for working out as backups and backups of backups and have therefore gone through many headsets.  Though I found them comfortable to wear, they were constantly sliding because the volumes are one one side making that side heavier and therefore the wire lopsided. The good headsets have an anchor at the back to distribute the weight.

However, I would even settle for that if the sound was good but it absolutely is not.  I have JLB headsets as my main pair.  Listening to the same song on either headsets makes the song fall flat on these.  Listen to anything loudly with some treble and you'll see how they will fail.

Sent these back.  Definitely not worth nearly $50.  Also, they did not do anything for noise canceling.  I could hear everything around me at the gym.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The J1 turns on too easily. You have to hold the on/off switch for three seconds to turn on the  XR700. Also, the Custom Adjustable Earhooks work better than any I've tried. They actually adjust! Plus, the sound is great!

If you don't carry your headphones in your  pocket, the J1 is really good; good sound quality, good fit.

Great sound quality (better than the iPhone wired earbuds)","Favorite earbuds! I was skeptical, but the sound quality is outstanding! Crisp, clear, with deep, undistorted bass. They sound better than the wired earbuds that come with the iPhone. I was pleasantly surprised by the noise-cancelling quality as well. I use the memory foam tips and they block out pretty much all outside noise. I use them when I'm studying, at the gym, or going for a run. They're light enough that they stay in your ears and are comfortable too. So far, they've lasted about six hours per charge and fully charge in about half an hour. Seems too good to be true. I've had them for a couple of months now and use them every day. If the battery ever starts to degrade, I'd probably buy the same ones again.

I was like that's not bad, so I purchased them. Let me say these are some very nice earbuds. They are loud enough where they drown out any sound. Talking to someone on the phone they are clear and no one had issues hearing me talk. There are voice prompts when the power comes on, when connected, powering off and when the battery is low. They are a bit uncomfortable after a while, but I can manage (that's just me), I take them off during each break at my job. I tried the memory foam ear cushions they weren't that comfortable so I went back to the that came on them. I will try the smaller ones to see if they help. Overall, I'm satisfied with these earbuds.

For the time that they were working, they were okay.

The battery and volume control is far to the right ear side of the wire which seems to imbalance the wire behind my head and overtime it slides to my right side. Whenever I turn my head right my left earbud pulls on the tightened imbalanced wire and sometimes pulls out of my ear.

The second problem is charging the battery.  The manual says that leaving it plugged into the charger for more than two hours can damage the battery and void the warranty.  This is very annoying.  I like to charge all my electronics overnight so they are fully charged for the next day.  That is hard to do if I have to babysit this and unplug it after two hours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These also have insane battery life. I've not actually measured or kept careful records, but in my experience, I can use these to periodically listen (maybe 1-2 hours a day) and these will nearly go a week before I have to charge again. The main reason for 5 stars, however, is the customer support. I got two duds before I got a working pair, but both times the company was quick to respond and the replacement process was painless. Though I wish I got a working pair the first time, their great customer service tells me that I was probably just unlucky and that if you have a problem it will be fixed.
In the interest of transparency I will leave my original (one star) review below
______________________________________________________________________

When I first got these headphones, they sounded great and lasted for a week at a time. I loved them. Unfortunately, they began to only play music to one side at a time, and within a few weeks, the Bluetooth began disconnection after only a few minutes. Then, they stopped connection altogether.
Thankfully I had a warranty, and the replacement process was extremely easy and painless. I was so pleased that I was ready to hop on Amazon and give a 5-star review.
BUT...
The replacement I was sent was clearly used before because the left earbud was packed full of someone else's earwax. If that disgusting occurrence wasn't enough they began having the same problem of playing to only one ear within a day of me owning them.
If you get lucky and get a working pair of these, they're great, and you will have a great experience, but my experience has been miserable, so I cannot recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm so happy I went with these ""cheap"" headphones. The look and build quality easily rivals some of the much more expensive stuff on the market. Mid and high sounds are exactly what you would actually want from a pair of earbuds. The bass sounds are a little less than I would like but still not bad by any means.

Someone at Treblab definitely needs a long distance high five for these.

I contacted customer support and they gave me instructions on how to reset them to see if that would fix the problem.  I followed their instructions but it still wasn't working.  I contacted them again and was told that this must be a defective set and if I would cut the cord between the earbuds and send them a photo of the cut cord they would send a replacement.  I cut the cord, took a photo and emailed it to the them.  If I remember correctly I received an email the same day saying the replacement set was on the way.  The replacement set arrived a few days later and I have had no issues, very happy with them.

These is a very nice set of earbuds and they sound amazing, at this price point I'm surprised they sound as well as they do.

I used them about 5 to 7 days a week for primarily running. I do sweat a lot which is why I looked for earbuds that are sweat proof.  They had great sound and stayed in my ears real good. So it is sad that they are dead.

To explain what started happening, just last week the voice that comes on when you turn the earbuds on started to sound different and would not connect and were blinking red/blue almost together like. I turned them off and on several times then finely the original voice came on and the earbuds connected. They have done this a couple times and after restarting them several times I could usually get them to connect (very aggravating though). Now today when I was running they just beeped and disconnected and started blinking red/blue almost together again. So I turned them off and now they will not start back up. Very upsetting but I guess  they are not sweat proof. I will give them a 3 star for sound and fit but ultimately should be a 1 star since they only lasted less than 6 months.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I went through a handful of cheaper earbuds that did not meet my expectations.

It's hard to do noise cancelling in the earbud form for the right price. These hit the mark! I work from home and have extremely noisy neighbors above me, non stop noise and loud thuds.  Wearing these earbuds with the foam ear pieces have been a life saver.  I haven't had to crank the volume up to where I'm going deaf and I hear absolutely only what is coming through my earbuds.  The sound quality is great for the price point and the battery life lasts all day for me.  I couldn't be happier and I have my sanity back.  Highly recommend these over a cheaper pair that claim to do the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was pretty hyped about it after reading all of the 5 star reviews, but they most certainly don't apply to the set that I received.  I would say these are for walkers at best, but are not good for running.  The earbuds certainly have a strong connection to my phone, better than some others I've used and the sound quality is very good, though not good as a quality set of wired earbuds.  Being wireless, this is not expected and being able to run without the wire hooked up to my phone is great.  However, that is where the problems begin - running.

The first and foremost issue I have is with the ear hooks.  These are worthless and don't work in my ears at all.  They're way too flimsy.  The silicone ear-tips also don't stay in the ears while running.  They slip out too easily even before my ears start sweating.  Now there are a some foam ear-tips included that do stay in my ears for a good amount of time, even after the sweating begins, however, they are not sweat resistant and they do not allow any moisture to escape my ear canals, causing it to stay trapped in there.  After a week of using them, I got water (sweat) trapped in the ear, giving me an ear infection.  To be honest, none of the provided ear-tips and ear hooks are worth keeping.  Thankfully, I did have a set of wired earbuds with good solid ear hooks and ear-tips that I was able to put on this headset and I've no issues since.

Aside from the included ear-tips and hooks, which again are terrible quality if you're a runner, these stay connected to my phone very well, rarely giving me any issues.  They even connect to my Gear Sport watch very well.  My other set of wireless earbuds are not as good (connectivity-wise) and cost twice as much (Samsung Level U Pro).

I will state that when walking only, all of the ear-tips work fine without issue.  It's only when I'm running and my ears sweat (and they sweat a lot!) are they not very good.  I'd say with better quality ear hooks that aren't so flimsy and flexible, something this more solid and stays in place within the ear would make this product much better (for a runner).  I was going to give these to my wife to use since she only walks, but after using the ear hooks from my wired ear buds, these work fine for now.

After a follow up from TRELAB, they offered a discount on these earbuds since I was not 100% satisfied.  I would've have given this review an extra start for this, had this device not completely failed to work shortly after that.  If I can give separate reviews for customer service and the device in question, I would rate it as below.  But overall, I will leave this a three start review because the device is not reliable, but the customer support is top notch.

With one notable exception (SoundPEATS P9A buds not sold anymore), anything under $50.00 (ish) dollars was going to sound terrible.  I've been through around three sets of buds and just got fed up with the 20-30 dollar range buds sounding terrible or just not working all that well.

These buds have a lot going for them. They stay put with the expanding foam tips on. They have magnetic bases so they stick together and don't get tangled up in jewelry or glasses hanging in front of me. They have pretty good bass response and the battery lasts a day or two if you don't use them constantly. Apparently, the microphone for phone conversations works good but I only have anecdotal opinions from friends.

Now for the bad. Or should I say, where they have room for improvement:
1. With the exception of bass, the rest of the frequency response of these buds is kind of missing. When listening to music, they can sound like a speaker with a pillow over it. The mids and highs just aren't there. That said, I'm guessing most people won't discriminate too much when it comes to their listening. Most of the reviews talk about how the bass response is great for workouts. Maybe that's who they're aimed at. I'm a little pickier with my listening.
2. The silicone tips are plain useless. Besides the little silicone stabilizers, there isn't any way to secure the buds in your ear. Eventually, they just fall out. You'll HAVE to use the expandable foam tips so they don't move. The localized sound reduction is apparent and you really need to pay attention if you're walking around town with these things on. Probably not good for jogging but a treadmill would be fine.
3. I really like the controls on the over the ear hook ear piece (soundpeats et. al.) but couldn't find a set with that feature that sounded even remotely decent. The Treblab controls are all placed inline with the cable. You invariably end up fumbling with the cable to get to the control pod and then finding the proper button to either raise/lower the volume or pause or answer a call. It  can be maddening.
4. This only happens infrequently, but I sometimes get disconnects with my buds. They'll work fine but sometimes, they just disconnect in the middle of a phone call or when I'm listening to music. It's very rare but it's the only pair of buds where I've had this happen.

Conclusion: If you want buds that are pretty robust and pump out the bass during a workout, these guys are for you. If you have a discriminating ear and need to hear something beyond 'oontz, oontz, oontz', you probably want to keep on looking. As for me, I'm probably going to keep looking.

Update 9/17/19:
After expressing my dissatisfaction with J1's, Treblab really bent over backwards to try to get me into a set of buds I liked. Their customer service is superlative. Unfortunately, I experienced the same sound quality issues with the XR700's. Great fit and the all my original positives apply here, but just no midrange or treble. That said, the customer service from Treblab can't be understated. It's far better than their product deserves. I hope they someday come out with a pair of buds that sound as good as they are comfortable to wear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really don't like the extra ear hooks, but the great thing about these earphones is that you can remove them completely, if you prefer. Also, you get a variety of ear tips, both rubber and foam ones, which is really useful, and a carrying case that fits everything.

The design of the earphones is excellent, without blocky unsightly extra parts on the cord or the earbuds, but I was surprised how much heavier the actual buds were compared to my other earphones. I am a little bit annoyed by the blue light flashing when the earphones are on. This is especially noticeable in a low light environment. However, the female voice that does the status announcement like ""Power on"" is quite pleasant and not annoying.

The battery lasts a long time, and they sound great.

The saving grace is that it's memory foam so it can be squished and expand. The other small thing is that the amount of battery left that it reports on my phone is inaccurate, so it dies a bit unexpectedly. Luckily this is saved once again by the fact that they include a space in the carry case for the charger and it charges super quickly.

UPDATE: after having these a year I have found that wearing them for an extended time hits the antehelix because of the limited sizing. It is VERY painful and the customer service sucks. I contacted them with no satisfaction, for something with a lifetime warranty I expected something besides an offer of 15% off.

My only complaint is regarding the volume control on the earbuds: The handy volume control buttons would be amazingly convenient for when your phone is packed away in a pocket or bag and you are on-the-go exercising or working, however, I can't use the volume control buttons due to the EXTREMELY LOUD confirmation beep that it makes in your ears when you tap to increase or decrease the volume while the earbuds are in use. When my music is playing at a normal listening level, if I tap the up or down volume button one time the earbuds produce a beep SO LOUD that I jump out of my skin and impulsively yank the earbuds out of my ears and have to recover from the shock of the insanely loud sound that just projected into both eardrums. This has to be a product defect. It makes the volume control totally impossible to use and traumatizing to troubleshoot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The J1s aren’t flawless, but they’re almost definitely the best you’re going to get at this price point.

When listening to music, the sound quality is fairly good out-of-the-box, and very solid if you know how to tweak the equalizer in your music app or media player of choice.  Once you’ve done that, highs are clear and not tinny, lows are relatively free of muddiness, and mids are more than passable.  Fidelity and soundstage are always going to suffer a bit on these earbuds compared to good ol’ cans or tower speakers, but props to Treblab for managing to put up very respectable marks in both of those categories.  For the frequent-flyers and long-commuters, these guys handle podcasts, movies, TV, and audiobooks without any problem.

Hardware is another positive story overall.  On the plus side, the J1s feel premium, with metal accents and an understated design.  The enclosure for the inline mic and toggle buttons is compact and unobtrusive, and the flat cable is tough to tangle.  The mic is clear enough on phone calls, and bluetooth connectivity is stable.  Battery life is flat-out awesome.  The only problem I encountered was that the included ear fins were a bit too short and flimsy to hold these guys, and I ended up using a set of rubber fins from an old, broken pair of sport buds I had lying around.  That didn’t end being a huge deal for me and, it was made up for by the inclusion of foam tips in addition to the silicone variant.  Anyone transitioning from on-ear headphones will likely find this to be more comfortable, and in my experience the foam creates a better seal and benefits sound quality.

TLDR — Awesome value, awesome sound quality for the price-point, awesome battery life, solid build quality.  Those with large or abnormally-shaped ears may experience issues with fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They sound great and their fit is perfect. Usually after hours of using other earbuds, my ears hurt from the fin that secure them. With these I never have sore ears.

My only complaint is the distance for use. It says 30 ft. My set doesn't reach that far. When I have them in my back pocket and bend over to pick something up, it starts to cut out. The connection through walls isn't as good as other earbuds. This cuts out more than my other ones.

My only quibble is that they tend to fall out when I'm running.  I have rather small ears and even though I have replaced the rubber pieces for smaller ones that are included in the package, they still manage to fall out of my ears which tends to make me break my focus and throws my pace off.  They are useful overall though and particularly when taking long walks.

UPDATE:  I've had these for less than a month and they are no longer working.  They no longer connect to my phone and frankly are now useless.  They are still in excellent condition and weren't damaged or dropped but they are just not working any more.  Not worth the money in the end.

UPDATE:  After receiving a replacement pair from the company, I decided to give these one more try and though skeptical at first I am very pleased with them.  They have remained connected to my phone and while they do still fall out of my ears occasionally when running, it does not happen as much as before.

First, audio stopped coming out of the left ear, then it started draining the battery quickly to the point of it being unusable (battery discharges in about 30 minutes).
However, I'm buying a second one because for this price audio quality was very good, noise isolation is great, battery life was really good (used to last over 6 or 7 hours on one charge). It's very portable and easy to connect and start listening right away, never had any issues until it eventually broke (I was a very heavy user), the wire is short and the earbuds themselves are not that bulky compared to other wireless earbuds...

Battery lasts as advertised. I can get almost 9 hours out of a 2 hour charge. They last my 10 hour shift because I charge them while I am on break.

About a 30-40 foot range. I can leave my MP3 player at my workstation and walk freely around at work.

Quality construction. I use them hard both at work and at home and they look brand new. You have to play with the different size buds to get the one that fits but once you do the wing helps them stay in your ear even through the most rigorous exercise.

Sound quality. Here is where they lose a star. The quality of sound could be a little better. But downloading an equalizer app helped. They are also advertised as being noise cancelling. They are but I feel they could be better.

In an effort to find something wrong with these earbuds I think I am being a little picky with the sound quality.

I've never had difficulties connecting these, battery is still going strong, and have never had one of the retaining tabs pop off.

Sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. It is slightly muddy in the mid range but has a full sound spectrum. Also has a decent sound stage for an ear bud. Noise isolation with the foam tips is very good. The active noise canceling advertised appears to be limited to the mic, as per the Qualcomm chipset specsheet.

Sound quality is comparable to my Sony XB950N1 cans, but I don't use them for mowing (is not a riding mower, is hot and dusty). Sound definition is not as good as  my benchmark Samsung Level Pros.

Im getting from the left side a really  annoying weird tone,its like a pairing sound whistle like punching my ear,  they are frequent when using it for  phone calls at the point that I have to take that side out or even just put the call on speaker. While playing songs,  that weird  sound overpower the original melody and instead of listening to your music,  you just start counting how many times it does it.

Great value.","***Update: After 8 months, the left ear buds no longer work. Very disappointed since I only use these twice a week for a workout.. ***

Easily one of the more affordable and great value bluetooth wireless earbuds out there. The battery lasts 6 hours on average, so I'm not sure where they get the 9 hours from, maybe on very low volume it lasts that long. Trust me, it's 6 hours for normal use.

The bass is definitely lacking, there is no noise cancellation, but the sound is crystal clear, and if you use the memory foam, then you can barely here outside noise when music is on. (so maybe noise dampening)

Overall, I like the feel of the buds, the sound is decent, and the price is amazing. I got it for $19 and free shipping because of Prime membership. It was during a special pricing promo i think.

I wouldn't say there isn't a latency or delay, for most netflix and youtube, etc there isn't a noticeable delay at all. None. but with some apps, like the xfinity app, it does have latency. I'm not sure if the issue is the app or the headphones, but I tried watching Xfinity streaming app on my wired headphones, and there wasn't any latency issue. But for general video watching, so far NO Delay.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sometimes when I press on it to push it into my ear the whole thing turns off.  Probably a loose connection internally.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: So I've been through 4 from Amazon and 2 from Walmart and these are the best ones I've found for running.  They're the only ones that fit inside the ear and stay there.  I like the fact that these came with foam tips as well as the standard tips to give you more sweat resistance and noise isolation.  I would have given them 5 stars because they fit all my needs and are really great, but I chose these over a similar product because of the ""noise cancelling"" in the description.  As far as I can tell, that's just false advertising.  They do block out noise, so I think they are great at ""noise isolation"" but do not seem to support the active noise cancellation.  The deception is not worth me returning them since that was just an added bonus I was looking forward to, but it did leave me feeling a bit more skeptical of the company.  Also, watch out because the cord material is a bit cheap feeling and crimps easily, but that was expected from the price point.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought these around the same week my brother bought his to be able to listen to music while at the gym. After 6 months of daily use I found out that Treblad competes against the bose in price, functionality, and durability. My brothers “premium” $200 headphones fell apart after 4 months of everyday use and just after a 6 month period completely died. My J1’s still sound like the first day I turned them on and are still in one peice. I work in construction and habitually go to the gym so these headphones have definitly experienced drops, dirt, water, and sweat. If you are hesitant because of the too good to be true price DONT BE. I even wish I bought them sooner.

The pair I returned was average 4.5. Awful sound hurt my ears and soon I returned. I read reviews for J1 only by 7 people a couple of weeks ago. All were convincing. I took a chance and I see 30 plus people have rated 5 stars as of today. In addition to excellent sound and price, there was one pleasant surprise.

Great sound, Long Battery Life at a very good price.","Love at first sight. Why? Because of the value-for-money overall, it's the best I've ever owned. Let's try to agree for moment that for $29.00, it's a bit ambitious to expect Bang & Olufsen sound quality. Or even Bose. But here is where the Treblab J1's deliver: robust bass, satisfying mid range and highs. Plus, very good phone quality for both the user and the caller. The fit, as most of ear-buds, relies on the type of ear-tip. Treblab J1's offer a ridiculously generous array of tips in foam and rubber and the sound isolation is superb. They just fit very well for me and I really have to remove them to hear someone speak. Are these the best ear-buds I've ever owned? Absolutely not but because wired earphones and a built-in DAC to your device is always going to sound better. But, the sound quality is extremly good and then, on top of everything else, you get almost nine (9) hours of standby and 5+ hours of music or talk time. Finally, as with most earbuds, the sound breaks in after a little while. It gets richer and warmer. Outstanding value for your money and they are built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first I did have some issues finding a proper fit despite the various fins and tips since this model lacks an extended or angled bore however once you've found what works they do seem to stay in just fine with a good seal. Something I noticed was that while it does have passive noise cancelling I was not able to notice any active kind even after reading over the included paperwork. Aside from that though the sound and battery life was good at over 6-8 hours of usage. I would definitely purchase from them again but I'd like to see if they could slim down the overall profile since they do stick out a bit and possibly even out the weight by adding a 2nd battery from the left earphone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fantastic sound. Wireless is Awesome, i'm never going back!","Understand i've had them for less than a week but so far...the sound is fantastic, fit and function also fantastic, battery life is also good for an entire day of listening (8+ hours at low to mid level volume).
Bass seems to be what most want and the form factor limits what this style can produce, in my opinion the bass output is phenomenal for the size limitations inherent in earbud type headphones...more than i ever expected from them. I don't listen to bass heavy music but i never expected any earbuds to sound this great. 20% music, 80% audiobook listening, 100% phone calls, is what i use them for and i couldn't wish for any better sound quality.
Bluetooth...it works well, we're going to get different reception quality depending on many factors including location, building, and interference from other wireless signal density in the area...at home i get about 25 feet before problems occur, at work i get about 35 feet so your results may vary...like all bluetooth devices.
Style/ build quality...i chose the white and am happy i did, i have tons of black cables and headphones and these stand out among them as well as looking good...black is overdone and overrated. Build quality is good for the set i have 'so far'...it's impossible to predict long term but they seem sturdy despite some pictures of them broken, they are super light and i tend to handle them carefully, so far so good (which may change in the future as i put more mileage on them).
Fit....with all the options they include if they don't fit you then you are not human. Mine fit perfectly as shipped. They do not protrude far from the ear if at all, all ears are different but mine seem to swallow these and fit nearly flush with my outer ear. The pictures online make them seem larger than they are for a good reason, an actual image of size would be too small to see clearly.
Value for money?...i've only used wired headsets thus far, these are my first bluetooth earbuds so i can't give you an experienced perspective, i can and will tell you that these sound better than even my wired apple earbuds and every set i've owned so far...i'm happy with them for the price i paid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The products department saw the previous review and were right on top of it to accommodate me and send me a new pair. The service was quick and thorough. The new pair seem to be working fine but they are new and I did not start having problems until the 3rd week. I will update if they last that long.

Purchased these April 29 2018, just missed the window to send back. They worked awesome at first, then all of a sudden they started saying battery low then would shut off. I would recharge but as soon as you pulled the cable they would automatically turn back on. You had to make sure it was off or it would drain the charge. Now after having them 33 day its now May 31 2018 and they will not charge and are worthless. This is the third different brand I have had since Christmas and I can't seem to find anything that last.

Didn't last! :( Pricey for 4 month lifespan","UPDATE January 2018:  I hate to say this because initially loved these, but for the price I am now skeptical of their construction.  I'm not a ""rough user"" of headphones.... I don't take them to the gym, I usually use them while sitting at my desk or relaxing.  I use the protective case that comes with them, and I don't use them daily - ,maybe 2x a week. Three months after purchasing these I started to notice the left channel completely dropping out.  I thought it was perhaps a charging or Bluetooth connection issue, so I reset everything and started with a fresh charge.  Ten minutes into music, once again, the left channel starts poppin in and out (I'm sitting perfectly still at my desk) and finally quits. There doesn't appear to be a ""loose wire/connection"" and as I said, I am never rough with them so if it is a faulty wire it's a product of manufacturing.  I notice some reviewers have had similar issues.  I was so high on these buds that I WAS going to buy sets for my teenage sons - but considering they are substantially rougher on earbuds than me, I'm glad I didn't waste the money.  I hope TrebLab continues to improve; I think they have a good product, I'm just not sure of quality control in their manufacturing.  :(

FIRST review 7/21/17: I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, having spent decades in the music industry, and fortunate enough to be exposed to some of the best equipment around. I grew up with the typical over-the-ear ""cans"", (and still prefer them for the ultimate ambient immersion in music) and earbuds - well - those were a necessary evil for today's mobile world.  My favorites through the years have been the Shure Pro line, but again, those are not Bluetooth, nor no they have a mic. For me they offer a decent music experience in a small (but expensive) package.

I gave up on trying to find decent earbuds to enjoy music on the go AND use my phone for calls, so I splurged on various earpieces (mostly Jawbone) to at least go hands-free. My last one just stopped holding a charge a few weeks ago. On a total whim I saw these on a ""Deal of the Day"" for $30, and thought what the heck - the reviews were decent.  They charged quickly, connected effortlessly, and I was absolutely blown away by the sound. Great bass but also the highs and midrange offered crystal clear  and amazing STEREO (left/right definition) and Bluetooth?? Technology has made me feel like a dinosaur lately.

The come with a huge variety of earpieces, and a great case. I'm still shocked at the sound for the price I paid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My husband has noice cancelling Bose earbuds and I've gotta say that my noise cancelling X2 will give him a run for his money any day, and I only paid a third of the cost.  These buds have a very high quality sound, which was number one on my list, they are very convenient and easy to pair with my devices.  I'm still getting use to the phone sounds and clicking for accepting and hanging up on calls, some of calls have been ""hung up on"" while I've been busy walking or working out and mistakenly pushed wrong buttons.  There is also the occasional announcement that you are ""connected"" as you may be moving around in the 30 ft. zone and earbuds will reactivate or reconnect.

When using only one the other end drags the end in your ear out easily

When I learned that these headphones INCLUDED the foam tips along with the huge size selection of standard tips- that was my tipping point.
The sound of these headphones is absolutely amazing. I rode 40 miles with these this weekend and the wind noise was non existent. I have yet to drain the battery to see how realistic the claimed life is, but so far every possible listening experience- from fit to sonic performance have been fantastic.

Other brands of earbuds were uncomfortable, unreliable, and had poor performance, poor quality, and short battery life.
  I compiled a wish list of what I was looking for in a new set of earbuds.  After many hours of searching tech reviews and customer satisfaction surveys, TREBLAB came to my rescue.  I didn't ask for much, only:
  1.  Good Bluetooth connectivity
  2.  Quality sound
  3.  Proper and comfortable fit
  4.  Long battery life
  5.  Noise reduction
  6.  Low profile
  7.  Sweat and water resistant

Not bad earbuds for the price. Just get a good seal in the ear and they deliver.","So I read a lot of reviews about these earbuds and saw several people say that they did not deliver good bass. I am a bass head, I actually play electric and upright bass and for the money, these deliver enough bass for me. I realize that my comment is subjective and anecdotal, but these deliver as much if not more bass than my wired earbuds. I have had many wired brands, expensive, cheap, middle of the road, you name it, and honestly, these deliver for me. NOTE: Like any earbud, you need to create a tight seal when placed in the ear. Maybe that was the issue with others reviewing these. They were unable to get a good seal. These come with several tips, even memory foam. I use the foam to get the best possible seal. I noticed that if they do not have a good seal, the bass drops off. Once in my ear though, they stay in and are loud to me.
Pros: 1 Easy to pair
  2 Fit well in ear
  3 Good bass
  4 Battery last a while

Treblab did give me incredibly good customer service. I was impressed by how quick they were able to assist me. It did take longer than expected at first but that was due to a technical error. They granted me a full refund because it did not fit my anatomical features. The J1's are good headphones if it wasn't for the fitting aspect but this is particular to my features. Even if I did not particularly like the volume control on the side of my head, it did work very effectively. For functionality purposes plus the quick turnaround and customer support, I have updated my rating to 4 stars.

I want to like the J1's. In fact I was touting about it to everyone I know based on reviews. But I believe there is a better product also sold by Treblab compared to the J1. I like to use the product a few times before writing a review and was gifted the headphones for Christmas but I am not satisfied with it. Here are the pros followed by the cons:

- Long Battery Life - I have used it 5 times and it just died on me (total of 9-10 hours at the gym) so charging is in order.
- Comes in a compact, portable,round case that can be taken anywhere with a netted pocked inside to hold earbud tips
- Sound is prevalent and volume can be increased quite high compared to other headphones.
- Pairs instantly once Bluetooth is setup with your phone.

Cons:
- I thought the earfins would be effective. However, no matter how I position these hoping that it would somehow align with some crevice or nook of my inner ear, they are just not comfortable and do not provide the extra support for the earbuds to stay in.
- The foam eartips are comfortable but really block out all noise possible (if that is what you want). They are better than the rubber eartips which literally do not stick inside my ear. No matter how I position them, they keep falling out. It is incredibly frustrating.
- The tangle-free thin wires of the earbuds are a great addition for any company that is selling wire-based headphones. However, they never stick around the back of my neck, where I positioned them. I used the added wire management tool which was not as effective as I thought it would be. I had to use tape to hold the wires together so that both earphones would stay in.
- I think the biggest downfall for the J1's is the volume control on the right side. It hangs right next to my face and I cannot do anything about it. It weighs down the right side so that there is not enough balance with the wire management tool to keep the wires flat on the back of my neck.
- The music at times seems hollow but the bases are nice and present.

Based on Treblab's reviews by customers, I want to like the company. I have been searching the other alternatives to this J1 model that alleviates the problems I described above. I believe the XR800 is made with similar features but has a on-ear hook that will help stabilize the headphones and keep them in my ear the entire time. In addition, the volume control is on the headphone as opposed to being attached to the wire, plus the wire management tool looks like it's a part of the wire setup as opposed to something that is added on to it. Hoping I could exchange these J1's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sadly these don't fit the bill. These Treblab earbuds are really uncomfortable to wear and always come loose even after trying on different setups with the tips. The material is quite stiff and they make my ears sore. I've never had that issue with any other earbuds. I really wanted to love these but I don't. Another huge knock for me was the magnetic feature. It was one of the main reasons I decided to purchase these but the magnet is really weak. With a light touch,  the magnet will come undone.  It's not secure at all. I almost lost these many times because I my hoodie strap will touch it slightly. Luckily I caught it on time. The phaiser magnets are much better in comparison.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I thought I would have to jump through many hoops to get a replacement, but the process was simple and the representative was kind and helpful at each step. It was so refreshing to see how much this company cared about its product and customer service!

I was hoping that some of the shortcomings of the actual product could be attributed to the defective pair, but alas, the biggest issue remained:
The Bluetooth connectivity is hit or miss (this was something I noticed after extensive use post-review, and once again after I received my replacement pair). My phone (Galaxy Note) is in my back pocket, and the J1s are charged up, but every commute I had instances of ""skipping"" or disrupted broadcast. I suppose it is possible I got the ONLY TWO sets that have this problem... or maybe my body absorbs Bluetooth signals. At any rate, it prevents me from being able to give this product 5 stars.

I am enjoying the J1s, as long as I keep my phone in my hand or lap or on my desk.

<Original Review>
Bought these for myself and as a gift.

PROS
Sound quality - (Note: I am not an audiophile) Audio is crisp, clear - honestly, not much different from wired earbuds.
Battery life - so far it has been lasting the 9+ hours as advertised.
Magnets - strong magnets. It is satisfying when they snap together
Noise cancelling - It's about what you can expect from passive noise cancelling. There are plenty of extra ear pieces (which is good because the foam ones seem to disintegrate in my ear)

CONS
Ear pieces - the foam ones fall apart in my left ear for some reason.
Microphone - pretty hit or miss. I thought there was technology to negate wind or something when speaking. I was talking in an office, and apparently background chatter was too much, or the mic did not pick up my voice enough. Really disappointing because I gifted this to a friend who is a salesperson to use for sales calls... and he had to go back to his other bluetooth earbuds.
Battery gauge - (I could be missing something) but there is no way to know how much charge is left on the earbuds. There is a voice signal when battery is low, which means you have about ~15 min left of listening. But aside that, you cannot know if you have 90% or 30% charge left.
Charging - The cable has a tag that says ""USE ONLY THIS CABLE TO CHARGE"". It looks like a normal micro-USB cable, but it's slightly smaller. I accidentally plugged my regular micro-USB into the earbuds, and it fit snugly. Then I noticed the tag on the included cable and switched. It fits more easily. Not sure what the consequence of using another cable is... but it is inconvenient in any case.
Pairing - Pairing with a single device (my phone) is perfect. Trying to subsequently pair it with my ipad or laptop for work is very fiddly. I think I was spoiled with the BOSE QC35s because they can pair with so many devices.

Overall, I think the product is acceptable. They work well for listening to music for a workout or on commutes, but the mic is not reliable for calls, especially work calls. The cable, pairing, and knowing how much charge is left are minor quibbles.

BOTTOM LINE: The audio is good, but did not blow me away, and the mic is mediocre. I am generally pleased with this product, especially for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is my very first pair of Bluetooth headphones I've ever owned. I'm not an elderly person, I'm not unable to figure out electronics, I'm also not somebody who refuses to accept change. I just have never liked the idea of wireless headphones. Especially the airpods because I think people look absolutely ridiculous with those in their ears. These headphones however, are pretty damn good. I've only charged them once, work out about 45 minutes 5 separate times on the charge, and there's still over 50% battery life left. It's not weird getting used to them like I had thought, and the sound quality is probably the best I've ever heard from a pair of headphones anywhere near this price range. They do cancel almost all noise from inside my gym. All I've heard was weights crashing. I don't heard the gyms speakers, other people grunting, or anything else. The sound is also pretty loud. I'm uses to having the speakers at almost the highest setting for loudness, and now I'm just barely passed halfway. Time will tell if they hold up to sweat and daily use in the gym, but if I get a year out of the, I'll be impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I pretty much exclusively have used these for running when they worked and they did fine there. They don't have a functional cord shortener like comparable products so you'll need to be ok with the cable riding on your neck. They are advertised as being waterproof, yet both pairs stopped working in the same amount of time with the same use. So either they are not waterproof and sweat is causing them to sotp working or they are simply poorly made. Eitgher way I wouldn't recommend these.

They've been cared for as directed, yet each pair stopped charging after 3 months. They replaced the first pair after it stopped working, but would not replace the second pair and only offered a discount code to purchase a new pair when the second pair had the same issue and stopped functioning.

If you're looking for a decent pair of minimalist wireless earbuds at a cheap price I'd looks elsewhere as these have unfortunately not met expectations.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They only thing I wish they had was a clip on the cord to attach to a shirt  to keep the cord from migrating to the right hand side, which is the side that the control switch is on and probably weighs a bit more than the left side.

Pairing is painless and the audio feedback on Power On/Off provides positive feedback as to the state of the earbuds. Passive noise cancellation is better than I expected - I was using them while sitting only 7 - 8 feet from a TV my wife was watching and the TV sound was basically inaudible.

Overall, the product does what it is supposed to do. I would not recommend the product for an audiophile, but the rest of us mortals who just want to listen to music while at the gym or going for a run will do fine with the Treblab J1. There are 3 points that should be noted:
1) maximum battery life is 5 hours (I workout 2.5 hours per session and always have to recharge after 2 sessions)
2) for a regular sized person, the cable connecting the earbuds is about 6 to 7 inches too long.This somewhat negates the benefit of wireless earbuds which to me is freedom from wires.
3) sometimes the + volume button makes a strange, loud, searing noise.
4) the ear pieces are not perfect, but then, my ear canals are not perfect either!
I have learned to work around these issues, and overall, I'm enjoying the product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Pros:
  - cheap
  - stays in sweaty ears
  - comes with a nice case, and the magnet to keep them together is handy
  - bluetooth connection is reliable and simple
  - tracking forward and backward with remote control is supported
Cons:
  - sub-par sound, slightly worse than the free earbuds you'd get w/ an iPhone
  - though they won't fall out, it takes a lot of adjustment to get a snug fit which isn't distracting, the heavy cord which connects them causes movement which makes a distracting noise in ear
  - the beep indicating you've reached the volume limit is LOUD and painful to the ears.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_77?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=77&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them for indoor running and weight lifting. However, after only a couple weeks of use they started to cut-out, loose connection, and finally they died. I need music to power through my workouts so I really annoyed with these earbuds.TREBLAB J1 Bluetooth Earbuds, Best Wireless Headphones For Sports Gym Running. [2017 Upgraded] IPX6 Waterproof Sweatproof, Magnetic Secure-Fit Headset. Noise Cancelling Earphones w/ Microphone Mic

Update: I am upgrading my feedback for the following reasons:

1) Produtech have really great consumer service, they reached out to me and resolved my dissatisfaction by issuing me a replacement pair of earbuds. I had a great experience with this seller and would not hesitate to purchase from them in the future.
2) My replacement earbuds have been holding up pretty good so far. I am a runner and a good pair of earbuds is a MUST for me to be able to enjoy my workouts. The fit is good, I don't worry about them falling out of my ears, even when doing burpees, and mountain climbers. The sound good, not great but pretty good, I get full range sound with decent bass. The bass is a must for me, I've returned other wireless earbuds for lack of bass.
I'm happy with my replacements so far and will be buying another pair for my wife. I believe that my first pair may have failed due to sweat getting inside the circuit, I sweat a lot. I recommend that you try to keep these earbuds as dry as possible. I run with a little sweat towel that I use to occasionally dry my ears and the earbuds. After my runs, I let the earbuds sit outside of the storage case for a couple hours to dry completely out before attempting to charge them (Highly Recommend this to prevent issues). Other then that, these earbuds are a great value compared to several others that I have tried at this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

They sound absolutely fantastic, but I have a few issues with them.  I was hesitant to buy them as I've never used earbuds with the inner fins to hold them in place, and I was afraid they would be uncomfortable.  And they are.  It doesn't matter what size fins I use or how I position them, they actually become painful after a few minutes.  However, using the noise-cancelling foam tips keeps the earbuds in place without the need for the fins.  The silicone tips don't hold them in, but I prefer the foam tips anyway.

So, that was solved and I was happy again.  Then, after the third or fourth time I wore them my ear was a bit itchy after taking them off.  After figuring out that there was something inside my ear and having to dig it out, I was holding a small round piece of metal in my hand.  I immediately recognized it as the mesh speaker cover from one of the earbuds.  Not only had the cover come off as you can see in the attached photo, but it actually fits through the opening in the foam tip with no problem at all, which allows it to go all the way inside your ear.

So now I have a major dilemma.  I love the sound from these things, and I know that I could simply put a tiny speck of glue on the mesh and put it back in, but the combination of the intolerable fins and now the questionable production quality of the product makes me seriously think I'm going to return them and go with a different brand.  If it was only the fins I could deal with it with no problem, but I really don't like having to dig pieces of my earbuds out of my ears after using them.  But I hate the idea of giving up the fantastic sound of these things.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Coming from a more comfortable fit from Klipsch, this was to be expected but I haven't had headphones this uncomfortable in a long time. I've owned everything from Beats to Skullcandy's. I have tried all the included tips and fins and the headphones were still very uncomfortable.

Poor Noise Islation
These headphones boast their noise isolation but I was fully able to hear the subway while IN the train. I have plenty of other headphones that completely block out noise

Volume Not Loud Enough
I had to listen to most of my music at full volume while I can get away with 75% volume using other headphones

Poor Sound Quality
Tinny sound from songs that are crystal clear in other headphones. The bass in songs muffles the vocals entirely with these headphones.

Poor Connection
Even with its boasted aptX technology, I found myself noticing songs skipping every once in a while. Not a major con but enough to be an annoyance. Headphones had greater than 75% charge when I was finished with my commute so it wouldn't be a power issue.

Final thoughts:
These would make a great pair of headphones if they fit well in your ears and you'll be using them solely indoors as the noise isolation is just not enough for a city environment, and its poor handling of connections with wireless signals in a crowded city will drive you nuts. If you don't live in a city area, this may work for you.

Update:
The manufacturers/sellers have attempted to contact me with a canned response to my review which completely disregards everything I have mentioned in my review covering multiple pain points.. I'd take away that final star if I could, for the insult.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also own a pair of Anker SoundBuds Slim, in my opinion the sound is similar to the J1.

My disappointment came as a traveler, hoping that these BUDS would be noise cancelling. They failed to deliver.

Perhaps I needed to experiment with the variety of ""sponges"" that Treblab includes with this set, but I felt uncomfortable messing with those while sitting between strangers in flight. I simply increased the volume to override the hum of the jet engines.

I am sorry for the negativity, but I was disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-Waterproof-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones/product-reviews/B06ZXR7646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"
