I was tired of using wired headphones, and I wanted to cut the cords and get away from multiple untangling sessions every day.  They were very easy to set up, and connected to my Android right away.  I put Pandora on, and found that the sound was very tinny, with no bass (compared to a wired set of earpieces like from SkullCandy or iPhone).  I downloaded the Sound+ app and boosted the bass all the way up, but there was very little change in the sound quality.  After about an hour of listening, I had to take a phone call.  It switched without issue, but the quality of the phone call audio was even worse, with the voices of others on the call sounding very weak.  I had to crank it all the way up, which made it audible, but I had to make sure to turn it down before I went back to music.  I am very disappointed, and will be returning these after only 90 minutes of use.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_323?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=323&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Really satisfied with the performance and they sound on par with my ol lady's Bose Soundsport.

They come with a downloadable app that's great. They have a locating feature, hear through ( which I love and allows you to hear surrounding noise without taking the product off), and different sound modes.

Amazon has you rate the noise cancelling, but they're definitely not noise cancelling. They're noise isolating, which they do pretty well. Really snug fit in your ears without causing irritation.

I've tried so many well regarded earbuds and either they were a hassle to work with, had connection problems, were too bulky, sounded cruddy, or most of all couldn't stay in my ears well (i apparently have very difficult mis-shapen ears for earbuds). So it's a RELIEF to finally find great earbuds that work, aren't a hassle, sound very good (maybe not the best though - depending on what you like), and STAY IN MY EAR!  And that's before even mentioning how well the batteries last on this thing.

I bought the Actives (for the extra $) just for the moisture protection. (Turns out a few weeks later when i told my date, she found them for cheaper than the non-Actives!)

SOUND: tight. clean. clear. I am an audio engineer so my preference is for ""reliable reproduction of sound"" aka sound accuracy. I'm not into boosted bass or trebles or any enhanced sound. Just give me reliable repdroduction of what the original recording was designed to do and I'm happy. That means, clear trebles, non-muddy mids, and clean/clear (albeit not boomy) low-end. This fits that bill! Rare!

BATTERY: long-lasting. i've only run out once (and that's after a flight and 1+ train ride home from a quick weekend trip). Sound quality remains constant (as far as I could tell on a flight and train ride lol) until battery life ends.

NOISE ISOLATION: these are very interesting in the noise isolation department. If you are wanting NOISE CANCEL - these will not fit your needs however, You DO get ambient noise for sure. however quite interestingly, the ambient noise is controlled to a non-intrusive vs intrusive level. The things you DO want to intrude (subway train stop alerts, flight overhead alerts, cars around you) - come thru. The things you don't want to intrude - train noise, plane noise - you definitely know it's there, it just doesn't intrude to the point where its' distracting you from your music.

FIT: no earbuds have ever truly fit and stayed in my ear. The design of these ""locks"" pretty decently and easy to get in your ear to the locking position. (Slide in, rotate backwards until it ""locks"" or stops). True to form, I do have to adjust them now and then but by far, I have to adjust these far less than any other i've tried. My focus is on my music moreso than adjusting fit. A first for me.

PRICE: compared to a LOT of earbuds i've tried, not too bad. Right in the mix or cheaper. I was starting to expect i needed to up to the $200+ level to get what i want but thankfully i do not.

CHARGING (CASE): This is the one area that could be easier. Because of its unique design (that makes it fit/lock into ear better for me) also makes it not so obvious how to place these into the charge case - because the ""lock tab"" is straight forwards). the mold in the case doesn't help figure it out. Also, the earbuds, although they stay in your ear well, tend to easily fall out of the charging case when you open it up and are ready to put them in. So there is a danger, if at the wrong place at the wrong time, you could easily lose an earbud opening the case and it dropping to the ground -  if that ground has any cracks or holes.

OVERALL: I've already recommended this to others and they also have reacted with ""FINALLY!"" after they got these too. The reviews that helped me decide to give these a try are true. These are probably your best bet if your budget meets the price (which I'm guessing it will, as most quality wireless earbuds are in this range or higher).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Plenty of bass, mids, and highs.  I also have the Bose QC25 and the PowerBeats and these sound better than both of them.  The QC25 still do the BEST JOB EVER of cancelling noise on the airplane, but these do a pretty good job.  Note, these cancel the noise out because they fit inside your ear like an ear plug and as such if you turn off your music, they won't cancel as much noise out as when the music is playing, they are not active noise cancelling like the Bose QC25.  The issue I have with the Jabra is two fold.  #1 when you're eating on the plane or at a café the motion of your jaw actually causes your ears to decompress as well, and they will slide out of your ears.  This may be resolved by using a different size tip, they come with 3 sizes, I used the medium.  #2 issue is most important, the Bluetooth performance is subpar.  Sometimes when you put them in, the left ear does not work, and it's a real chore to get it working again.  There are no clear instructions provided by Jabra on how to resolve, but in my opinion they should JUST WORK.  The other issue I had was talking on the phone, people said they had difficulty hearing me when I was at a noisy coffee shop, so clearly they don't do a very good job in noisy environments of talking on the phone.  Overall this is a great product but I was not happy with using them to talk to my coworkers on the phone and having to fight with the left earbud all the time, so I returned them.  Note: these sound a MILLION DOLLARS BETTER then the Apple Earpods.  The Earpods are a JOKE!!!  Do yourself a favor, even if you don't get these Jabra ones do NOT BUY the Apple ones they sound the same as the factory headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was concerned that since these did not have an ear hook (like bose) that they would not remain in my ear.  However they fit just fine and they are awesome.  I knew from some of the reviews that bass was lacking and that's a true statement.  I have a pair of jam wireless earbuds that have way more bass but they are not as comfortable as this pair.  So it seems that I had to trade base for comfort which in some cases are ok .  The only time the lack of bass really bothers me is when I listen to a song that I know that has a great bass line and its not there.  Don't get me wrong the bass is there but not like overpowering.  However I would still reckoned this pair, the left and right bud have never lost sync with eachother.  however you can listen to the right bud in solo mode I have not figured out a way to listen to the left on in solo mode I am not sure if its possible.  It seems like more people want to chat to me on my right side than my left.  I have not been able to exercise the app yet because I am out to sea on a ship with no wifi and to exercise all of the features you need internet.  So if you don't have internet don't expect the extra features.

UPDATE: Since I have been able to upload the App and they also updated the APP recently I know think this is the best pair of wireless earbuds on the market. Being on facetime and phone calls is a blast with these.  You don't have to raise your voice you can speak natural and the caller on the other side can hear you just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Also, I am finding that I am constantly resting them into my ear as they begin to slide out.  Especially if you try to eat with them in.  The movement of your jaw works them out of the ear.

Some have been very bad and some have been amazing. My Sony WI-1000X are by far the stand outs of the bunch. These Jabra earbuds appealed to me because of their compact design. Jogging with collared headphones can be irritating at times, so I thought I would enjoy this lightweight solution.

These earbuds are a mixed bag. I think it will be easier for me to format this review with a pros and cons.

Pros:
Lightweight and wireless
They have a feature where if you remove one from your ear it autopauses. (great for the office)
Easy one touch functionality.
Call quality is very clear

Cons:
Sound Quality is missing A LOT of low range, very mediocre sound
Requires a special case to charge - if you lose it, you're out of luck. The flimsy hinge on the case broke within a week.
Not a lot of customization available in the app

Overall, for the price, I think there's probably better out there. They're certainly nice sized and convenient, but I find that proprietary charging systems are never a good thing and the sound leaves a whole lot to be desired.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tried a couple other headsets and wasn't fully on board, so I was eager to try Jabra again, and I chose this product.

Pros -- Decent UI through my iPhone, and using the controls on the earbuds themselves is easy to learn.  The sound cancellation is decent, cutting out about 95% of sound which is good enough for me.  I had one bud fall out of my ear once at the gym, but I was on a bench that angled my body on a decline; I also wear my buds a bit loose (see cons).  The case isn't too large, so it doesn't feel like you've got a huge bulge in your pocket (giggity).

Cons -- They don't hurt, but there is a snug pressure like I'm several feet underwater.  I have not tried the other ear fittings yet, though.  I do pull the ear buds out just a tiny tiny bit, wearing them ""loose"" when I'm at the gym, making micro adjustments when I'm on different stations.  When they're in (even just one), I can hear everything in my head; I can hear my breathing, I can hear the pulse in my head, and it is annoying.  When listening to music, my left ear bud will occasionally cut in and out.  When making calls, occasionally there is a bad connection, and I hear a terrible sound.

I enjoy using only the right ear bud while shopping.  I utilize both ear buds with little annoyance when I'm at the gym.  At the office, they are useful for calls, but they're not something I'd wear continually.  They are preferable, however, to larger headphones that can be heavy after extended use.

Would I buy these again?  I don't think I would.  It's not a bad product, and I'd actually recommend them to other people, but they're not right for me.  I've owned for a few weeks, so I've had time to acclimate to them--and it's not happening.  Considering I used some reward points on my Amazon card, I got these for a good price so I intend to get my money's worth out of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have these true wireless earbuds paired with my iPhone 7 Plus and my Apple Watch the sound quality is unbelievable. My go to headphones were the V Moda M100’s the M100 are amazing in every way but for the gym I wanted a nice small pair of true wireless earbuds. So I went with the majority of people and bought a pair of Apple air pods. After numerous times of picking them up from the gym floor I decided I wanted inear wireless earbuds so I pick up a pair of jabra elite active. I now have my AirPods to my son. The sound on the jabra is amazing. There is no video lag from streaming services like Netflix or YouTube and best of all they stay in your ear the extra features on these earbuds just put it over the top like the hear through feature and the auto pause feature when you pull out one earbud. With the addition to the jabra application the sound quality is perfect for any type of music you want to listen too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_312?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=312&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have tried several others.  The one thing that I learned was that cheap earbuds are just that...cheap.  I looked at many different products after trying cheaper brands, and finally decided to purchase these.  They work very well.  The sound quality is excellent and it generally syncs up without issue.  I use these mostly at work and in the car.  For an earbud, I don't think you could ask for anything better that is currently on the market.

Occasionally, the left bud does not sync.  I believe this is an issue in which it was not seated properly in the charging container and possibly turned off.  In any case, I just put both earbuds back in the charging case (watching for the light on each to let me know it is properly seated) and then pull them out one at a time left one first.  That usually solves the issue.

I have also noticed that the buds cannot go as far away from my phone as another bluetooth headset that I use for working out.  This other headset is not an earbud though so again it's like comparing apples and oranges.

These buds seat very well in the ear and block out external noise when the proper size tip is selected.  This is beneficial to me specifically because I have a hard time deciphering voices when there is background noise.  The downside is a loss of situational awareness.  There is a pass through function, but it sounds odd.  It may seem that way to me because I am used to electronic hearing protection for shooting and this is not comparable to that type of device.

Overall, this is a great earbud.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unreliable.","These headphones are great when they work. I would say every day, at least once, the headphones will cut out for about a second. That is only mildly annoying. The real annoying part is that every time I put my earbuds in the charging case- they do not turn off and start charging. Sometimes they will turn off right away, but they always reconnect at some point. So if I am talking on my phone without the earbuds- all of a sudden without doing anything they will automatically connect to the earbuds. Super annoying. And it just ends up draining the battery.

I reported this issue to the jabra support team and did not receive a response. Then I decided to call. They said they would send me a new charging case-assuming that is the issue. It has been over two weeks and still nothing has happened.  Called back in and was told that I would receive an email with shipping info by Monday. We’ll see... but the fact that this will take over 3 weeks to take care of after contacting them 3 times, I would say I am not very thrilled with these earbuds. Hopefully they can fix this at some point soon before I give up and just return them.

Wanting to buy some wireless earbuds that weren't the atypical ""airpods"" I looked for sometime on Amazon and other sites at various other options. Reviews for pretty much everything were all over the map; some great, some ok, some terrible. This was also true for the Jabra Elite 65T earbuds. After more research, I settles on the Jabra earbuds for a couple reasons; calls are routed to both earbuds making it easier to hear the call, the design of the earbud case is nice and it fits well in the hand - not to mention it holds 2.5x charge to keep your earbuds charged, the app is great for tweaking the sound to your liking. While not ""heavy"" in bass there is enough there to provide a balanced sound which is pleasant and sharp. There is a small multi-colored light on the bottom of the case which indicates the charge level of the internal case battery pack; presumably, green = 80%+, yellow = 30-80%, red = <30% (or similar). On long flights, I've managed to get 4-5 hours of battery life out of the earbuds before putting them back in the case for a recharge; not bad. One feature I also like is that if you dont have them in your ears all the time (like me), when you get a call on your phone, once you've inserted both earbuds the Jabra's automatically accept the call for you. I use these predominantly in an office environment or while on business trips in airports, etc. Never had an issue with sound quality or the connection dropping; so far they have been super reliable. Not sure they (or any earbud for that matter) are perfect for working out and although I've never had an issue with one falling out while I've been walking around, I'm not sure I'd be wearing them on a full run. But, there is a different version of these Jabra's which are aimed squarely at users who plan to do lots of running with these earbuds. Overall, from my 3-months of use, I really like these earbuds; they've changed my life in some ways and its awesome to be no longer using a corded headphone. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love the design and found the sound quality to be decent overall (both audio and microphone). The issue I have is that mine broke after 3 weeks of use. This is bad enough for a $200 pair of earbuds, but it got worse when I tried to get a replacement. Initial call to customer service didn't result in anything happening (I was told I would get a follow-up email, did not). Then I'm informed that to get a replacement, I have to send back the broken earbuds, wait an unspecified amount of time for them to be ""inspected,"" and only then will I receive a replacement pair. This process could take upwards of 2 weeks. For a $200 pair of earbuds. That I just purchased.

Contrast this process to what happens when you buy Beats (they send you out an immediate replacement with a box and pre-paid shipping label to send your old ones back, ensuring a much faster and more hassle-free replacement process) and Apple (they replace their earbuds on site in any store or send you out an immediate replacement).

Like many customers, I purchased this with the intention of using them for work. This means that not only do I need a reliable product, I also need responsive customer service. This is a big reason I have always stuck with Apple products; they back their product and provide exceptional customer service once you've invested your money in their brand. Jabra is competing directly with Apple here (the Airpods were the only other earbuds I considered). My advice would be to go with Apple and skip Jabra if customer service and quality is important to you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_273?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=273&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was really pleased with their performance for the first three months.  The sound quality is on par with decent wired earbuds and I had no issues pairing them with my various devices.

However, at the end of March, the charging case stopped recognizing my right ear bud.  As a result, I've been unable to use the earbuds since then.  On April 5, 2019, I contacted customer support and, after waiting 30 minutes, was able to speak to a rep.  The rep instructed me to e-mail a picture of my charging case, which I did that day.  On April 10, 2019, Jabra e-mailed me and asked me to send them a proof of purchase in order to complete my warranty request.  I provided proof of purchase that same day.  Over a week later, on April 22, 2019, I received an e-mail saying that Jabra was shipping me a replacement case.  Great!  Or so I thought.  I waited a week and did not receive confirmation that the case had actually shipped.  Earlier today (April 30, 2019), I again called customer support and was informed that the charging case is backordered and that they would let me know once it is in stock again.  As you can imagine, this news was quite frustrating.  They did not inform me about this information until I reached out to them.  Also, it appears from their website that the gold version of the case is in stock, but they did not give me the option of receiving that case.  It has now been nearly a month since I reached out to Jabra and I still am not able to use my earbuds.  I have to say, I expected better customer service given the amount that I paid for this product.

I am a tech junkie and am always on the look-out for new toys.  These headphones sound great. They paired immediately.  Whomever is listening to my talking on the other end, CAN HEAR WHAT I AM SAYING!  That was most important to me.  I had Airpods and they were clear and sounded great but kept falling out.  Irritating.  These totally stay in place, and are almost as intuitive. However, they did  take a little getting used to.  After an hour or so, my ears were a little sore were the housing rests against them, but after about a week, that is not an issue anymore.  The noise cancelling is pretty good, and it has multiple size buds to choose from.  But, you have to use the ones that come with these or they won't fit in the charging case. (sounds like Airpods) that is my only complaint....  I prefer foam buds and have not found any that fit into the case.

And they fit my ears perfectly & won’t fall out. They have a good rich sound. If you download the application you can alter the EQ settings for more or less base,  treble etc. On YouTube videos I noticed a slight delay which didn’t sync with the video. But on Netflix it works perfectly with no delay whatsoever. All in all I would highly recommend these to anybody that can’t use the airpods from Apple.

Claimed battery life and water/dust resistance is nice.

Noise pass-through (lets you hear outside the buds) worked well enough (not high quality but did the job)

Wide Assistant support (Alexa, Google, Siri, etc)

Auto detection of removing from your ear to pause, and resumse music when you put it back worked very well.

Sound quality was pretty great, with good bass but not quite as much as I would have liked, even after attempting to correct with both the equalizer in the Jabra app, as well as using the music app's, Poweramp, equalizer. I got distorted bass much much easier than my current wired Audio Technica ATH-CKS55USBK which I never got distortion unless I went looking for it.

THE CON: This is the con that had me return these. There a very high noise floor that I could not remotely ignore, as well as a clicking sound. You can hear the noise/hiss when there is no media playing or a not-loud song or show, same for the clicking sound. I tried everything I could, such as disabling DVC (Direct Volume Control) on my Pixel 2 and while that helped reduce the noise/hiss, it is still present with no media playing or a quiet song/show. INCREDIBLY disappointing. It reminded me of cheap headphones but I am shocked to hear it on a $170 MSRP product. If you are walking around in public and jamming, you won't notice is at all. But if you are in a quiet office or not next to a freeway outside and have your volume at a lower level because the environment doesn't demand higher volume, you can hear the hiss/noise quite easily. That was a deal breaker for me. I had my Audio Technica headphones with me, and used them both on my phone and on my work computer with the same music and had no hiss at all, even with DVC on. I compared back and forth in 30 second stints of the same parts of songs. Such a let down on trying to go wireless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The second time for a run and i covered my ears with a headband so they wouldn't fall out but they kept feeling like they were going to fall out. The third time I went for a walk and it was windy and a big gust of wind came and the left ear bud blew right out of my ear and onto the ground somewhere. Seriously, not lying!  I took my coat and hat off to see if it got stuck in there. Nope.  I search the entire area on the side walk, under cars, in the street, in the black mulch (which is the similar color of the earpiece) and I couldn't find it anywhere. So $170 down the drain with a gust of wind!!!!  I even used the smallest ear size piece.  These just aren't made for all ears.

They connect to my Pixel device automatically when removed from the case and I had no issues with the initial bluetooth pairing either.  Please be advised that these are earbuds that fit into your ear canal, so they are meant to seal out the outside noise, much like a ear plug.  The Jabra app then allows you to customize how much outside noise you want to allow back in.  In practice this has worked well for me.  Once the amount of outside sound is calibrated it can be turned on or off simply with a double tap on the right side.  This may not be for everyone, like if you constantly use your earphones in an outdoor street environment where you want to hear all the traffic then get some earphones that are not the sealing type.  The connection in outdoor environments has been great too, easily can go on a run with these and they will not fall out and connection to my phone never drops.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_393?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=393&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve tried many many of them over the years, from wired cheapies to top of the line Bluetooth noise canceling units. While these Jabras don’t have quite the sound of an excellent over-the-ear unit (especially in bass response), they are extremely well thought out and executed. Here’s why:
1. Battery management. Most small earbuds like these have poor battery life, presumably due to the small form factor limiting battery size. These Jabras have pretty good battery life on their own, but what makes them stand out is the auxiliary battery in the case. So, you can use them in the gym for a few hours and then just put them in their case and have them fully charged next time you need them. Great solution.  In addition, the earbuds automatically turn off when you remove them from your ears, eliminating the trauma of finding dead earphones when you need to use them.
2. Versatility. I like to use only a single earphone when running or biking on the road, so I can hear traffic noise. The problem with  other earbuds is that you wind up listening to only half of the music (the stereo channel that you have in your ear). The Jabras automatically switch to mono when you remove the left earbud, so you never lose the sounds from the left  track.
3. Comfort. While I know comfort is based on personal taste (some people can actually tolerate the torturous rocks that Apple calls  headphones), IMHO these are the most comfortable earbuds that I’ve ever tried. They just fit perfectly if you choose the right cushion size, and never come out of your ears even when sweating profusely.

Jabras sells a sport version of these which cost $50 more and are purported to be more sweat-proof and stay better in your ears. However, when you register the 65t’s with Jabra they give you a 2-year water- and sweat-proof guaranty, so I decided to save some money and go with the standard 65t’s. As already stated, there’s no problem with slippage, so it seems like a good bet so far (I’ve been using them daily for a little over a month now)

So why only 4 stars?  It depends on how you’re rating them. Compared to other Bluetooth earbuds on the market, they really deserve 5 stars. But if overall audio fidelity is your overarching concern, get a good pair of over-the-ear headphones like Bose QC-35IIs. While the Jabras have excellent clarity and high-end frequency response, they won’t give you the boom that you’ll get with good quality larger drivers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just finished my search for a true wireless earbud. I tried a few pairs under $60, a pair of $100, this pair and the Bose Soundsport Free. The cheap pairs, forget about them. Their lack of bass sound was enough for me to put them back in the box and send them back. The mid priced was decent, but I wanted a bit better sound quality. Since I have always been a Bose guy, they met my criteria of quality sound, but lost me due to the phone calls not coming from both earpieces for the best phone call experience. Also they do look a bit bulky because they do stick farther away from the ear than the others.

These Jabra Elite 65t earbuds have great quality sound when I listen to music as well as being able to hear phone calls in both ears. The noise canceling works really well. The only downside about these is the way they fit in the charging case. The other earbuds, including the cheapie earbuds, were all held securely in the case by built in magnets. These fit rather loosely in the case so I have to kind of wiggle them a bit to make sure they are properly seated before closing the lid.

I've been wanting true wireless earbuds for hiking and trail running and these received some rave reviews. In order for them to stay in place, they require a snug fit. Unfortunately, that snug fit for me is uncomfortable to the point of being painful after a while. Using them for the second time, I wore them for 50 minutes and was more than ready for them to be out of my ears. Worse, I lost track of how many times the left one popped out of my ear. They come with several tips to optimize the fit in your ear canal, but that fit also depends on your individual anatomy. In my case, there didn't seem to be the right combination of snug and comfortable. Others have raved about the snug, comfortable fit, so they may or may not work for you. One more nitpick: I and my adult daughter found the storage case ridiculously hard to open. If the earbuds had stayed comfortably in my ears, I could've lived with that annoyance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_274?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=274&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I still have not quite got used to being able to walk around listening to music or talking on the phone without having wires trailing everywhere. I know that Bluetooth functionality of this kind has been available for a while. But I was completely underwhelmed by my partner's AirPods. In my opinion, the 65T's are well above the standard of those AirPods. Someone has sat down and thought these things out from the very basics. They are very impressive.

However, let me get my one real criticism out of the way first.

There is no microphone auto-mute or mute-from-the-earpod capability. This seems to be a bizarre omission. Why give customers the freedom to wander around anywhere if they can't mute the sounds by which they're surrounded unless they tug out their phones? I gave up my Pioneer Rayz wired earphones for these 65T's, and if there is one reason that I would go back to the Rayz it would be the lack of the auto-mute feature on the Jabra earpods. It's a nuisance. Another reviewer has suggested that a firmware update could fix this. Come on, Jabra! If Pioneer can do it, surely you clever Danes can do it!

Now for the good stuff:

Fit in the ear: There are warnings about fit problems in various reviews. I had no problem. In fact, I paid too much attention to what other reviewers said: I really did screw the earpods into my ears, with resulting discomfort. In fact, all I need to do is pop them in. With the large earbuds, they work well as long as there is a seal at my ears. And once they're in, they stay in.

Sound quality: Good enough for me. This is so subjective a topic that that is all I can really say. There is a 5-band equalizer built into the Jabra iPhone app. I'd prefer a 10-band, but the 5-band is OK and is adjustable. I listen mainly to classical. If you are a bass nut you may want to check out someone else's 65T's: I can't advise you based on my listening preferences.

Bluetooth connectivity: Excellent. Some people have complained that they couldn't maintain a connection with the iPhone in their pocket. I have no problem from one end of our small house to the other.

Jabra 65T app: I've seen complaints about this as well. I don't really understand why: it seems to do everything it should (except for the microphone auto-mute!) and is reasonably intuitive to use.

Single earpod use: The ability to use just the right earpod for phone calls is a nice touch.

Phone sound quality: People cannot tell I'm on a Bluetooth headset. 'Nuff said.

Charging: A clever system of small LEDs tells you whether your case is charging or needs charging, and the battery level of the earpods themselves.

Overall, I'm very pleased. However, I've had them only 24 hours. If they turn out to be defective in some way in the near future, I'll update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Do you follow the herd and get airpods?
2. Do you spend the money and get Sennheiser or Bose ear buds?
3. Do you go with these jabra headphones.

My advice is to do anything but option 3. The fall out on runs, the 'hear through' feature is worthless, and they'll randomly drop connection. Those are just issues with daily use. After less than 90 days, sound stopped coming through the right earbud. I submitted a support ticket - all I received was an automated reply that included instruction on how to restart the headphones... but I played along and did it, problems persisted. It took them 2 weeks to get back to me with another canned response on how to send them the headphones for warranty replace. It has now been a month since they received my headphones from UPS and I have heard absolutely nothing back. My emails get absolutely no response and I've attempted to call several times, each resulting in 30 minutes on hold with nothing to show for it.

Read a lot about this product- on Amazon, on Souq Amazon's affiliate in UAE where I bought these), and many other websites. Was not sure if I should for the Elite 65T or the Active. Eventually chose the Elite (non Active).

Packaging
Delivered in original packaging. Very well packed. It would be perfect for a gift- from such a large box emerges these 2 small earbuds. Set Up Was quick and easy. I didn`t require the Jabra Sound app to set it up. Just a slight touch on the right earbud and my phone found it within seconds. I use an Android- Galaxy S8.

Sound Quality
Excellent. For both music and phone calls. Haven't done many calls with it as yet but the music sound quality is exceptional. I use it primarily when I am running. Have done 1 5k and 1 3k in it and they were a perfect fit- didn't loosen, were fitted throughout the run. Unlike other headphones, which need to be `shoved` back into the ear every 20 minutes or so, these didn't require that. I also downloaded the Jabra Sound app and played around with the sound frequency settings- reduced the treble and increased the bass.

Other stuff
Music pause: Music pauses every time you take the right earpiece out or when you receive a call. Excellent feature and works flawlessly every time.
Powering off: You don't need to worry about switching it off if you are going to put it back in the case.
HearThrough: This is the special feature of Jabra which let's you hear regular conversations while listening to music. You can toggle it on and off. There is a perceptible difference in your experience (positive) when you put it on.
Noise cancellation: the others haven't complained as yet about my voice when I talk to them- again not many calls as yet, but initial feedback is good.
Battery Life & Voice Assistants Haven't had an opportunity to test the promised 5 hours+10 hours. But hopefully should hold up. Also haven't tried it with Google Assistant/Alexa.

Recommended: yes. I am sure the Bose equivalent are good too. Had tried them in the store- and the sound was excellent- but didn't get good feedback online, about noise cancellation. Also the small features in Jabra like HearThrough make the difference. I bought Jabra not because of the features I ready about- but recommendation of a friend who was using them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But then I started using them, and everything works so flawlessly that I just can't go back to any other model. The sound quality is great, it's comfortable enough to use for hours, which is also possible because of the great battery life. And there's basically zero connection problems, even when I used them in Manhattan, where I could also make phone calls and the other side heard me perfectly. The audio passthrough mode is extremely useful when you don't want to be isolated from the world, and it also connects to two devices at the same time, so I can use it on my phone and computer without disconnecting anything, whenever there is audio on one of the devices it goes to the earbuds. The connection stability especially is something that now I take for granted, then each time I use a different pair of earbuds and the connection drops I really appreciate the work Jabra did on making this work so well. The only problems I see are with the controls, which are in no way worse than any other model, but so far no brand has really been able to make great controls on true wireless earbuds, and this is no different. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Also, and this one I consider unforgivable given how good it is otherwise, I still can't understand who had the brilliant idea of using micro USB instead of type C. Really Jabra? Basically EVERY other device I have uses type C, so I can use the same charger and cable for my computer, phone, Nintendo Switch, portable charger, EXCEPT for my 65t. And some of them are older than the earbuds, so why not use a technology that's new, better and readily available instead of an old one that basically no one else uses but cheap products? And if there is one thing the 65t is not is cheap. That's the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star, other than that it's an awesome product that's years ahead of basically all competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very snug for the noise cancellation which I like, but caused right ear soreness. What im worried about is if you have both pods inserted and remove one them, then the other detects it and the sound turns off. Reinsert the removed pod and the sound is back. So there is a signal among both pods to determine if your pods are in your ears based on distance. Since this is the case, then there is a constant, radio wave I’m assuming, crossing your brain to keep the sound playing. Begs the question if there can be any damage, although it takes a lot of radiation to damage brain cells, since they are highly selective cells and differentiated. Maybe it’s thought as an X-ray, you won’t feel adverse effects, if any, for approximately 25 years.

PROS:
- Solid and well-made.
- Comfortable and weightless for the first 30 minutes of use.
- Good-enough volume.

CONS:
- They don't stay in the ears for long, usually falling out after about 30 minutes, even with the largest rubber pads.
- Extremely frequent audio dropouts with my Google Pixel, which stays in my front pant pocket. This never happens with my car or bluetooth speaker. Maybe the headphones are so small that they don't have room for an adequate antenna.
- Terrible bass response, even with the equalizer cranking the bass frequencies to the max.
- Google Assistant integration is much more basic than I had hoped.  You don't get anything like the Google Pixel Buds. Instead if you long-press on the right headphone you can start talking to Google Assistant, so all it really does is save you the step of saying ""OK Google"".
- Not sure why, but my phone battery drains extremely fast when using these headphones, which doesn't happen with my car or bluetooth speaker.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_264?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=264&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In order to get the best experience you have to download the 2 Jabra applications and install the software update. Then play around with the EQ settings.
The other thing I did was to install the  ""Speaker boost"" application (increases volume).
Finally I went to my phone settings to developer options ,go to ""disable absolute volume"" and enable it. This will allow you to increase the volume from both your cellphone and from the left earbud.
I am using a Samsung Note 8 which supports Bluetooth 5.0 . The connectivity is very good and no disconnects after walking away 15 feet .The earbuds are very light and fit perfectly in my ears.They block out a lot of background noise.The microphones are very powerful .Phones call audio is crystal clear. The charging is very convinient in its case .Not having any wires is great!
 I have used these for 4 hours straight for phone calls and music and the battery was still going.

My only con is that these dont support codecs such as Aptx ,LDAC or Samsung HD. Only supports SBC and AAC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main thing I love about these is the battery life. 5hrs using both at the same time!! And they're not bulky either. After using these for a couple months I can say that's pretty accurate. The passive hearing is good but the problem I have with it is that if you lower the music the passive sound also goes down. The app allows you to set how much sound to pass through but seems pointless because if you lower the volume of your music it literally turns down the output of the speaker. The app is great too but I wish the status bar that's always at the top of my phone would also display battery life or an option to turn on and off the passive hearing rather than having to open the app for both. Fit is good but not great. While I was surprised that the design does actually keep the buds in my ear even during workouts but if they're placed even slightly incorrectly chances are they'll fall out. Putting them in correctly involves a twist and tug basically. Talking on the phone is pretty good too. They can hear me clearly with no issues. Also I just discovered I can shut off the automatic pause option when i remove an earbud.

They're pricey but worth it. This is my sixth pair of wireless headphones in the last 5 yrs I got off Amazon. None before had the features or quality of these and I don't completely regret those purchases but if you add them all up they cover the cost of these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_305?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=305&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I shopped several headphones and here are the results of the headphones I tested out.

JayBird Freedom 3
Let me start off by saying I had the JayBird Freedom 3 headphones for 5 years and although I was satisfied with the customer service of JayBird the Freedom 3 Headphones feel out of my ears while running.  I sweat more than the average person due to my hard long runs and these would never stay in my ears past 3 miles.  Overall I was happy with JayBird Freedom 3 but would not purchase again because they would not stay in my ears ruing my runs.  If you are lifting weights or doing light easy runs then I would recommend these simply due the great customer service.

Bose SoundSport Free Wireless Headphones
These headphones are one of the most expensive on the market and worth it just for the sound alone.  I used these during my hard runs and they stayed in my ears during the whole run.  As mentioned before I sweat a lot and they passed the test.  The sound quality is top of the line!!!  Awesome sound!  There are two reasons why I didn't keep these head phones.  1. When taking phone calls they would only have audio in the right ear.  This was awkward to me and I like hearing out of both ears.  2. I was very proud of my new Bose Headphones (True Wireless) so I showed my wife and her first comment was ""you look like shrek!!"".  I didn't find this funny so looked in the mirror and realized they stick out of my ears and to my surprise I did look like ""Shrek"".  Overall these headphones are awesome, stay in my ears, great sound, and worth the price but just didn't work for me.

Jabra Elite 65t Alexa Enabled True Wireless Earbuds with Charging Case  – Titanium Black
After wearing the JayBird Freedom 3 and the Bose Soundsport I wanted to test the Jabra Elite 65T.  Overall this are great earphones with ""True Wireless"" Earbuds.  Sound quality is not as good as Bose but still exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is great in the Charging Casae.  These headphones stayed in my ears during a 8 mile intense run.  As mentioned I sweat alot and these stayed in my ears with no issues.  They do not make me look like ""Shrek"" and are comfortable.  I used them to take phone calls and audio is in both ears....like this feature.  Easy to set up out of box, easy to connect to bluetooh, can connect to two devices.  Look great, feel great, and work great.  The pair I purchased do not have the heart rate monitor feature as I never use that feature anyways so didn't need to spend the extra money.  These headphones I am very happy with and an excellent ""true wireless"" feature.  I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for a top of the line quality ""true wireless"" earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried all three sizes of the supplied ear buds, settling on the large.  This would work ok but due to the shape of the plastic body of the unit, I could not get it inserted deeply enough into my ear canal to stay there.  That said, they sounded very good immediately after inserting into the ear.  Bass was very present, and overall tonal balance was very good.  If your ear canals aren’t too deep, these may work well for you.
  Phone calls - Phone calls also sound good when you have a good seal in your ear.  There were some times that I had to move calls to my phone because there was too much background noise for the person on the other end of the line to hear me.  So far, I have yet to find a Bluetooth set of earbuds that was very good at background noise cancellation for the person on the other end of the call.  That being said, these were some of the best of the ones I’ve used.  This is almost impossible to do well without a microphone right next to your mouth.

I listen to podcasts all day while I work at my desk, so I need a set that's comfortable, works well, lasts a long time, and most of all sounds really good!  I looked and looked and tried (literally) dozens of different sets before I took the dive and bought these.  I was hesitant because they are so pricey, but clearly the less expensive ones weren't working for me.

These earbuds have made listening and talking on the phone with them a pleasure!  I can walk around with them (with my phone in my pocket), go into the store, and go from talking on the phone to listening to music or podcasts (or even YouTube if I desire) without missing a beat!

One thing that surprised me but has become one of my favorite features is that if you remove one of the earbuds while you're listening to something, they automatically pause whatever it is you're listening too!  Not live calls, of course, but what a great feature!  Now I just take one out if I'm walking down the hall and someone wants to talk to me and not only can I hear them, but my media waits for me to be ready.  OUTSTANDING!

The charging case is excellent.  I keep it charged so I can have the earbuds in my pocket and they'll charge from the stored charge in the case!  WOOHOO!!!

Unfortunately, the silicone ear inserts are not that good inevitably causing them fall out during my workouts (at least one side does).  And, that is a big problem because one side fell out in the middle of a set today at the gym and I could not find it.  It seemed to disappear!!!  Had half the gym looking around the floor for it and we just couldn't find it.  I was sure it fell in a crack somewhere and I probably would never retrieve it.  Finished my workout and then returned for one last look before heading home and behold I found it (YES!!!!).  Clearly someone had either stepped on it or dropped a weight on it because it was pretty beat up.  Happy I found it but was sure it was fatally damaged.  However, once it got home and cleaned it up, to my surprise it works!!!  I couldn't believe it!!!  If you could see what it looked like you wouldn't believe it came back to life (should have taken a picture of it).
Summary - Other more expensive headphones may sound better but, I promise nothing will stand-up to the abuse of the gym the way these do!  I'm convinced they will stand the test of time, as long as I don't lose them first...

In the YouTube app on iOS, the audio and video are out of sync with these headphones. Apple says it's a Jabra issue. Jabra says to contact Google and Apple. I have multiple other bluetooth headphones and have never had an issue with audio/video sync in the YouTube app. From my read, this is a Jabra issue that they refuse to deal with, or just don't know how to fix.

Also, in any slightly noisy environment these headphones are useless for making phone calls. The noise cancellation feature cancels your voice and raises the background, switch to your phone from the headphones and you sound great.

My case now pops open in my pocket somewhat regularly, and these aren't even a year old.

This is either planned obsolescence, or just poor industrial design. But what irks me is the environmental impact that a single bad choice like this has.

And when I get to work place, it is a real pain in the ass to switch from earbuds to earphone(or the opposite) which is connected to Macbook.
So I was looking for multi point supported earbuds. I bought this Jabra Elite 65t supports multi point for 2 devices.

First impression's great. The product is well made and app's functionality is great. Sound quality is average but app has adjustable equalizer function. Battery life is ok especially with charging case. Charging case is small enough to put it in a pocket. Auto pairing is convenient but other BT earbuds do this as well. And I love hear through function by double clicking earbuds button. But about multi point functionality is not exactly what I imagined.

To switch from Mac to iPhone, there has to be a certain event like starting to play music by specific application or getting a phone call. So I was watching youtube from iPhone and then I click mouse button which make warning alarm sound on my Mac. It starts sending sounds from Mac(after alarm sound there's no sound at all). It doesn't go back if I pause youtube and resume. I have to switch to different app then get back to youtube and resume to change the source of sound.

I think it has better chemistry when using with iPhone. Connection to Macbook seems a little unstable. It gives me quite frequent pause of sound when connected to Macbook.(Maybe this is why they release a new version with usb dongle)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They were wonderful for the first few months, however recently my experience has degraded significantly.

Here's why:

1. The headphones no longer disconnect when placed in the charging case. This means I have to manually disconnect them via my phone's bluetooth settings. However oftentimes when I do this they will automatically reconnect a few seconds or minutes later. This requires me to either turn off the headphone by holding down the right ear button, or turn off bluetooth completely on my phone. I usually end up having to completely disable bluetooth for a period of time to avoid unintentional reconnection. I assume this is because the headphones are no longer making a solid connection to the charging case despite my attempts to clean the connection pads and pins.

2. The charging case no longer provides the headphones with two full charge cycles. In fact I'm lucky to get a single recharge from it. This is basically unacceptable as comparably priced devices offer 20+ hours of on time via the charging case. I now have yet another device that requires nightly charging.

3. The bluetooth connection quality has degraded substantially. Especially while running or moving quickly while exercising. The connection quality was great at first, but now drops in and out despite the phone being in my pocket. No idea why this has degraded. I do sweat in them, but that is why I purchased the active model.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Speaking of battery life, it's not bad but it's not excellent. It's just average. I liked the charging case and the buds themselves look very good.

Also liked the built in Alexa functionality. Calling was OK; again not horrendous but nothing to drool over either. I liked the outside sound pass through you can enable via the downloadable app, made it very easy to talk to people while not having to take them off.

However for their price tag it really isn't worth it anymore. It's a slightly above average product for a very premium price tag. Instead I bought a pair of Melomania 1 from Cambridge Audio and the sound is on par (slightly better imho but everyone is different) and the calling is fantastic, as well as the insane 9 hour life from the buds and an extra 36 hours on the Melomania 1 case is just too insane.

Can you imagine? They constantly disengage themselves from the silicon tip and fall out of my ears leaving the tip in my ear. One popped out and fell in a river right after I bought them. I got a replacement and tried to like them,,,ya right, they're terrible. Auto connect is a terrible idea: these turn themselves on from time to time  and connect for no reason. A real pain The app is totally useless, for ex. I want to be able to take out the right bud as I don't hear well with my left. No matter what I do with settings they disconnect as soon as I remove the right one. Volume is very low. I guess there is supposed to be a control on them  but I haven't found any way to affect the volume level. Sound quality is about on par with another pair of earbuds I got off ebay...for $8. Not $170. Jabra should be ashamed for charging more than $30 for these; and that's more than they're worth. The Jabra 65t is the worst electronics purchase I've ever made.

The biggest issue so far is charging. The case has no indicator that the earbuds are charging. There is a LED that lights up green, but it goes off within 2 seconds. I've twice now opened the case to find my ear buds not charged. I dont know if it's because they are not touching the contacts. There should be some sort of indicator that tells the user they are charging.

The second issue is the pairing. I am a right handed person. When I'm taking 1 pair out of my ears it's the right one. The problem is that if you take the right one out your music can keep playing. It just goes into mono mode. So now I have to get used to pulling out the left bud instead.

But so far I like the sound quality. I just wish the charging was handled better.

Edit:
I forgot to mention that if you take out both buds for too long. The left bud will power off. When you put the two back in your ear the left one will not have sound a a result. You have to force it back on before you can get the stereo sound back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound on these are not as good as the bose but the latency is WAY WAY better. The EQ on these are a little flat, I don't understand how some reviews said that they are bass heavy cause they are not. The fit is really good, just make sure to try all the ear tips for the proper fit. These do not block out as much noise as many other reviewers have said but they do block out some. The sound through feature does work pretty good in an office setting but when I went running with these, I would use the app and the earbud itself to turn on and off the sound-thru and could not tell any difference, I could still hear traffic around me. For calls its ok but not great, make sure that the buds are pointing slightly down towards your mouth so the other person youre talking to can hear you well. I do like that it has an app to modify the EQ and sound-thru feature. The case is a finicky to get open, you'll have squeeze the sides and then pop up the middle. I was disappointed that the buds are NOT magnetically held in place like my old Crueser wireless earbuds. They do connect to my phone almost instantly which is great. I got these on sale and I got these to replace my crueser wireless earbuds that I loved but gave to a good friend when he wanted to borrow them and loved them too, if not for that I would not recommend buying these at the original $190 price and wait for a sale or buy some other cheaper brand. These are overhyped and should be a cheaper price and again had it not been for the two reasons stated above, I would have not bought these.
Do I recommend these? at full price... NO! on sale.. ok but I would recommend doing some research on some other buds at around or less than the sale price on these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They sound great, are wonderful for phone calls, don't look obnoxious like the Bose and most other truly wireless headphones, and just plain work. Always. I haven't had a dropped signal at all in the past month plus that I've been using these. And the battery life is typically more than twice what I need. I was on a call for 3.5 hours with no issue. Also, these go into your ears easily and stay there. The app to control all the settings is simple and useful as well.

The only faults I've found with these are 1) I've been told (after asking specifically about it) that some outside noise during calls can leak into the call. Nowhere near enough that the person on the other end can't hear you, but enough that they can tell if you're walking around in the city or a park or riding a bike or something. And 2) They don't smoothly go back and forth between your computer and your phone. It takes some work to switch up the bluetooth connection. Of course, Jabra never promises that this will go smoothly. Instead, they say that these are optimized to work with your phone. Neither of these faults are a big deal to me, but may be useful for you to know.

If you want an excellent set of truly wireless in-ear headphones, I don't think you can currently do better than these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This one has really good call quality. The only thing is it's slightly bulkier than my previous ear buds and you need to learn how to put them in your ears, takes a little getting used to.

Anyways,  I have purchased a set of $40 GRDE EARBUDS  before and the was ok, and they sounded terrible with calls. So I saw these jabra 65T earbuds and figured I'd spend a little more $. They are not perfect,  however the sound is great, the fit is great with the correct size rubber piece. the battery life is about 5 hours on one charge which isn't bad. They dont bulge out of your ear like the Bose earbuds. the case on the other hand feels cheap like, one drop and it will break. I have not dropped it (yet) but I'm in the marines and I workout alot so in time I will drop it Haha.  I really think the price is a little high but not to extreme. they do connect as soon as you remove from case, also when you remove them from your ear they pause your media which is nice. They are small so a little difficult to remove from the case and ear if you have big hands. Now the noise cancelling is not the best, It works ok when activated and when it's off you can hear just a little more noise around you. When you receive a call it tells you who it is and you can say ""answer or ignore"" instead of picking your phone. I find this feature great, especially in the gym. Overall, I like the product and would buy it again. One last thing, it has ""find your earbuds"" as well, and when your near them you can send a signal to them to make a high pitch noise so that you can locate them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Looks and construction : They are very low profile and the color (blue) looks premium. The headphones and case feel like they are made of the same material and it feels sturdy. Some folks mentioned the case opens up accidentally but I didn't have this issue.

Usage : Despite being so small they never slipped out, even once. The case is bit bulky in the pocket so have to play around with that so it doesn't look like you have a bulge. The buttons are hard to use - as in it hurts the ear to press them. You need to hold the unit while your press them so they aren't pushed further in your ear. Also it's very easy to press the wrong button (because they are so small)

Sound : Music sounds good but leaves a bit desired for a premium bassy feel. Volume control and range is adequate. The pass through feature works but not the greatest. Customizing the EQ didn't help as much as I was hoping / reading up it would. Hopefully an update is sent through soon.

Calls : The audio was great but the mic didn't isolate just my voice which lead to the other person asking me to repeat what I said repeatedly. Also you have to really speak up to be heard so maybe not the best option for public calls.

Battery : I haven't done a proper test but since I got this couple weeks ago, on a single full charge, this baby is still performing great!

Connectivity : Easy to pair and customize in app. But the Bluetooth range is subpar. When my phone is my left back pocket it cut off quite frequently (the Bluetooth receiver seems to be in the right headphone). But when I had my phone in my right pocket and a heavy bag covering it, it worked just fine. Strange.  You need an additional app to make the Jabra Sound+ work which is again strange. Also charging is still on micro USB.

I feel that this is a great product and should definitely be something you consider the next time you are looking for true wireless headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought these based off of the phenomenal reviews from the big publications about them being superior to AirPods, and from anecdotal reports of neighbors walking around with them.

However, while they might be better for non-Apple users, I think that iPhone/iPad users would be better served with AirPods or Beats.

Regardless of how you feel about the increasingly siloed nature of manufacture ecosystems, staying in Apple's ecosystem seems to yield the best results. I'm comparing the Jabra's with my two pairs of BeatsX headphones, which are an Apple product and use their proprietary W1 chip technology.

With the Beats, the connection with my phone is nearly instantaneous. I turn them on, and they're paired. There's a noticeable delay with the Jabra's.

With the Beats, I hold down the voice activation button and Siri comes up nearly instantly. With the Jabra's, you hold down the button, hear a beep from the Jabras, wait two seconds, and then hear the Siri tones. This delay in activating Siri is what's currently bugging me the most.

The final major difference is that once the Beats are paired to one Apple device, they're essentially paired to all of your devices that are attached to the same iCloud account. With the Jabras (or any non-Apple bluetooth device), you have to manually pair each device individually.

There's also been a lot written about how well the Jabra's design blocks out more sound than the AirPods, and how the ""hear-through"" technology provides the best of both worlds for isolating noise but also allowing in the amount of noise that you want.

However, the sound that is digitally piped through is not natural, and you won't confuse it as just ambient noise. It's clear digitized and processed. And in many cases, ambient noises seem to confuse the earbuds and get translated into weird, annoying beeps.

Overall, I think they're fine buds, just not as good as I was hoping after reading the great reviews. And I'm pretty certain that Apple users are better off with AirPods or Beats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Battery life, I am using them connected to 2 devices, desk phone and cell phone. Music playing all morning, 5+ hours of battery life, even with Hear Through on. Put them in the case during lunch, complete days worth of use.
Dual Connection, I can play my music and can pick up calls on my desk phone. It pauses the music while on the call and resumes when I hang up seamlessly.
Size, the ear buds fit me perfectly, they do not stick out like Frankenstein bolts. They do not fall out of the ear.
Comfortable, I have been wearing them 5-8 hours a day since my purchase. I have had no comfort issues.

Dislikes,
Sometimes when connecting there is a high pitch noise.
Mic sensitivity, there is no adjustment and it works too well. In the office when I am on the phone, the people on the phone can hear other conversations that are 10-20 feet away from me.

The battery life is more than enough for me the never really run out of charge, I charge them every 2-3 days. I also ride a motorcycle and in my helmet they work well for canceling out the sound or playing the noises through the speakers. And once I try the earbuds extras I found the size that fits in my ear well. I've had pebbles from the weedeaters hit my earbuds and they never scratched or stopped.

Well built and sound is very nice (although I am no audiophile).  However fitment was a real problem for me.  The left ear kept falling out - even when I was just sitting.  The right ear was fine, but the left ear was a problem and I found myself often on all fours looking for the lost ear bud.

I workout in a large commercial gym and get distracted easily, these block out pretty much all sound and deliver super clear, loud sound. The bass is very impressive too compared to most other earbuds. The Sound+ app is super helpful too and lets you configure different frequency ranges so I can enjoy my music how I like.

However, it's an extremely uncomfortable product. They give you different sizes for part that goes in your ear, so that isn't the issue. The problem is that the rest of the earbud is designed to rest in a indentation in your ear, for (what I assume to be) bass and noise cancellation purposes. This part can be super uncomfortable if it's too large for the space, and if it's not jammed in then the earbud falls out. I find myself removing the earbuds between sets because my ears would hurt too much.

Secondly, this is the second set of these earbuds I've received from this company. Both have had problems with the left earbud. With the first, the left earbud kept cutting in and out before eventually just not working at all. These cut in and out nonstop for probably the first 10 minutes of operation, but then stabilize.

Overall, you can get good earbuds for much cheaper than these. Save your money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The mic is so sensitive that the person on the other end of your call could hear a pin drop, the flip flop of your flip flops, a passing car or strong breeze, and the unspoken thoughts of significant other. Seriously though, the mic is so sensitive that you cannot use the earbuds to take calls in a public place. Its even difficult to use them outdoors as every sound, natural and man made, is picked up.

I'm happy with why I got them, but disappointed with odd unexpected issues:

Biggest issue I have is the sound channels are unbalanced. The left bud is slightly louder than the right one. I've returned and exchanged them twice, so that's 3 pairs and I noticed the unbalance on all 3. It's very subtle, but I believe all the headsets have this issue. Seems like most people's hearing is not sensitive enough to notice but it bothers me enough to alter the balance levels on my phone to compensate.
I've talked to support and they might be adding a balance slider to the sound plus app.

Next big issue: intermittent white noise in left bud. Sometimes the left bud will have this hiss while playing audio. I can make the hiss go away if I take off the left bud (this disconnects them from each other) and put it back in my ear and the hiss goes away for a while. Again, all 3 pairs I've had experienced this issue.

Next issue: hear through (the feature where you can hear your surroundings) It cuts out constantly in the right bud, when I navigate my phone. It works consistently if I'm not using my phone, but for some reason, navigating the device causes constant annoying ambient sound skips in only one bud.

Despite these issues, I plan on keeping these, and hopefully the issues get corrected in firmware updates.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve had no issues in the 3-4 months I have owned these. I keep them in my pocket and put them in when I just need a musical escape or want to take a call. These connect easily with my iPhone and other than the app which for some reason likes to disconnect the earbuds (maybe 3 times since I’ve had these) but easily fixed.

Not the world's best sound quality, but perfectly acceptable for my needs. However, I've run into two major problems with these earbuds that make me question the quality of Jabra products.

I purchased these on December 16, 2018. On February 28, 2019 (about 2.5 months later, I began having major issues with Bluetooth pairing. Every time I go to use these with my iPad or iPhone, I first have to de-couple the Bluetooth connection, reset the earbuds and re-couple with my device. EVERY TIME. Obviously this is unacceptable.

Then, the next day, the right earbud began playing at 25-50% volume. That is, with the volume set to max on my device, I can barely hear audio from the right earbud. The left earbud plays at max volume, however.

I'm very disappointed. Given the high price I think it's unacceptable to have these major problems after less than 90 days.

I've contacted Jabra customer support (which is of course closed on weekends); we'll see if Jabra lives up to its warranty terms.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_305?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=305&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also have a pair of Jaybird X3s and I like those as well, but I wanted something without the ""cord."" I was looking at the active model, but I was also deciding between the Bose SoundSport, the Jaybird RUN, and this one. This one was the winner as the price swayed me.

It initially came with the medium tips attached to them and the fit was good, but the sound wasn't what I expected...…...but when I switched them out for the large, that made all the difference and the fit was much better. I did download the app and I'll toy with it to dial it in. I'm holding out for the 5 star on the battery life until I get more use out of it. Not bad for the price of $130 as of this writing.

Working a job that requires time on the phone and out and about, I needed something that could be used for calls handfree and with quality sound.

For the first week, they did make my ears sore. But after that I had no issues with comfort, and the battery life was great and quality of case and ear buds were nice. Could connect to work phone and personal at same time with seem less transition. People could not even tell I was using an ear piece to talk with them.

However, after about 2 weeks, I could have my phone in my pocket and simply turn my head and the sound would cut out. Emailed Jabra and was simply told to reset. Did not change anything. Then, when in a somewhat loud environment (anything that wasn't within my car or at home) people could hear the outside noise more than they could hear me, even when the surrounding sound was minimal. Emailed Jabra again and they never responded.

I am not an electronic snob by any means, and these seemed so perfect for the price point. But being unable to use them for calls while walking in public completely defeated the purpose at a price of $190. Sure, they are great for listening to music if you look directly at your phone the entire time, but beyond that prepare to be disappointed if you need them for anything more. Terrible customer service and a mediocre product. There are plenty of other options out there for strictly sound quality for much cheaper. Hopefully the tech improves over time and I would love to try them again.

Luckily I was within the return window at Best Buy and got my money back. Solid materials and battery life, but no need for $190 to listen to music with these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_275?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=275&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Poor Call Quality - I've seen these headphones advertised as having good call quality and it was even reviewed as such by CNET and several other consumer tech blogs. Got them for that reason but am very sad to say that they are really no better than the other wireless headphones on the market. They will pick up any and all background noise and drown out your voice with it. After going through Bose Soundsports, Jaybirds, and other Jabras, I think it's safe to say that there is no product that bridges active performance and call quality.

Sound Quality - I am no audiophile but will try to present a useful perspective based on my experience with other headphones. If you are also not an audiophile who geeks over ""highs mids and lows"" then rest assured that these are plenty good for our plebeian ears. Compared to the Bose Sound Sport Wireless that I used to own, which generally gets top sound quality reviews in the active-branded headset genre, these sound a little less bass heavy with equal clarity.

Features - The app really unlocks a lots a lot of innovative utility from these headphones. The ""hearthrough"" feature is actually quite good, effectively allowing you to toggle the noise cancelling feature of the headphones - I get a lot of mileage out of this feature when running and walking through the streets as well as in my open office, where I can leave it on when it's quieter (so it's easier for my teammates to get my attention when needed) and turn it off when the space gets noisy. An equalizer (that I admitted don't use that much) makes it easy to adjust the mix with an appreciable effect. Different preset modes can be customized too allowing you to control almost everything the headphones do.

Fit - This will obviously vary with each person's aural anatomy but I was really surprised by how well these buds fit and stayed in my ears. I frequently run sprints and circuits on an open field. My old Bose Sound Sport Wireless, which at that time were in my opinion the GOAT of fitness earbud fits, frequently got jostled loose during these workouts. I was then surprised that I never encountered this issue with the Jabra Elites! No matter how rough the movement, these buds stay in. I have zero anxiety about every having these just fall out of my ears and into the gutter, as is common with wireless bud owners. That being said, I do recommend that any prospective wireless bud consumer try out any buds on their ears to confirm fit before shelling out $200 as this is bound to vary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sometimes I can't here at all or is breaking up during phone call.

It also has a software problem.
Play/pause button does not work properly.
In podcast, It works.
In Youtube App, I can pause the video, but I cannot restart it.
In one app, I can play the audio with a button, but I cannot pause it.
I don't think that it is a physical malfuntion. I think it is a kind of software problem.

Anyway, I have reft inquiries about these problems on their website,
If they could not give me solutions for this problem in a few days, I will return it.
I think I will never purchase the product of this company.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Used them for few months now, Bluetooth connected instantly, and dropped only when next to strong electrical sources or interference like Air Condition systems in the gym.  The controls that I used worked intuitively and flawlessly, and sound is great (during workouts).

Take one star off though because the awkward battery case:  hard to open, and unintuitive way the buds fit into their seats.  I dropped the right bud several times when struggling to open the case.

I am a former Jaybird X1, X2, X3 earbuds.  They are good, smart designs with excellent customer support.  And that's precisely it.  They required great support because they don't last long.

******PLEASE RESPOND******

Hello Ryan, so far I’ve tried the reset, firmware update and the voice guidance language updated and I still continue to have issues.

1. When I put the ear buds back in their case they remain connected to my phone. I have to manually disconnect them.

2. Then when I want to use them they don’t connect automatically, I have to Forget Device, turn off Bluetooth and turn on Bluetooth, put ear buds in discovery mode and connect to them.

3. Even after connecting to them just the right ear connects. I have to hold down the left bud button for it to join.

I have to repeat this process for both commutes to work and back as well as when I’m at the gym. I shouldn’t have to do that for headphones I paid $180 for.

If it fits :(","I've been looking for a decent pair of headphones/earphones for almost a year now. Started looking into some Sennheiser in the beginning and moved up to almost $700 with B&O's (h8 & h8i) and some other brands as well. This one is just great. It doesn't have an amazing sound but it so convenient and well designed, it definitely worth the price, however, it needs to fit well. It fits great to my right ear but somehow it feels terrible on the left ear. It is quite frustrating as I tried so many earphones and I really wanted to stick with this one as its super conveninent.

Let me put it this way. I've loved this earphone so much, for a split second I thought of the modifications I could do to MY EAR to make it fit comfortable!

The foam around the earbuds, the ones that fit into your ear, keep falling out and while they'll be HAPPY to sell you another 20 dollar proprietary foam earbud.

But let's say you have an unlimited supply of foam, what else is the experience like? Miserable. The sound quality is pretty good but they're constantly slipping and falling out, the proprietary charging case (the only way to charge them, of course) only works with the proprietary gels, so if those slip off they're completely useless. I really, literally think jabra just purposely handicapped this product to scam it's customers.

Do you know what I never wanted to spend as much time as I just have thinking about? Earbuds. Do you know what these things mean that I have to spend much time out of my day thinking about EARBUD MAINTENANCE? I know tech company executives probably love that, but do you really want to spend time out of your day thinking about earbud management? I know I don't. It's the exact opposite of ""It just works"".

This is one of the worst products I've ever bought. Expensive, easy to break, and expensive (and impossible to fix) all for foam gels. Even if you have the money to buy replacements, and I do, they're out of stock.

Please please please do not buy these headphones.

I wish I would have researched more before buying. Theres a bad batch and or the sound app is causing an issue.  Right earbud all of a sudden lost 90% of its volume. I contacted jabra via email  for warranty  replacement. No reply  I had to call a few days later to see if they recieved my email, they did just ignored it.  They played dumb like none else is having this issue. I jumped through all the hoops unpaired, updated, uninstalled sound app, reset earbuds, sent in copy of receipt.  It took forever for them to reply  after that.  Dealt with Felipe  and Josh.  Finally they said they their shipper would send a return label and for me to send back the earbuds and case,  then they would inspect it. And then order a new one and when it arrived they would send it out.  (Online reviews say this process takes weeks)  I said ok.  Waited, never recieved.  Dont know where to send and I am not shipping back $160 earbuds back to corporate without a return slip.  Called them up again after a few days,  they said they cant issue another return label because they paid for one that I never recieved and I would have to pay for the shipping. I said fine email me info on where to ship, waited for days never recieved.  Seems they want to make it as difficult as possible to fulfill a warranty  claim. I sent out email after email to the generic warranty email that some random person checks,  finally recieved  an email back from Sarah apologizing  and saying a return label will be sent out right away, I thanked her and waited  for days.  Nothing.  So far this is about 7 weeks with a right earbud at 10% volume.  Sent out an email a day for a few days  and  uninstalled the earbuds, reset them, uninstalled the sound app, cleaned up the charging case and earbud  contacts with a qtip and rubbing alcohol.  Then the right earbud started working better maybe 80% volume. And now the left earbud is at only 20% volume  sent in another email inquiring if they have heard of this, if it is a battery issue or the software.  Got a response back real quick from Olivia saying I voided the warranty  by ""performing unauthorized repairs""  at this point it has been two months, of broken $160 earbuds.  Manufacture cost is probably  $20 , but they chose to have an unsatisfied  customer have to leave a bad review and let friends family and coworkers know dont by jabra they no good/defective.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Of course I have other wired headphones with better sound quality, but when it comes to an wireless earbud that stays in my ear, is sweat resistance for workouts and has an above average sound quality, these are awesome. The biggest complaint and the reason for this review is the lackluster customer service. Everyone that I did speak to was very kind, but response time was poor and I was not offered an acceptable solution. My right ear bud started to go bad 3 weeks ago and I contacted support to open a case on 4/10. They had me go through different diagnostics to try and solve the problem but ultimately it did not fix the issue. I then had to go through the site to file a claim to have the product replaced. It is now 2 weeks later and I finally received the return label. The problem is that they will not ship the new ear buds until the current ones are received. I travel constantly and will be leaving the country for 3 weeks in five days therefore I called customer service to ask if there was another solution... even if I gave them a credit card number to send out a new pair so I would have them before I travel but apparently the only solution they can offer me is for me to return the current buds which will take 3-5 days to arrive and then they could expedite the new ones to me in 2 days. For the price of this product and the fact that they stopped working correctly after only 4 months, I feel that the company should do more to remedy the problem. Now, I will have to buy a different pair of wireless headphones before I leave because my current pair does not work. I will not be buying Jabras this time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If we're being honest, they're worse than a decent pair of wired IMEs.  I ended up buying them because my new phone doesn't have a headphone jack, and I figured I'd try something new.

If we compare them to the other ""True Wireless"" ones I've tried, they do pull ahead in terms of feature and overall performance.

My top considerations:
- getting a good fit can be hard, but it's doable given the tips provided.  I ended up having a different sized left and right tip.
- they are comfortable enough for the battery life.  I wouldn't imagine wearing them for more than four hours.
- the charging case is a little cheap, but it works fine
- connectivity is decent, but I still had some dropouts
- noise isolation is just OK, and volume doesn't go high enough for some aspects of my commute","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_311?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=311&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The setup and connection was very simple, the sound quality is good, they block the outside noise very well, and they stay in the ear perfectly.  So far, I have no complaints.

After installing the app and tweaking the settings, I took it for the usual test and burn-in period. They sound great and look nice (I got the navy-copper color). You can find general reviews online so I won't bore you with the specs and such.

My problem with them is the HearThrough feature. I specifically got these earbuds because of this feature, which utilizes the onboard mic on each bud to pick up ambient sound so you can hear your surroundings even if you have them on and listening to music, as they have pretty good passive noise isolation. Unless the ambient sound is LOUD, it doesn't get picked up, i.e., you don't hear it. For example, I can barely hear mouse clicks even though I'm less than two feet away from it, and even then, I'm probably making the connection that it's supposed to be making a clicking sound. I tried to have a conversation with someone with this setting turned on and it simply did not work.

Furthermore, I noticed a crackling sound on the left earbud whenever HearThrough is on and the mic is picking up a high-pitched sound, such as jingling keys, glass hitting glass (as in microscope slides), etc.

Without HearThrough off, the buds are great. But I feel like at this price point, everything should work. The last firmware was released on December 2018... if it's a software issue and there's a fix, it should have been released by now, which leads me to believe it's a hardware issue. I contacted the Jabra customer support so hopefully they have something.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit for my strangely shaped ears is very tight, but that is on me. At least these things have no chance of falling out. I suffer from extremely sensitive ears and have an embarrassingly small ear canal. After dealing with some discomfort and pain I found a position that works very well.  In fact, I keep them in my ears every chance I get for as long as I am able to and my ears just don't get fatigued and that's saying a lot for me.

I love the built-in white noise options, they are amazing when I want to tune out the world and get focused on study.  However, the hear-through option doesn't let me hear enough of the outside world to keep them in around my wife and kids all the time, but the hear-through works well enough.

They do not have the best sound canceling options when making phone calls in very loud windy weather, but in normal situations they are great. No one calling me can tell I'm on the phone with earbuds.  It feels magic to be not only handsfree but truly wireless. Stepping away from my phone with earbuds in works great if I pop downstairs for a sandwich.

Connecting with Google Assistant is akin to a Star-Trek Next Generation moment. It works amazing with Google Assistant on my phone and if I had an Amazon Echo Dot set up, I'll bet it would work just as well. It does take some practice to push the buttons. The charger case is amazing and it's not actually a big deal they don't get held in place with rare-earth magnets. It would be nice if they did, but it really isn't necessary.  The trick is to squeeze the sides of the case very firmly (long-ways) while you pop open the top. I never run out of batteries although I got down to 9% after two very long sessions.

The app interface is good enough and I love the preset equalizer options to switch from listening to audible.com and podcasts to rock n roll music.

If the phone calls had the better active-sound cancellation and the hear-through option could pick up the soft-spoken people in my life I'd give these earbuds more than 5 stars. But there is room for improvement on these two very important features.

I've read every review and watched every youtube video on these earbuds. I've spent an embarrassingly long time researching all the front-runners of truly wireless earbuds of 2018 and Jabra Elite Active OR Jabra Elite Sport beat them all.

Also Amazon delivered them to me by 8:45 PM the same day I ordered them around 10:00 AM.  good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are great except for two big deal-breakers for me

1. They are uncomfortable. When I wore them for moderate lengths of time they really started to make my ears sore, to the point of causing me to dread putting them on. And if I don't want to wear it, why bother?
2. They block out noise really well. Well that may sound like a positive, it actually was an annoyance because I would have to physically take out my earbuds when I wanted to hear something to talk to someone. But because they are wireless earbuds, I can't just let them dangle, so I have to awkwardly hold on to them in the meantime and risk losing them. Sure there's a hear-through mode, but the sound quality is pretty bad, and to activate it you have to painfully press on your earbud twice. Also my main use case is running outside, and the lack of sound permeability is actually dangerous for that.

Meanwhile I tried out the Airpods and am extremely satisfied.

Those have wonderful sound, but they also have a yoke that goes around your neck, with wires connecting to the buds.

So when I heard how good the ""truly wireless"" Jabra Elite 65t's were, I decided I had to try them.

Well, I can testify that they are as good as advertised.

They sound great, look great, fit great.  And they offer a new level of ergonomic polish and convenience.

Initial setup was pretty simple, although it's annoying that Jabra makes you download two apps rather than one.  (One app is Sound +, the primary control app with EQ and options settings; the other is -- um, I don't know, an app that's necessary for reasons I can't explain...)

My first impression of the Elite 65t's sound was that it lacked low-end punch, especially in comparison to the ROC's, which, well, rock. Fortunately, simply by engaging the Bass Boost EQ setting, I ensured that all was again right with the world.

Now the little Jabras sound splendid, with a full bass, detailed mid-range, and crystal highs.  The sound stage is also wide, if not quite as far-reaching as that provided by the ROC's optional 360 mode.

But let's talk about ergonomics.  Take these buds out of the charging case, and they turn on automatically.  Put the first one in your ears, and you'll hear confirmation that it's connected to your device.  Put the second one in, and you'll hear a brief report on the battery charge status.

Similarly, replace the buds in their case, and they shut off automatically.  In addition, any time you open the case, an LED on the outside of the case briefly shows the case's battery charge status, while an LED inside shows the buds' charge status.  Pop a bud out of your ear, and your music pauses automatically until you replace the bud.

The buds supposedly play for five hours on one charge, and the case provides fifteen hours of charge.  That's more than enough for my needs, whether I'm working out at the gym or walking around town.

Then there's the way the 65t's fit -- deep into your ear canals, where they stay put remarkably well, whether I'm working out riding a LifeCycle or striding around briskly doing errands.

They also lie pretty flat in your ears, looking neither like Frankenstein electrodes nor ugly white mucus dripping from your ears like the infamous EarPods.

At the time of this writing, I can't comment on how well these Jabras handle phone calls, as I use them almost exclusively for music listening.  Nevertheless, they have four microphones, two on each side, so they're supposed to pick up your voice very well.

Because of their deep fit in the ears, the Jabras offer quite good passive noise cancellation.  Good enough, in fact, that the manufacturer has a ""pass through"" option you enable with two taps on the right bud, allowing more ambient sound to enter the mix.  I do find this helpful when I'm talking to a store clerk, making it unnecessary to remove either or both buds.

Finally, though these aren't as waterproof as the Active and Sport buds in the Jabra truly wireless range, they do seem to resist sweat quite well -- I haven't had any problems despite working up a good sweat after twenty minutes on the LifeCycle.

The only downside of these Jabras is the price.  They ain't cheap, but they do go on sale from time to time, so if you set a price tracker, you will probably get lucky before too long.

Otherwise the 65t's are music to my ears and likely to yours as well.

PROS:

* Excellent sound (with Bass Boost enabled).
* Superior ergonomics.
* Good looks, secure fit.
* Five hours of battery life in buds, fifteen hours in charger.
* Battery case recharges via USB in two hours or less.

CONS:

* Somewhat pricey, but worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately, they are all true.

1. After a few weeks of use, the earbuds had a hard time connecting with my phone and would just make a staccato noise - in order to fix this, I would have to manually restart the earbuds every time I wanted to use them.
2. I had issues with the connection being extremely inconsistent. I'm an avid cyclist and wanted to use these for my bike rides, but I found them frustrating to use because of the connection issue.
3. The earphone volumes are not balanced. The left side is definitely louder than the right side - this is confirmed by MANY users. Jabra can't seem to updated their firmware to fix this issue (I'm sure they've tried many times)
4. The Jabra app is almost useless (at least on android). It doesn't really offer any special features apart from an EQ selection, but you can do this through most music apps already.
5. Jabra support is incredibly slow in their responses and they just send the same instructions listed in the manual. Jabra finally got back to me and offered to send me a replacement, but by then I was already frustrated with the product and the service.
6. I decided to reach out to Amazon about these issues and they were kind enough to accept a later return (thanks Amazon!)

The only good thing was the sound quality. It's got a great flat response that works well for calls and music. It's not a GREAT sound quality, but it works!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_309?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=309&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Case is a good size, but needs magnetic attachment as I've dropped the case from about coffee table height and had the buds pop out and shoot across the floor.
Hate, hate, hate the microphones. People cannot hear me. I have a Jabra steel headset and have never heard a complaint or anyone ask me to repeat myself in noisy and windy environments, so Jabra knows how to make microphones.

For example:

1. I contacted customer service by completing warranty request form concerning the charging case clasp is broken after only a few months which is still under warranty, no response.
2. The right ear bud has stopped turning off when placed inside charging case, problematic.  The earbud then randomly connects to my iPhone while inside charging case causing me to miss phone calls, unacceptable. Still under warranty.
3. The right earbud doesn’t automatically connect to my iPhone’s bluetooth when removed from charging as it once did, aggravating. Still under warranty.

All of this is aggravating and it is irresponsible for Jabra to not even address my issues.  I have seen that many other customers have address these same issues with NO RESPONSE!

The Jabra Elite 65t, for the price, should be much better and the company should stand behind their product better!

I am keenly aware that losing a single customer is negligible to a huge company in the context of a global market. With customer service being unable or unwilling to resolve my issue, the best I can hope for is to prevent other customers from making the same mistake by posting my experience to every website where this product is sold. This review may be lengthy but I will be as factual as possible.

I purchased the Jabra Elite 65t from the Jabra official web store on 3/29/19 in new, unopened condition. They were shipped by 4/1/19 and I received the item very quickly.

I used the earbuds for about 3 weeks on about 4 occasions for a combined total of 6 hours. I only used the earbuds in an office setting at work. I was happy with the sound quality and several features such as the hearthrough and microphone for calls. Bass was lacking according to my own music tastes, but for such a small driver as well as the true wireless technology I was pleased overall. The Sound+ app was useful and I talked several of my coworkers into purchasing them as well.

The problems began when I needed to charge my earbuds and realized that the notification LEDs on the charging case would not respond. After several hours plugged in and using various cables/charging blocks (including the supplied cable), my earbuds we’re still at 0%. I notified Tech Support on 4/27/19 that my earbuds appeared to be working but the charging case was defective. I received a response quickly the same day and was told to reinstall firmware. I followed the instructions and the problem persisted.

I immediately followed up with Tech Support on 4/27/19 after following their instructions to inform them that my problem was ongoing. I received no further communication from them.

Now outside of the 30-day return window, I contacted Jabra customer service by phone on or around 4/30/19 and restated my problem. The customer service rep seemed disinterested and slightly annoyed but was not overtly disagreeable.

Eventually my case wound up with the warranty department and on 5/2/19 I received an email showing an invoice for a new charger case. While this was an acceptable resolution, I was not informed that the item is currently on backorder. After receiving no further updates since 5/2/19, I contacted customer service by phone on 5/22/19. The customer service rep was polite and finally informed me that they were not expecting my replacement item to be available until the end of June which I find unacceptable.

I asked if there were any other options available to me which would arrive sooner and she suggested a total replacement of all the equipment. The process would require Jabra to send me a shipping label. Afterwards, I would be required to return the equipment and upon verifying receipt, Jabra would send me a new set of the Elite 65ts. Incidentally, this would not only cause me additional inconvenience but would also arrive by the end of June.

I have worked customer service and would never disrespect a representative by raising my voice, cursing, or being generally unpleasant. Realizing that this experience would not end satisfactorily for me, I thanked her for her time and began writing this review.

Overall I was pleased with the earbuds themselves, but a product that cannot charge and therefore does not work is useless to me - thus the reason for my 1-star review. This was my first and last experience with Jabra products. For the price I paid I expected a bit more. Please be aware that if you have any issues with the product it may take months to resolve.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Earbuds connected fine out of the box, but over time would constantly forget the bluetooth connection and have to be re-paired with the device.  Even then, after re-pairing, if you didn't listen to music immediately they would drop the connection within 5 minutes and have to be re-paired.

Attempt to receive support through both Amazon and Jabra has been disappointing, as both basically said to update the software and re-pair the device which I've done multiple times.

I don't love them for this reason in the office because I cannot hear what I need to hear when I'm in the office but that may be something you're looking for so in anycase, they block out extra noise really well.  They almost sound like they plug your ears though, which can be annoying when youre walking and hear every step, if that makes sense.

With that being said.. the hear-thru mode is quite shitty and sounds wonky so I only use these when I want to immerse myself into the music because I don't like how the hear thru mode sounds. (it sounds fake? and maybe every so slightly delayed)

I agree with others when they say that the left one for some reason doesn't stay ini the ear as much as the right ear.  but overall these have great sound and when theyre on and running they are great.  I use them mostly on my commutes, and use my apple airpods in the office.  The airpods are still the winner for convenience and ease of use.  But the sound is better on these (but perhaps because it plugs up your ears so much so that you can't hear anything else?) still good. would recommend regardless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Normally I wouldn't review on fit alone, but others have had this issue.  I've got relatively small ears. Usually the large gels solve any poor fit issues,  but these things are just too heavy for it to matter.

I can't say don't try them,  but definitely have a low threshold for sending them back for not fitting.  Decide before the return window is up.

They work great and I've had no quality issues.  As product design engineer, I will tell you its quite a feat that this team pulled off.  Are there areas to improve - yes! But from every other wireless earbud I've tried these are the best so far.  They do not fall out when running or cycling hard and they are reasonably comfortable.  Everyone has also commented how great my calls have been.  For the next gen I would improve the following if anyone from Jabra is reading this:
1. The snap on the case is a little finiky - needs some improvement here.
2. The left and right buttons are great but the UX is a bit rough.  Can we add swiping rather than a push button.  Pushing a button is hard to do when running and can hurt if you've been wearing these for over an hour.
3. More size ranges of earbud silicone sleeves.  Medium is too loose and Large is a bit too tight.
4. The app needs a little bit of work.  I'd add shortcuts to controls screens. eg. pass-through.

Update: I can't Skip a song on the earbud without upping the volume so I changed this review to 4 stars.  Like I mentioned before the UI needs work.

And Jabra knows better.","Worked well for one day then broke down into static and pops. Resetting didn't help and Amazon finally replaced them, while I also was opening a case with Jabra directly. And then some web searching, and Jabra's comments about mystical magnetic coupling between the buds, turned up that Jabra has known for a long time that any electromagnetic interference can cause this. If you are two feet from a lamp cord or wiring in the wall, or perhaps a Qi charger? They won't work right. Great if you are outdoors or in the car, totally unreliable around AC wiring. And Jabra apparently knows this?!
 Disappointing, especially because once you get them fitting right, they stay in tight and comfortably. Hearing calls in both ears, a great plus.

In addition, they fit comfortably, have excellent connection, and come with different sized tips for people with smaller/bigger ears than normal. They are a solid alternative to the AirPods and have the same features as Apple's product (auto pairing after initial setup, music stops when you take the earbuds out of your ear, etc.).

Pros:
Long batter life, charging case makes it very easy
Cool features, music stops playing when you take an earbud out, wireless controls are a great feature
App is great (much better than bose connect), cool function let's you control EQ
Solid material quality

Cons:
Really bad sound quality,  I mean really bad, tried tweaking the EQ levels but didn't do much
Constant static in left earbud even without the ""hearthrough mode"" function on
Shotty connectivity, often cuttting in and out at times
Painful, the earbuds were hurting the cartiledge in my ears
Not snug for my ears, tried all 3 earbud adapters, still had trouble keeping them in while exercising

Bottom line, the technology isn't there yet.  Has lots of potential with all the cool features but the two most important features for me were sound quality and fit, both of which were very poor.  Had to return this item, going to wait it out another year or so and hope the technology comes around.

So though I can't speak to its experience on a long-term basis, I can say a few thoughts on it so far.

Pros:
1. Good sound in both earbuds. No distortion and fairly balanced.
2. Clear when on the phone with others. I received the feedback that I was easy to understand and they were not even aware when I was driving or walking around.
3. Easy to pair with my phone and use. Sometimes I use one and other times I use both. The right earbud is the primary one with controls, so if you're using one, this would be the one.
4. Good fit in ear. I have never used wireless earbuds before and I had some reservations based on some previous reviews. The package comes with a variety of earbuds to choose from, so it isn't a big deal. I switched out the original one and fit right in. I even got a tattoo for 3 hours the other day and was listening to music the whole time while lying on the table -- no falling out, aches, or itches in my ear as previous reviewers described.

Cons:
1. Not for sports use. The other day I took a brisk walk and it was warm outside. When I began to get sweaty and warm, the fit of the earbud started to change. I would imagine that it is not an ideal choice if you are going out for a run or doing an active sport.
2. Charging case a bit tricky to open. I use my nail but it takes some getting used to.

All in all, well worth the money and I am satisfied :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_364?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=364&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted to buy a headset with noise cancellation, but as I researched headsets I found that noise isolation may work as well at a much lower cost. That lead me to the Jarba Elite Active since they were ranked in almost all of the Best of reviews.

I read the consumer reviews on Amazon and it was about 50/50 between broke immediately and greatest ever so I decided to give it a shot. It took me a couple weeks to get them completely figured out (they have a lot of configuration options) but now that I know things like to insert the left bud first and then the right, don't sit or stand close to high energy electrical components, the left side is volume, forward or back when listening to iTunes, etc., the right side for calls on and on... I think they are everything I hoped they would be. I can ride the train in completed isolation even when the volume is turned down on the music while I am reading or working. I hear nothing!!!

Straight out of the box the right side fit a little tighter than the left, which I can hardly tell is even there, but that is it. I charged them and have been using them trouble free for a month without any unsolvable issues (all fixed through configuration changes). They have never felt like they were going to fall out and they look more like headsets than a piece of jewelry hanging out of my ear. And, I am hearing things in the music that I have never noticed before, and my previous headset was Bose QuietComfort.

The associated app has worked without issue as well. Not much more to say other than I got exactly what I wanted.

1 Year Update:

I couldn't be happier with my choice of ear buds. The Jabra Elite Active have performed day in and day out without issue. I put them on when I start my commute to work and they run for about 4 hours before they tell me the batter is low. It takes about 45 to fully charge in the case before they are good for another 3-1/2 hours or so on the commute home.

No issues with the software or charging case. Dropped one bud while waiting on the train and of course it bounced down onto the railroad tracks. Luckily there wasn't a train so i was able to hop down and retrieve it. Still working fine.

I would not hesitate to buy again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been here for almost a year now and I recently purchased these after losing my Bose Soundsport. Within a week, I experienced static coming from the left earbud at higher volumes. As many people have stated on this page, this is a common problem with the headphones. After a week, I dropped the headphones in the case once. The case still charges, but the earbuds do not pair after pulling out of the case and placing in the ears anymore. I wouldn't even call the drop I had a significant drop as they fell from my waist to the ground. Now the earbuds barely charge and just act ""wonky"". In my honest opinion, I should have just purchased some of the Bose Soundsports again, as they provided me a flawless 6 months of no problems, except for the sticker on the side of the earbuds coming off from use while sleeping.

Since I'm in Afghanistan, in a remote area where we do not have regular mail services, I cannot ship these back.

I will say these were relatively comfortable but besides that I was disappointed with the sounds quality, the craftsmanship, and the reliability of the device. First and last purchase with Jabra unfortunately. Took me $180 to figure it out, oh well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At the two month mark the left earphones sound dropped to about 25% of the right ear. I contacted Jabra and they told me to do a reset and reinstall the update. I did both, to no avail. The headphones are now unusable. I have heard nothing more from Jabra. I am very disappointed with their customer service. I am a bit of a wireless headphone addict and have several pairs. I have had headphones from Senso and Jaybird. Both companies, within a week had immediately replaced the defective headphones. I didn’t even have to send the defective headphones back. I guess some companies are better than others. I won’t purchase anything else from Jabra if this is the way they back their products. $170 headphones that lasted 2 months...
Update: I finally got through to Jabra.  Their answer is to return the product to where it was purchased and get a refund or replacement.  So....  They pass the buck and don't seem willing to back their products.

The noise cancellation is great 👌🏽 Can’t hear anybody or other noise during my workout, but when I recently updated it, there was a new feature added where IF I paused my music, the headphones would open up and pick up noise around me, but then when I would play my music, the noise cancellation would activate. It’s pretty convenient, especially when you know many people at the gym and you find yourself talking to a lot of people.

The bass is very good, but it’s only good when the volume is high. Again, I don’t like to blast my music because these headphones are really good at noise cancellation, so when you blast these high, they hurt your ears 👂. There’s an app where you can control the sound of the music, which is a great tool when you want to go all out on bass or go high on treble.

These earbuds have a great function where IF one or both of the headphones fall out, your music is paused.... BUT if they had a secured fit, then this wouldn’t happen.... 🤔 so it is a useful function, but it foreshadows something that every hardcore, intense fitness man or woman hates more than injuries.... which is headphones FALLING OUT OF YOUR EARS!! 😤🤬🤬

If you’re intense like me, and love to do any form of HIIT Cardio, jump rope, sprinting, etc., then you most definitely hate it when headphones fall out. Well, these headphones do just that. At first, they stay in your ear, but once you start to sweat, these headphones pop right out of your ears. 😤
In fact, the right earbud just fell as I was typing this sentence. These earbuds fall out when you eat as well.

To sum these headphones up, they’re great for:
1.) Low Intensity Cardio or Steady State Cardio
2.) Most Resistance Training workouts
3.) Weighted Calisthenics

This is NOT for:
1.) Athletes
2.) HIIT Cardio
3.) Listening to music while eating
4.) Anything that requires High Intensity movements

Crap, the right earbud fell again while I was eating and adding a headline for this product 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️

Pairing to my phone was fairly easy and the fit and finish of these earbuds and the case was very much to my liking.  They hold up in the ear to treadmill runs and sweat, without them coming close to falling out of my ears.

Sadly, I noticed almost immediately that the left earbud was noticeably louder than the right, creating a very distracting imbalance (think the left being at 100% volume and the right being about 70%.)  Adjustments proved useless, and I had to send my first pair back and request a new pair.  I'll update my review after the replacements come.

*8/29 Update*

With my replacement I find that the audio is finally balanced decently between the left and right earbuds, and with no connection issues to speak of, I am pretty satisfied with these earbuds.

I kept having the same issues with the left ear bud overpowering the right ear bud and creating an imbalance to the left side when watching any videos on You Tube, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime and when listening to podcasts.  The only time they weren't grossly imbalanced was when I was listening to music.  I tried factory reset, language resets and firmware updates.  Nothing fixed the problem!!  When I called Jabra Customer Support, I would wait no less than 30 minutes and when I did finally get to talk to someone they would act like what I was experiencing was an anamoly.  I have given up on Jabra and moved on.  I purchased a pair of $50 Jbuds.

But I own other Jabra headsets that I like quite a bit, so I finally purchased a pair, and I have to say that I am completely delighted with these earbuds!  I've been using them for about a month in a variety of situations: biking, working out, on a plane, in the car, on conference calls, and they are easily the best wireless headset/earbuds that I have owned.  Great fit in my ear, easy to connect and use, really good sound, and despite what others have said the phone app is pretty straight forward and easy to use.  But here is the best part, in the month that I have been using these, the earbuds have NEVER lost their connection with the phone, and I have never had any skips while playing music (using with an iPhone 7).  And as others have mentioned, this is the first headset I have used for calls where I don't always have the volume on maximum because they are plenty loud.

I tried them out for the first time today and had nothing but issues with how they fit. The medium size ear tip fit me the best but if you cant get the earbuds to sit perfectly in your ear the sound is either muffled or completely cut off. The problem is the sound tube that goes in to your ear is extremely small if this tube isnt straight in to your ear and is off to an angle then the sound gets muffled. While i was working out the earbuds would slightly adjust in my ear from the sweat/movement so i was constantly trying to re adjust the earbuds so i can hear my music properly. I ended up taking them out and not using them half way through my work out.

On the plus side they were very comfortable and the sound was pretty good but this design flaw makes them unusable for me","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First and foremost these barely fit my ears. These earbuds rely heavily on the shape of your ears, and while I can get them in they hurt A LOT at first and even after a week I find it hard to keep them in more than a few hours and after my ears are sore.

As for everything else its great, but nothing mindblowing. What everyone says about volume is true, and often I need it at max to feel like im getting meaty sound and sometimes i wish it could get even louder. The mono for your right ear is convenient, but incredibly inconvenient when it won't do the same for the left ear or even connect with just the left ear.

My only other gripe is that the earbuds self determine when they are in your ear, and at least once a day they cut in and out like I took it out of my ear for no reason and will randomly stutter.

While these feel good for a truly wireless earbud they are also my first and its been a earache and a headache. I can't solidly reccomend these because they rely heavily on your ear shape to work and if my ears were any narrower these would be unusable. If you can somehoe find out if they fit your ears before buying then its a great product but otherwise you are rolling the dice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem for me is I can't get them to stay in my ears.

If you get absolutely any moisture from sweat,  they will start to slide and you'll spend more time with your hands trying to push them back in than actually enjoying them being wireless.

The sound quality I'd rate as above average.
 I could do without the frequent audio drop outs while listening to music.
The noise cancelling isn't bad, never any issues with calls.

All in all i'd say they are good for leisure, if you plan on doing any kind of activity with a lot of movement,  be prepared to catch them and be annoyed as they slide out every 20 seconds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_283?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=283&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Their support was actually very helpful and easy to work with, so I'm hoping my issues can be resolved soon.

Pros: good sound quality.
Cons: everything else. This is a broken product which doesn’t work as advertised. The buds cannot detect that they have been removed from the case, so after putting in your ear you have to press the button on the right side to turn them on which isn’t painful but certainly not comfortable. You would think the left bud would turn on when you turn on the right, but no, then you have to repeat the process for the left bud. Same issue when putting them back in the case. The light blinks but they stay on, unable to detect they’ve been put away until they drain your battery completely. They’re also very slow to connect to Bluetooth so turning them on is a real mission.

Sometimes they disconnect after the end of a call. Sometimes they randomly activate the pass through feature (to hear outside sounds) and it can’t be deactivated until turning them off and back on.

They are advertised to be able to connect to multiple devices at once, but as soon as you connect a second device the first one stops working and has to be re-paired.

Firmware updates don’t work either, if you try the device just blinks purple incessantly for hours until the battery drains, meanwhile you can’t use them all day.

I’m sure most other products out there have similar issues, but they also don’t cost almost 200 dollars and aren’t advertised as a premium product. If you’re shelling out that kind of money and especially if you have an iPhone do yourself a favor and buy EarPods for the same price as these, they aren’t as good on sound quality and isolation, but on a day to day basis they won’t be the cause of constant frustration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cons:

Uncomfortable - They feel bad in the ear.  Their shape is odd and that may be why they do not feel good in the ear.

Noise Leakage - They do not block much incoming noise. You really have to crank up the volume and jam them into your ears to block out any external sounds.

Lack of controls - You can't put yourself on mute when you are on a phone call, you have to use your phone to take yourself on and off of mute.  There are no controls for fast forward/ next song or rewind function.  The only controls are volume up and volume down.

Hear Through Function - it double tap the right bud and it is supposed to allow more of the sound in your environment in. It only works if you choose to mute your music.

The app - clunky, does not do much, and when you change the equalizer there is significant lag between making the change and hearing the change.

Pros:

Easy to pair.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They fail badly at phone calls, returned the first set as I thought they were defective, they were not. I can through hear them just fine with one or both earbuds in but it picks up every single sound other than my voice!! even when I am not near noisy are but wind, babies and virtually any and all outside noises can be heard on the other end. No reviews talk about this aspect and I did not want to carry multiple wired and wireless earpieces.
They are not good for cycling as there is a lot of wind noises no matter what the fit is, Using the Hear Thru makes it worse of course. they are good for walks, the gym, and indoors they sound the best, They dont fall out, I only press them in a bit over time but not an issues with fit or comfort and I use large tips. The block sound fairly well but not like my custom fitting wired ones. You can hear outside by either the app or double tap the right bud and that works well but is very hissy so can grate on your nerves after a while but easy to jump back and forth, you can hear cars well walking but wont ever use them for cycling ..too much wind noise for music and they cannot hear you either!!
The good parts are they connect to multiple phones, watches etc easily and distance is good from the phone, less good on a Gamin 5x Plus, but that's most likely the watch bluetooth poor being  too low.
Battery life seems good and have yet to go empty after 3-4 hours of movies on planes and using them for Google maps while walking and driving. the Case fits in your pocket and realize you will always need to carry one due to losing them and charging them, mostly you would lose or ruin them in your pocket without the case.
 The controls are ok to use once you read  directions and realize the right and left do different things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, if you do plan to, look else where.  The microphone in this product will amplify quiet noises if you are not speaking and will send a massive amount of feedback to the person on the other line.  I tested this myself (as I purchased it for my mother to take meetings on) and when I was talking on the other line the earbud's mic (currently being used by my mother) would pick up on my voice and send it back essentially creating an echo effect.

First and foremost, it does produce great sound (not amazing, but great). As many will mention, if you are looking for bass and treble, this is not for you. However, the mid's and high's are great for this price. The volume does not max out too much which is good so you do not get deaf. I do not use Alexa or Siri, but the functions would come in handy. I needed headphones that I can take to work out and use at work. I like how it comes with a case that is able to recharge the headphones. What I do not like is the battery like of five hours, but it is a small set so it is understandable that's why it only lasts that long. Make sure that you get the Java Sound Plus app to be able to control other functions such as finding the device, control the equalizer, and motion sensors. The headset does an okay job of blocking out outside noises. There is a function that you can hear the environment for when you are exercising outside and you hear cars or your just your surroundings. However, I do not need that function. I tried doing a few HIIT exercises and it stays secure in my ears. I had to use the ear set that it arrived in, but it does have smaller or larger options. I found that the default (medium) was perfect for blocking out sound and maintaining the sound quality that I wanted. It is definitely a great investment.

Within a week I noticed a sound imbalance where the volume of the right ear bud is much lower than the left. I spent hours trying fixes, including factory reset, not using the app, using different tips, and nothing. I googled it and found a whole Reddit thread on the issue and no solution from Jabra.  I contacted Jabra and they emailed me a fix, that if you try twice, you can return or ask for a new pair. I just received the new pair and the same problem exists.

-the ability to turn on/off noise canceling is very nice. This feature uses the microphone to actually push through the ambient audio.
-Feel within ear--this works well and feels snug in my ear. It does not stress my ear to use these for long periods of time
-Audio quality is great
-Battery life is acceptable. Around 4 hours
-It connects quickly and easily to multiple devices

Cons:
-The case is very difficult to open. I have multiple times pushed hard to open the top of the case where the force to open makes the buds fall to the ground.
-You can only use the right bud solo. You are unable to use the left bud without also having the right bud in place.
-you cannot share buds with someone to watch a show together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_329?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=329&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No complaints there (except for the earphone tips), but my main gripe is the software part of the headphones.

The hearthrough feature is a great addition and is able to pick up a variety of sounds around your environment. But it sounds like your hearing the world through a fishbowl at a pretty low volume.

Alexa enabled, this feature was something that I was surprised and excited for, but it's far from perfect. When you say a command, it responds pretty accurately but the last few words cut off leaving you wondering if your whole command went through.

A cool feature that Jabra didn't say they had was independent music playing with Alexa. I have not gotten it to work on the headphones themselves but if you have a Echo, you can command them to play your selected music on your headphones and it will work seamlessly.

I hope they fix these issues in future updates, because for their size these are a great pair of headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I always buy Bose products but I lost my previous Bose buds so opted to try something new.

1. They do not fit easily in ear or remain in the ear canal. I changed to the smaller size but they still managed to get loose and fall out of my ears more than once!

2. I downloaded the App and wasnt too happy about the app settings. The only good thing is the Hear Through option.

3. I could not get my music to play through my headphones for a long time even though my Amazon music app said I was connected to Jabra headphones. only calls would come through.  After a few test calls and messing with the apps (Amazon music and Jabra) I finally got the music to play via headphones.

4. When I took the headphones off and disconnect the device from my phone, the Amazon Music App would not shut off. It wouldn't play the music on the speakers either. The music would come out sounding like the audio on a call without speaker phone. I exited the app many times and the music kept playing. I'm sure it had something to do with Jabra headphones since I've never experienced it before.

5. I spent so my time trying to get my headphones to work, I hardly got to enjoy them. I canceled /refunded my purchase within hours because it should not be sp difficult.  I think I'll go back to Bose products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tend to want to fallout, especially with some sweat.

However, the sound is tinny and thin, no matter how much I jack up the volume and the equalizer. Did I get a defective one?

During phone calls on sidewalks (as moderate traffic went by) I’ve found it hard to hear what the other person was saying and been asked whether I was standing in a toilet because of background “swishing” sound. So: fine in an office or home gym; but not what the reviews had led me to expect – and not an upgrade over my $50 Avantree Joggers.

***

After more time with these I’m amazed by how poorly/inconsistently they pair with my iPhone. They regularly drop pairing in the middle of a workout or don’t establish it at the beginning. A second paired device leads to the headphones cycling between being paired and unpaired. I spend an inordinate amount of time restarting them or my phone to try to reset the connection.

Jabra has made earbuds for phones since I was a kid, my dad loved this brand so it was easy for me to depart from apple and get these. The design is awesome, over the phone people can hear me, they just didn’t stand the test of time which when you spend this much you def want the to last longer than a month in a half.

- Great fit. I have been using them in the gym and rarely if ever felt the need to adjust. On the other hand when I used Samsung IconX I constantly felt it was going to fall out.
- Easy to pair, and works well both with my phone (Galaxy S8) and my laptop (Macbook). IconX cannot be connected to Macbook thanks to Apple and Samsung war.
- Good sound quality both for music and call.
- Some useful features in the app like controlling hear through and equalizer.

Cons:
- I am on my second pair and both times the left earphone produced some static. That was surprising and not something I would expect from these relatively expensive earphones. I will be returning and ordering the Active hoping that I was just unlucky these two times. This is the reason for a 2-star review.
- The left earphone sometimes just doesn't connect/turn on. Easily solved by pressing and holding the reduce volume button but it'll be better if this didn't happen.
- Minor: the charging indicator blinks when fully charged. If you leave it charging at night, you have a mini disco ball in a dark room. This can be fixed with a firmware update but I am not sure many people share this pet peeve.
- Minor: USB-C would have been better since that's what the current standard is but I can deal with the fiddly micro USB for now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Initially, I felt a slight discomfort in my ears for about hour and half use everyday. Then it started to irritate my ears badly which took me to the urgent care next day.

I was paranoid to use earphones when I workout but it really took great time to get rid of that. This product is totally worthless for the cost, the sound quality is poor and other features aren't really needed if it is meant for activity tracking. I have smartwatches for that purpose as it is always on me.

All I wanted is a quality sound when i workout. When there are many other products with best sound quality out there in the market why this one? Wrongly decided.

The instant connection and smart features like pausing when you remove one of them and the 'hear through' are great. I considered several of these types of earbuds and it came down to a very expensive, but very high-quality set, the 'original' wireless buds (orange ya glad I didn't say A----?) :) Both of those others are amazing in their own rights, but the factors that tilted me toward the Jabra are:
 - Noise Isolation - I like the 'earplug' quiet that I can enjoy. There are times I want to hear the world around me, other times I want to shut it out.
 - Hear Through - for the times I want to be more aware of the world, I double-tap the right bud and the mics pick up outside sounds and transmit it to me. It does sound a bit tinny (think mid-quality hearing aids) but it's certainly nice to to have the option to block or allow outside sounds into your world.
 - Controls built in to the buds - this means they're a bit larger, but not nearly as large as the really premium ones I was looking at (BTW, I have the noise-cancelling, wired earbud versions and they truly are amazing - size and price put these ahead of those better-sounding ones). I like having the buttons so I don't have to rely on Siri or pull the phone out of my bag/pack/holster while hiking to change volume, etc.

So those little white buds or those big ones with the amazing sound are great, just didn't quite hit all the points that were important to me.

So why not 5 stars? The case. While it's great to charge them, there are two issues I have with it:
 - The lid is VERY easy to pop open. I leave the case in a small cubby in the car dash and many times I find the case has popped open and the earbuds are rattling around in the storage space.
 - It's awkward to clean them - if you don't immediately wipe off the eartips before putting them in the case, you're going to have some waxy buildup in the case (one thing the little white buds are MUCH better for).

So - there you have it, great sound - very convenient and NO CORDS. I hate the cord dragging across my chin and transmitting all that sound right into my ears. These are amazing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_342?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=342&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Other reviewers noted the master connection is to the right headphone, so if you put your phone in your left pocket it tends to drop audio in sync with your movement.  This problem gets very annoying when you are on a call and you can't hear the other side.  It sounds like you're on a very old VOIP connection.  When I open the fridge, something with the fridge interferes with them and the audio drops completely until I close the door.  Someone walks by me on the street and the audio drops.  Or in a park with nothing around.

I figured the majority of reviews were positive so I took the risk of buying these and ignoring the few negative reviews which sounded a lot like mine.  The physical design is well thought out and not very noticeable, but the whole package is not good.  Something in the bluetooth is very wrong for certain owners like myself, and being in a noisy wireless environment prohibits using these where other headphones do not struggle.  I don't like airpods, they don't provide any sound isolation, but the obvious comparison here is that these sound issues never occur with airpods.  Same for most other bluetooth headsets like Jaybird, even the cheap Anker set that was 1/8 the price of these never drops audio when I walk around.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As I'm walking around I might get an audio desync for a fraction of a second but it instantly resolves itself and is rare enough that I can't say how often it really happens. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for reliable true wireless earbuds.

Edit: So my left earbud had an issue that required it to be replaced under warranty. Jabra's CS is pretty awful.  While they accepted the issue and replaced it without too much problem I had to call them 4 or 5 times during the process, giving multiple days (or a week) between things and every time no progress had been made until the call. The 2nd time I called after a few days of waiting to find the status I was informed the buds had to be returned and that the first rep told me this. He hadn't and the rep I was then talking to then made a return label and emailed it to me. Each call after that was essentially basically the same, ""What's the status of the claim?"" ""No change, but now that you've called we'll put it into the queue for the next step which will take a few days."" Each call was a 20-40 minute wait on hold and the whole process took about a month.

I lost my trusty corded Air Earbuds (I know... I know...) and needed / wanted something better in lots of aspects. But I was skeptical of AirPods so looked up alternatives.

Initially when I came across the Jabra Elite 65t I was impressed by the coverage. Wirecutter is a go to for me so I bought them to give it a shot. The 65t regular are solid but then I read more about the active series. That’s what I’m reviewing.

And holy crap... these are so impressive. Packaging for both products is the same but the device itself is way more than marginally better. The finish on the active model of the elite 65t immediately stood out. Looked like a higher quality build and the copper is slick. And then I touched the ear bud. It’s was noticeably more pleasant than the Elite 65t. So I popped into my ear. I’m not kidding when I say that it’s genuinely like they aren’t even there. They are insanely comfortable. The Elite 65t needed some twisting around in my ear to get to the perfect spot and depth but the grip and comfort of the Elite Active 65t was just instantly comfortable. If taken in and out a few times and never more than a small rotation of the mic arm to be perfect fit.

The sound quality is superb. The HearThrough feature is excellent. Just mainly wanted to highlight fit, comfort and design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did purchase foam tips and used then for a while, but ultimately decided to use without the foam tips.  I use them for running and for general music listening and phone calls.  They stay in my ears with no problems during runs.  These would stay during pretty intense excercise.  They are comfortable and sound great.

The battery life has been really nice...I've had no challenges in long flights.  The case works really nicely and can charge the headphones.  It still uses micro-usb....would be nice to get this in usb-c.

They did a nice job with the app and provide several different profiles for sound and various settings.  One of the best features is to enable the hear through mode where you can hear ambient noise around you.  This is useful to be able to hear cars when you are on a run.

I use these both with my Galaxy s9+ and my work iPhone.  Neither phone has issues connecting.  All the controls work.

These work great for phone calls also.  Wind noise is amplified a bit....as per people I have spoken with.

All in all - I am very pleased with my purchase.  They sound great, have great battery life, stay in your ears, are comfortable, have a lot of useful features....and....don't make you look like an idiot with white rods sticking down from your ears.

Only time I switch to using my handset is when there is a lot of background noise - walking through airport, in train, etc.  Otherwise they are great.  They don't do a very good job of noise cancellation but that's probably because the mic is so far from your mouth.  I actually have two pair - Active and Standard - Don't really have a preference for one over the other.  Keep one with my keys and every day carry stuff and keep one on my desktop (see pic).  Leaving it plugged in and open works fine.  It disconnects from Bluetooth when dropped back in the case.  Answers a call when I remove from the case.  Would love a machined or molded stand with some weight to it but my home-brew stand works for now...  Only improvements I would prefer is a little better latching mechanism (feel like the plastic latch will wear out) and wish the buds were magnetically retained.

I mainly bought these for the gym, but am finding myself using them around the house too. The freedom of true wireless buds is a big plus to me. For wireless ""buds"", these have very nice sound quality. They connect right as you remove them from the case. Sometimes you have to manually connect them if you have a 2 or more devices with bluetooth turned on. They look much more attractive than those white Apple earbuds too. As long as you monitor the battery life of your case, you almost never have to worry about battery life. My old headphones would always surprise me mid-workout by dying, leaving me with no music or podcasts for the duration of my workout. These never to that. I would give them a try if they are within your budget.

Fit is customizable and comfortable - plus I don’t look like a total geek in public like Apple and Bose. No Bluetooth connectivity hiccups experienced. Really love the “hear through” features on call mode and audio mode. Carrying case is small and is easy to use.

So, I’ve tried a lot of Bluetooth headsets. I have not tried the expensive and easy to lose Apple buds, which I am sure are OK, but look funny to me with the white sticks coming out if the ear like you’ve got a childhood ear infection all over again.

Anyways, I jumped on the chance to check out these awesomely great Jabra buds and am super happy with them. I also own a Jabra 75 over the ear headphone with boom mic that is my indispensable set for sitting at my office desk, so it was not a shock that Jabri could do it again in bud form.

Pros:
1. Snug fit in the ear with included sets of ear cushion inserts. They stay out and block sound in a way the Apple design can’t.
2. Sound: it’s just great, including the bass. I like listening to music in these. It’s very good, not just tolerable.
3. Mic quality is excellent according to my coworkers who I talk with. I spend hours a day on phone calls and I have to talk as well as listen. These keep me understood
4. Battery life is five hours. I’ve run them down and believe the 5 hour claim is conservative.
5. Compact charger case. This is an awesome tool. It has micro usb as it’s charger port, so it is easy to charge the charger. Top: don’t try to open it by slipping your fingernail into the front crack of the case. Grab it by the side edged instead. Easier.
6. Looks unobtrusive compared to white drainage stick.
7. Setup was easy, although I did need to look at the instructions because you have to pair both sides the first time.
8. App: the app is useful. Change the equalizer without going to settings. Yay!
9. Don’t have to turn them on and off. Putting them in the case puts them in standby. Also can pause songs by taking them out of your ear.
10. Controls are accessible by adult human hands.
11. Supports iPhone control set for earphone remote.

I could go on. All said, these are not cheap, but they are durable pro gear that I use every day. Sturdy, practical. Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a pair of Doppler Labs Here One buds that had a lot of promise but failed miserably with everyday use. Way too complicated to use and pair and they dropped the signal all the time. I'll note I've not tried Apple's AirPods, however, the wired counterpart tend to fall out of my ears, so I haven't been excited to try them.

Enter these Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds. They came in a cute little rechargeable storage case (but overly large cardboard product box) and easily charge via Micro USB (a cable but no AC charger is included.) There are three ear gel sizes to choose from, the medium work well for my ears. After inserting the earbuds deeply into my ears (using the pull the top of the ear trick; learned from fitting earplugs), I've got a good seal and they are unlikely to fall out under any ""active"" activity (mostly walking for me; I'm not a runner, but I did simulate by shaking my head). I wish that spare ear gels would be included in the package, however. I might be on the lookout for some other styles that provide more isolation (I'd say the included ones have average passive isolation); I imagine Jabra and or other vendors will soon follow in the marketplace. They have been plenty comfortable in my ear for a couple hours at a time.

Pairing was easy with my iPhone 8. You can pair using the native Bluetooth functionality in iOS and then use the Jabra Sound+ app to customize your sound ""signature"", the hear-through function, among a few other features. The full user manual is also conveniently located in the app (just a quick start paper guide is included in the box.) Firmware upgrades are also easily handled through the app.

The sound quality -- well, they're wireless and small. No huge bass but totally passable and reasonable mids and treble. Make sure you fit them as deep in your ear as reasonably possible for the best sound quality. I can count the number of bluetooth drops with the phone in my pocket on one hand -- and the majority of those happened when a NYC subway pulled into the station (perhaps bluetooth interference from a mass of train passengers or simply the metallic cars) causing a very brief disruption. Otherwise, I can roam around my small 600 sq ft apartment and the signal only drops at the far edges of my place. When making phone calls, the other parties had no difficulty hearing me, but when outside, the wind noise was noticeable but did not make phone calls impossible.

Controlling your music and volume with the right taps and pushes on the earpieces takes a little getting used to but quickly becomes second nature, unlike the Here One earbuds I used previously. The commands on my phone were immediately received and processed accurately. Charging the buds in the case is easy. I haven't reached the max 5 hour battery life before putting them back in the case (the case holds two additional charges.) There's an easy to see green light on the charging case to confirm it has power.

These are an absolute keeper and I'd say that truly wireless earbud technology is finally maturing. I imagine we will see more and more of these come out in the next few years as the headphone jack goes the way of the dodo. I use Jabra office headsets at work and have always been impressed. Surprisingly, a two year warranty is included like those. Always thought Jabra/GN Netcom was an also-ran in the consumer space, but these earbuds prove that's untrue and if the quality remains, they've got a good product lineup ahead for consumers that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Background: I'm a runner and have been looking to have good bluetooth earbuds to use while running as well as when i'm on the go.  Having the ability to listen to music as well as take the occasional call while running through the airport would be great.

Pros:
* Nice small compact earbuds that has a relatively nice charge.
* Only done some limited activity (cardio) so far but the earbuds have stayed in the ear.  I sweat a lot from the head so earbuds would always fall out during exercise.
* Love the ability to control a lot of things from the earbuds.
* HearThrough works pretty well.
* Paring is seamless and painless.  They connect to the phone pretty quickly and don't have any issues (yet) with the earbuds connecting to each other.

Cons:
* Voice commands via Alexa ability isn't enabled yet.  Siri works fine.
* The app could be more refined as there was a registration issue (fixed today) and sometimes the app will cause the ear buds to disconnect for some reason.
* Earbuds seem to hurt my ears a little after wearing them for more than an hour.  I am debating on whether I should get Comply Foam Tips to resolve this issue.
* Buttons can be painful to press -- feels like you're jamming the buds into your ear.
* Base seems to be lacking but you can modify it via the music equalizer in the app.

Update 6/11: Got the Comply Foam Tips (the sports kind) but they don't really fit well on these ear buds.  I ended up reverting back to the original tips and it's actually been fine.  My ears have adjusted to them I guess.  I'm using them to and from commutes as well as my workouts with no issues.  Haven't been really using the buttons much yet though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality and loudness potential is far greater than either of the jabra pulse models, or jaybird 3, which are the earbuds I've been using until now. I use these when running, and at my desk, listening usually for 1-3 hours at a time. I put them back in the case when I'm not using them, and I end up having more than enough charge for a whole week of listening! They are very good at blocking noise, much like on-ear gel earplugs. The app allows for ambient sound to play back at a diminished volume, which is a little surreal, and feels like I'm living inside of a conference call.. but it's useful sometimes. I must say, this is the most satisfied I've ever been with earbuds! I've spent a lot more money on other models and brands, usually with sexier marketing, or popular appeal, only to be underwhelmed or disappointed with quality or unnecessary features.

Note: These may not fit small ears particularly well. Also, I don't use Alexa for anything, so I can't vouch for that feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality:  A+ Great bass and highs

Battery:  Got a full 5 hours, paused for another 15 minutes to charge and they lasted the rest of my day.
Case: Fantastic!  fits right in my pocket.. SQUEEZE on the side to open.  Thankfully, I viewed a YouTube post to learn this.
Only complaint:  the manual is extremely small. A quick online search will teach you much more.

The only downside is that they are Mp3 players only so I decided to get some ear buds.  After researching my needs/wants I selected these and my biggest concern was battery life. and how they stay in your ear.

I've had them for a few days now and today I decided to test out the battery life.  I put them on at 6:00am and had music streaming and it only stopped when/if I received a phone call.  At 11:30am I got the first notification that the battery was low.  Yes! 5 1/2 hours of constant use.  I then wore them another 30 minutes before they died but I was very happy to know I can use them that long non-stop.

As for how they stay in your ear, you just put them in one way and then slightly twist them and they basically lock in.  Sounds odd but it works and they stay in great.

The only downside for me is that my ears start hurting after about an hour of use but I got used to it a little.  When I took them out it's as if my ears were like ""ABOUT TIME."" :)  I think that is just my not being used to wearing ear buds.

Overall I am VERY happy and think they are amazing works of art. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Anyways, on to regular reviewing.

Pros:
-Sound is good for the price point
-Stay in pretty decently for not having any positive retention like Jaybirds or Bose Soundsports
-App is fairly intuitive and opens automatically when taking ear buds out of the case (necessary for eq to work and passthrough)
-Alexa integration worked

Cons:
-Tip fell off. Already. In my ear. This is the entire reason I hate in-ear headphones because it's always at a really inconvenient time [to find someone/a way to extract it]
-The buttons suck. Feels like I'm mashing the buds into my ear to get anything to work

Used the size that fit me best but still was far from ideal, I really had to initially pull down on the earlobe, place the buds deem into the canal, and have them stay in that way (which is the proper wearing technique). About a week later, they’re fantastic! ‘Molded’ to my ear shape and I found the angle I like. That was perhaps the only downside I’ve ever experienced with this thing, apart from YouTube videos with a standard viewing account not automatically resuming play after taking one earbud out (though I figure that’s more a YT software issue than the Jabras). Everything else is great, the case isn’t nearly as problematic as most reviews make it out to be and the battery life is really solid. Pressing the tactile buttons may at first seem discomforting, but within a few days becomes pleasing and functional. A really well rounded product and much more solid than Oral B’s AirPods (I’ve tried both).

Ever since wireless and true-wireless earbuds were invented, I've had to admire them from afar ... I'm an adult, but I have small ears. Earbuds just don't want to stay in my ears (unless they have the little hook/wings to keep them in.)

But after reading so many reviews of people SWEARING they stay in, and after watching Jabra's video ad (asking the viewer to shake their phone so the model shakes his head from side to side, showing that the earbuds don't fall out,) I decided to try once more. Once again, I was disappointed. They just won't stay in.

YES, I used the small-sized pads.

YES, I read the instructions on how to twist & turn them into position.

YES, I applied gentle pressure to insert them into the ear canal while turning.

And, yes ... they still fall out.

Sure, there were a couple of times they would rest gently in my ears, but as soon as I started normal activity (walking briskly, etc,) they'd fall out. I had to keep pushing deep into my ears to force them to stay. I felt like I needed a degree in anthropometry and ergonomics just to figure out the right way to make them stay. Using earbuds shouldn't be this difficult.

For those super-humans with the perfect ears (who apparently Jabra designed these for,) enjoy them!

But, for the rest of us sub-standard humans with aural deformities not worthy of such luxuries as this, move along ... There's nothing to see here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1 Sound is acceptable. Not as good as my H800 but acceptable.
2 Charging case is nice and I like the way it secures and can only be opened by pressing the sides.
3. reasonably comfortable. Although extended wear may change my mind.
4. For travel I do on a plane, it works well with my phone and I am looking forward to that.

Why it fails:
1. The big reason for this was the multi connect capabilities. Using it to listen to music on the computer and meetings and have it auto switch to phone for calls. It doesn't do this well. I was on a phone call and it kept repeating 2 devices connected/disconnected during my call. I don't think the other person heard it, but it repeated it over and over. Terrible. I finally had to turn off the bluetooth on the computer to make it stop.

Consequently, I will not use it to replace my Jabra Supreme for phone calls and it is absurd that I need to carry two devices.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them mostly with an Android phone and bought them after a lot of research looking at all the truly wireless earbuds in this price range.  I had narrowed it down to these versus Apple Airpods and ultimately got these for better Android integration and a better deal on a ""used"" pair from Amazon Warehouse.  (They didn't appear to be used at all.  Probably just a previous customer return that someone decided not to keep.)

They paired easily right out of the box.  I'm not an audiophile, so not as discriminating as some people, but I think they sound excellent.  I'm used to using wired earbuds and find when they seal in the ear canal, they are capable of delivering full, rich sound.  The medium ear gels are the only ones that fit me, but at least they give you a set of small and large in case they don't.  They do get tiring after about an hour or so of use.  Mostly because your ear canal is supporting all the weight of the earbuds.  Although they aren't heavy, they are heavier than wired earbuds, which I can wear for hours without even noticing them.

I've had no video sync issues with YouTube or Plex, my two most-used video apps, which was my biggest concern about truly wireless earbuds after reading all the reviews.

I can't give these a 5-star review for a couple of specific reasons.  First, these things are really, really slippery.  The plastic they are made of is just way too smooth and they too easily slip out of my fingers when I'm trying to put them in my ears or put them back in their case.  There's no way to get them to emit any sound to find it if it's lost, so I could see this being a big problem if they are dropped in a public place like an airplane.

Second, the case is horribly designed.  Like the ear buds, the plastic is really smooth and hard to grip.  The case should take zero thought to open, but the first time I tried to open it, I had to fiddle around with it for at least a minute to figure out exactly how it worked.  It is really difficult to open in the dark since there's no way to tell front from back by touch.  Sticking your fingernail or thumbnail in the little slit does nothing to help you open the case.  It's easiest to open by pushing the lid inward as with one thumb as you are squeezing the sides of the base with your other thumb and index finger to get the latch to release.  Sound complicated?  The fact that I had to type all that out in the first place just to explain it proves there is a flaw in the design.  The latch and lid feel really flimsy and I'm really doubtful it's going to last very long before it stops latching.

All that said, I'm satisfied with them.  I'm admittedly anti-Apple, so I was relieved that I didn't have to buy Airpods to get a good set of truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds.

Edit after 1 month of use:
These are more like a 3.5 than a 4.  I'm still having issues with how slippery they are but have gotten more used to them.  I'm constantly afraid I'm going to lose one when using them out in public.

I dislike the case even more now that I've been using it a few weeks.  I use these almost exclusively at night before going to bed and it's a challenge to put them in their case in the dark.  It's possible, but just way harder than it should be because they have to go in the case just-so or you can't close it.  Combined with how slippery they are, it always takes longer than it should.

I like the HearThrough feature that lets you hear ambient noise while wearing the earbuds, but with my Google Pixel, HearThrough cuts in and out with my right ear bud constantly if no media is playing.  I haven't heard anything from Jabra e-mail support after report it to them,  This alone may make me decide to return them to Amazon before the window closes because I don't know if mine are defective or if it's a known issue.

The fit has been great for my ears.  They feel really secure once they are in and can wear them for hours without noticing them.  If I decide to keep them, this will be the main reason why.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_347?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=347&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Today is my first day using them for my routine workweek and I'm not satisfied. See below:
1) It takes a few seconds and sometimes minutes for the app to acknowledge it is connected to your phone. So switching between presets can be annoying. I've also noticed the app dropping out connectivity at times when changing through presets.
2) I left the office for a walk and tried making a phone call outdoors. The person on the other end had a hard time hearing me because of some slight wind. Also, connectivity got worse when I put my phone in my pants pocket (this stayed true while I was indoors as well). However, this was extremely annoying.
3) Went to the gym this morning and I commonly jump around machines. I must have walked only 20 feet away and the connection became staticy and it was very annoying.
4) Every now and then, there is a routine static that you hear every few seconds. I think it goes away eventually but why is it there in the first place?
The good:
1) They do fit well in your ear. I ended up using the larger earpiece in my right ear and the medium size in my left. Used them while lifting weights this morning and no problems staying in the ear.
2) The hear through option is taking me a little bit to get accustomed to but I do see the value in it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_275?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=275&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Worse still, after sending them back to Jabra, they denied the warranty because they said I bought them Amazon Warehouse, therefore they were used, not new.

I now see that Jabra offers a LEFT earpiece by itself on Amazon for $59.00.  Why would they do that unless they knew there was a frequent problem with this piece, as there is simply no other reason to but a single, slave earpiece?

For those cheap ones as I have tried, and returned, them as these far exceeded my expectations. No muffled music or unclear phone calls. Go with Jabra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

lovely package (charging case), amazing looking buds. I was afraid that we might have a problem fitting it into my/daughter's ear, but it was a perfect fit, steady and comfortable. The sound was clear smooth and I couldn't detect any faults though I'm not much of an audiophile. installation was a breeze, using the dedicated app on an Android phone. As for battery life, well we didn't get to a point where we need to stop and recharge it during the day use, it is being charged every night (as a routine).
The best feedback is seeing my kid walking most of the day with these earbuds stuck in her ears.

The only cons. is having to shout to get my kid's attention. (The pass-through feature is great :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I could get it working again with all the available hacks and fixes online but it would always stop 5 minutes in a run leaving me fuming for the next 25 minutes.

The Good Stuff - These sound great. They are easy to use and are very comfortable in your ear. I wanted these to work.  I like the hear through feature and the sound cancellation.

Ultimately these were advertised as sport headphones and that is where they don't measure up.

Gym - They sound great but are prone to falling out if you make a facial expression while working out.  If you are training to be a champion at Expressionless Weight Lifting this might be a good training aid.  I tried hard to maintain no movement in my face but it was irritating.

Biking - These are not suitable for biking because if they fall out while you are on a bike, your chances of losing them for good are high (intersections, busy streets, etc.).  I tried with the ""hear through"" feature but the wind noise through the microphone makes it not feasible.  They are okay with the sound cancellation but not recommended for biking for safety reasons.

Running - These were actually most successful during running...at first.  They sounded great and they stayed in my ears fairly well.  I think running in Houston may have pushed the limits of the sweat resistance in these ear buds.  After a month the left ear bud kept failing - too much sweat caused it to seal against the ear too much and stop functioning.  Sometimes it would just fail altogether.  In pressure on the ear buds to hold them in would stop them form working.

I think if you only used them in an office setting, they would be okay. Or if you wanted to work on facial expression control at the gym...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_311?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=311&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Jabra warranty service came through.","Pros: Actual product.  Best available at this price point, at least when I purchased last year.  For me, they are very comfortable to wear.  Only downside functionally is the buttons are a challenge to use while in ear.
Cons: Left earbud failure (no light/charge) at 9 months in.  Jabra Phone support is understaffed (long hold times), but helpful when you finally get through.  Troubleshooting generic instructions out of date (refer to software features that have changed) and not specific to issues you report.  Phone support opened ticket and sent form to start a warranty exchange if necessary.  However, it took a week to receive back response and receive the shipping label, with no communication in the interim.  Process could be improved.  I also inquired if an advance exchange program was available (credit card hold -> ship replacement before old is received to make things faster), but there is not.

Once the defective item was shipped back in, replacement actually shipped out pretty quickly, I received them the next week after the defective pair shown as arrived on tracking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Saw prior reviews on it, many were positive, decided to take a shot, even though I had a bad past experience with the Samsung Icon x 2018 vers.
My product was ""used"" so I can't say for sure..but I have my personal likes and dislikes
Sound quality for media/music is good..cannot complain..
I like the ""Alexa"" integration voice commands with the headset and seems to work ""okay"".
Phone conversations were not so good unless you're in a Semi quiet area, but.... battery life was pretty good.
My issues were sometimes one side would randomly lose sound, but not long enough or frequent enough to get upset about it.
Earbuds may provide some discomfort after lengthy use....
And charging case used to turn off/disconnect earbuds automatically, now I have to turn it off/ disconnect manually by holding right earbud button down till it flashes red 3x.
Also sometimes you may lose sound in the left earbud so you will have to put it back in the charging case to get back sound.

It’s also really easy to see how much charge is left in the earphones and the case. Phone conversations work well. I haven’t had any complaints on the volume or clarity of my voice on work conference calls. The hear through feature is a feature that I will look for in all of my in ear head phones going forward.

I was debating between these and the Samsung iconx. The buds are pretty comfortable overall with the ability to listen to them for about 3 hours before fatigue. The sound quality was great for what these are. Controls were not great, with the volume and skip on one side and play pause on the other. I found it annoying when listening to just one ear. Even with both in, pushing the control buttons made the earbuds jam into my ear. Also, the right ear is dominant so you can not listen to just the right bud by itself.

Ended up going with the iconx because of the better controls and ability to use either ear independently. Not sure why other companies are not following that trend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_72?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=72&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pairing was easy, and the app worked fine. I just didn't like the sound, mainly due to a a serious lack of bass. No amount of fitting or adjusting the equalizer (either via their app or the Samsung music app) could provide the bass sounds that just weren't there. I have a much older Bluetooth headphone, Jaybird Bluebuds (that have the wire between left and right earpieces), and they have much better bass response that I'd rate as fully competitive with better wired headphones.

The headphones sound amazing for what they are.  I wasn't expecting much out of these, but they are louder and have better sound quality than all of the wired wireless buds I've used in the past.(lg, bose, and sony)  I literally just leave the case on my car charger and have them charging when I drive.  I've never seen a low battery warning and I usually have 2 hour gym sessions.  By the end of my session I usually have more than 80% battery left.  They're not lying when they say the ear buds have 5+hours on 1 charge.  Connection wise, with bluetooth 5.0, I can watch videos on my pixel without having the early Speed Racer audio sync effect.  The earbuds also fit great!  Like mentioned earlier, I workout for 2 hours sessions usually and they have never once been close to falling out.  There are plenty of other ear pieces in the box to get your fitment just right incase you do have problems, however.  I don't miss using my big over the ear headphones at the gym, other headphones would fall off doing abs or a set on bench, these never fall out or get in the way, and they are hands down the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.  I've had them for 4 months now, so I'm comfortable giving these ear buds my recommendation to anyone whose on the fence between these and other true wireless headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In a quiet office its very difficult to be heard, outside its impossible. For some reason noises from across the street come in louder than my voice.

It randomly has a hard time connecting to my phones and will sometimes drop one or both at random. When I try to play audio it will sometimes play it out of the phone despite showing as being connected. Also, I play a lot of podcasts or youtube videos at 2x speed, which can sometimes result in a staccato like effect where only short bursts of noise will play until it finally syncs up properly. I never seem to have this issue when connecting to any of my rental cars so I'm assuming the issue is with Jabra.

Lastly, the little magnets they use in the case to turn off/on the headphones can sometimes get dislodged.

Other than that, I think the sound quality is good. I like the app. It fits in my ears snugly for regular use. With exercise my ears sweat and it can sometimes get loose, especially if I'm jumping around. On the elliptical or weight training its usually fine. I don't recommend falling asleep with them in on a plane as they tend to fall out when I roll my head and can get lost easily.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would give the headphones 5 stars except I feel I do need to take the price into account.

Compared to the new Galaxy Buds, the sound quality is noticeably much better on the Jabras, even to someone who is not particularly an audiophile. Jabra also seems to have done a slight refresh on the case design in the past year or so, as there were some subtle changes. Customer service was great--they sent me a new set when I had an issue with my old case.

Still, the design of the Galaxy Buds case is a bit better, a bit smaller, and easier to handle, although the battery life suffers for it. I own both and travel with the Galaxy Buds and use the Jabra for my home computer. If you care about audio quality I think you should go with these, if you don't care about audio quality much or at all you can consider the Buds at the lower price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The music sound quality on these is at least as good as all of them except the Ultimate Ears Triple.fi 10s, which are still my gold standard.  But these Jabras are not far off of it, at least for regular phone-powered use.  (They sound much better than the Jaybird X3s that I recently purchased, which are perfectly fine headphones at about 1/3 the cost but are ridiculously bass-heavy, wired together, and also use a ridiculous proprietary charging cable.)  For truly wireless headphones, I'm really impressed by how good these sound, and the Jabra app makes fine-tuning to suit your tastes really easy.  The controls are intuitive and work well, and the HearThrough feature is really clever to allow you to keep them in even when you need to hear the outside world.  It's hard to imagine better truly wireless headphones at this price point, and everything seems very well thought-out and tested.

For those thinking these things are underpowered bass-wise, make sure you're trying different tips to get a good seal in the ear - changing to the largest included tip made a big difference for me.  They're nicely balanced, and with EQ adjustments can definitely get very bass-heavy if that's your thing.

Final note:  After updating the firmware, I had a lot of interference/connection issues between the left and right bud and was about to declare my pair a lemon.  But after about 5 minutes that went away and now they're back to sounding perfect.  Hopefully that will last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screw-in lock-in system hurts","The active 25% off sale tipped the balance and I decided to buy a new pair. I tried them for about an hour before *having * to take them off. I'm sure you have read if not watched a number of mostly positive reviews, so I will skip to my summary of why I wouldn't recommend this headphones.

They look good, but bulky, the sound is only reasonably good and the range didn't impress. But by far the most important thing that you should know is that these are too big and coupled with the lock-in system that inserts them into your ear canal, your ears will most likely hurt after more than 30min of continued use. To make things worse, pressing the buttons means pushing them further in...

If you have normal sized ears, be aware that the lock-in fit will probably hurt. And if you can't keep them in for more than 30min, all the great features that these headphone promise are useless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_327?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=327&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros-
Sound decent. I have no complaints about it compared to my se215s.
Can fit them inside my Arai helmet.
They stay put in the helmet and when walking around.
They look decent
There battery life is great.

Here's the same issues everyone else has.
Cons-
These are wide and hurt my ears if worn to long.
Taking my helmet off is very tricky, they like to roll out and press again my head (very painful).

The Bluetooth connection is very finicky, it works fine in my pocket and jacket but if i kneel down and my leg and torso encapsulate my phone the buds cut out. The buds are 1 foot away even!

My left bud actually seems a tiny bit louder than my right, no way to adjust either.
A lot of reviews of the app talk about how it breaks or ruins the buds.

In conclusion, these are still my cheapest, most reliable, best fitting option for travel and motorcycle rides so far. So cons asidei guess these will work but if you aren't in a hurry to buy, wait a few more years.

I have had a few occasions where I put them in the case, made sure they aligned, closed the box and then came back to use them a day later and they haven't charged.

So now I put them in, then wait, then open the case connect to them via mobile check if the battery charge has increased and then close the lid again.

I think it's crazy not to show when the earpieces are charging on the case. To have to open the case to see a red light, orange light or green light that flashed for a few times and then goes off is not good design. We need an indicator to tell us that they are charging.

Pros:
-Sound quality is really good. Almost no difference from non-Bluetooth headphones.
-The noise cancelation is great. My roommate is the loudest snorer on this planet, I just put these headphones in and then turn on some light rain noise and his snoring is gone.
-The headphones come with and quick option to hear-through. You just press the button on the right side headphone twice and it will activate the microphone and let you hear everything around you. It can be convenient for staying aware of your surroundings on a jog.
-The Jabra app is easy to use.

Cons:
-The microphone is actually a little lacking. If you’re anywhere other than a quiet room by yourself your voice may not get through well.

The battery life is phenomenal.  I don't listen to music 15 hours a day or anything, but I am popping these things in and out constantly.  The case is the perfect size to feel comfortable always having it with you while adding a ton of extra capacity.  I go a couple days forgetting to charge the case, they're fine.  I go a day forgetting to put an earbud in the case,  it's fine.

The sleep / wake battery saving is incredibly effective, and super snappy.  I'm never waiting for these to reconnect.  Range is great.  I'll have one in at work, leave my phone at my desk, go to the bathroom down the hall, and they still are streaming through the wall.

They fit me really well.  I'll forgot I've got one in my ear for hours, and when I take it out I somehow feel less comfortable.

Call quality while driving is better than anything else I've tried.  The hear-through is very well implemented.

The phone app is well designed, does exactly what it says it'll do, and does it well.

I use these headphone everyday as a traveling professional to handle phone calls, music, exercise.  As no one product is a master of all trades, these are excellent for what they are.

Noise canceling - theyre never going to be my bose quiet comforts, however they handle airplanes, airports, city streets, office, and gym well enough to pass.

Phone calls - solid connection with the other end hearing me clear.  However, the external microphones do pickup a lot of background noise so be aware of your environment.  If youre in NYC during rush hour people will hear all your surrounding noises so be mindful of that.  Its no different if you were using the phone as is.

Exercise - these buds dont slip, move, and stay put both indoor and outdoor activities.  Sweat also doesnt seem to add to any issues with ear security.  Ive worn these a full 6 hours before and never experienced the ""ear phatigue"" most headphones cause.  They are comfortable and deliver what I need them to day in and out.

Overall a great purchase, just make sure to stay updated on the latest firmware for optimized performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They work fine...but they are not worth the price.  Sound quality is fine and the range is okay (it reaches about a third to halfway across my one-story house).  I'm also not convinced they are noise-cancelling.

I WILL say that these little suckers a durable.  I cram these in my ears and they fall out after 5-10 minutes if I'm doing good. I've tried changing the earbud cushions to the different sizes in an attempt to keep them in place with no luck.  I'm mostly impressed they are still alive.  One popped out into a bucket of soapy water...still works.  Another time one fell out, hit the pavement hard, and rolled down the hill...still works. Additionally the earbuds do really irritate my ears.  It makes them itch and feel like a bug is crawling in them.  I like the earbuds I just can't wear them for long.

On a personal level I regret buying the rose gold color.  This was my mistake, but I did not realize how beige the sides were and that is what is mostly seen.  It looks like I have tumors coming out of my ears.  I try to cover them with my hair when I go out.

I purchased them thinking I'd hate them, since I'd been using my boyfriend's airpods for a while and really started to like them. However, I wanted a sound canceling experience and the airpods sometimes bothered my ears if I wore them for too long. When I got these, I was very surprised and happy.

Pros:
They have a ""sound through"" feature that makes it so you can hear through them, which I had no idea when I bought them. This is SO perfect since you can choose to have them like an airpod experience or through regular noise resistance. I've worn them biking regularly, and feel confident I can hear traffic and other important noises through the feature. I also workout with them, a lot of cardio and they don't shake out of my head one bit.

When you take one out, the music stops. This is something I loved about airpods, and I'm glad you can optionally keep it with these.

The battery life and case are stellar!

The volume/skip play/pause/siri controls are awesome. Way better than the limited controls of airpods.

They don't look too bulky

You can connect two devices at once!? (macbook and iphone!)

Cons
I've had a little bit of connectivity issues with the left pod, but it's extremely quick and not very often. Sometimes they're also too big for my ears, but I have smaller ears so that's pretty common for me. I've found a way to adjust them so they don't hurt for longterm use.

It took me a while to figure out how to turn them off, and sometimes they turn themselves back on after you take one out and accidentally touch the sensors again when you put them down. They can start playing music again when you think they should be turning off","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These headphones have a persistent background static that is present with many types of audio (particularly with podcasts/classical music).

The “audio stop” feature when you take out one ear bud is attrocious. Music pauses in the earbuds that remains in your ear, but continues in the one you remove. I tried to turn the feature off, but that didn’t work either.

Lastly, recently these have started cutting out sporadically (despite the fact that my phone is inches away).

Here’s the cherry on top: customer service is ATROCIOUS. I filed a claim with Jabra December 15th. They didn’t reply for three weeks. Then they said they would send me a replacement earbud (just one earbud, rather than the set). Then no word for another month, when they notified me that there’s a back order and I won’t receive the earbud for an ADDITIONAL month. I tried calling them but of course no one picks up.

Tl;dr - Jabra is an awful company. Spend your money elsewhere","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One flaw, does not magnetically attach inside charger case. Lost my left earbud within the first 2 hours of ownership. Found it later that night at the restaurant where it fell out. Luckily they are durable as well and got kicked into a corner under a bar stool and didn't sustain any damage.
Still sounds good (made equalizer adjustments with the app). Bass is not overly powerful but the high-hat hits come in a little sharp out of the box. Several settings can be save for sound and automatically switch over based on what is happening (can pre-set for: music, calls, and noise filtering).
Can listen with one earbud (right only) , but take one out of your ear and it will automatically pause music (cool!) put it (left bud) in the case, press play and it resumes with the single (right) earbud.

I’m a huge audiophile owning everything from B&O, to my current Martin Logan’s. So to me, spending an extra $100 to see if B&O would outperform the Jabra’s is well worth it, or so I thought.

I put one of each in each ear to truly compare the difference.

Treble: Same
Mid range: Jabra
Bass: Jabra
Sound stage: Jabra
Connectivity: Jabra
Ease of use: Jabra
iOS App: Jabra

So the sound blows away the audio “experts” at B&O. The B&O sound more like what I would expect from Sony.

The connectivity is flawless from jabra. There’s a voice prompt that informs you of everything; “connected, not connected, looking for Bluetooth”, etc... while on the B&O you have to decipher a light located on the inside of ONLY the right earpiece.

The button on the B&O do not click or inform of any press while on the Jabra you can clearly decipher a press to know it’s been activated. Important when you want to change tracks while running or activate any function while on the go.

I felt the B&O sticks out more than the Jabra’s. And the Jabra’s find their correct orientation much easier than the B&O.

The rubber ear pads fit much more snug on the Jabra’s. I can feel very comfortable with my sprints using my Jabra’s while the B&O feel more flimsy.

The soundstage and full rich sound on the Jabra’s are very good compared to the B&O. The B&O sound empty, lifeless, and boring. The B&O app is attrocious for anyone that cares about detail in sound. The B&O splits audio frequencies in the terms “warm, excited, relaxed, and bright”. While the Jabra shows a full range EQ bar. Not sure what B&O was thinking but clearly the designer of the app was not an audiophile.

I wrote this review to help someone that truly cares about the best sound quality. I’m now headed back to Best Buy to return the B&O. The review between them didn’t even take ten minutes to decide which is best.

I’m very happy with Jabra. B&O, you’ve proved that money doesn’t always buy happiness🙃.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They work great and have a lot of carefully thought out features.","This is my first pair of wireless headphones.  I purchased them to replace a pair of Bose wired earbuds that I used for exercise.  I made the decision based on some reviews I had read of wireless exercise earbuds.

I’m quite impressed with them and very happy that I purchased them.  I keep finding new features and they work better than I thought they would.

I pair them with two devices.  The first is my phone.  The second is a Bluetooth transmitter that I plug into my TV when I’m jogging on my treadmill.  I expected to need to un-pair and re-pair each device when I wanted to use one or the other but it seamlessly remembers and uses both as appropriate.  There is a very small delay (a fraction of a second) in watching TV this way but it isn’t enough that it bothers me.  I have to concentrate on delay to even notice it.

The headphones provide a variety of voice prompts that help use it.  The app notifies the user and updates firmware when available, and guides the user through making the update.  The user interface is carefully thought though, all the way down to the colors of the LEDs in the charging case that indicate various things.

The headphones have a pass-through feature where they use the external mic to pass audio so you can better hear what’s going on around you.  I don’t recommend using these while exercising in safety critical environments like bicycling.  The feature works well but is masked by whatever you are listening to.  But it works great if you use it to hear people talking to you while you have them in.

I’d suggest a couple improvements - first is the ability to reprogram some of the buttons (at least one of them).  You can use a button press to activate a voice assistant (either Alexa or Siri).  That’s not that useful to me.  I’d rather have the ability to turn on or off the pass through feature. Another improvement would to to increase the response time of the pause.  If someone’s talking to me and I need to pause the headphones, it takes several seconds.  It would be nice to mute the voice immediately even if the actual pause takes a couple seconds to register on the phone and I miss a few seconds of audio.  The ability to “pause and active pass through” quickly would be perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_303?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=303&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cons: anemic sound, very sensitive to interference.

I really wanted to like these. After spending many years with Bose products, I wanted to see what other brands had to offer. These were very highly recommended by many tech websites and product reviewers, with the caveat that true wireless earbud technology isn't all there yet. These earbuds have the most recent, highest fidelity iteration of Bluetooth technology (Bluetooth 5.0)...but it's meaningless if the audio device (e.g an iPhone) doesn't support the same. I has happy for a couple hours until I started noticing the less-than-satisfactory audio.

Overall, the sound is a little thin. It might be because the buds aren't that well sealing (easily solved by getting better fitting ear pieces) despite the overall excellent fit. The equalizer on the companion app can really meaningfully impact the sound quality depending on the song...but it's ridiculous to have to pull up and change the equalizer every time the song changes.

The absolute biggest problem was a persistent, underlying static in the left earbud while audio was playing, specifically. I'm not sure if this were due to interference from other devices because it happened ONLY while the left earbud was playing audio and not while the audio was paused, but it was definitely, wholly unacceptable. I might have gotten a defective left earbud; apparently this is not uncommon, judging from other reviews and sources, with this product.

I've since picked up a pair of the SoundSport Free and haven't had any static problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I decided to post the review here for greater visibility so that it can help more people inform their decision on whether to buy these. So there it is:

Excellent Sound:
I've had these for a few weeks now. I've very pleased with their audio quality. Besides the Jabras I mainly use audio technica ATH-M50x. With those headphones being my main point of reference, I can say the Jabras represent highs, lows and mids quite well. What I find most impressive about them, however, is their stereo separation. I don't know if it's specific to the Jabras or inherent in truly wireless earbuds, but the separation between left and right channels is noticeably distinct and has resulted in a fun experience listening to music. I listen to many genres, including but not limited to hip-hop, rock, pop, and electronic.

They provide good isolation. I commute daily by subway and they do a fine job of blocking out external noise. I like that they pause automatically when I remove them from my ears.

I can't speak to the battery life because I've never listened for 5 hours straight. I keep them in the case when not in use and I'd estimate that I use them between 3-4 hours a day. Using them in this manner, I think I've been charging the case maybe every 3 days after I see the light on the case turn red.

My preference would have been to give them 4.5 stars. They do suffer from terrible interference from time to time. I haven't been able to figure out what causes it. At first I thought it was proximity to other bluetooth devices. Then I thought it was putting my hand in my pocket over the phone and somehow blocking the signal. I keep my phone in my left pocket and I thought maybe it was my body blocking the signal to the right earbud. But it happens randomly. The only thing that I can pinpoint for sure that causes interference are the anti-theft gates that some stores have at their entrance. The once that sound an alarm as you pass through them if a security tag hasn't been deactivated. Those gates always cause the earbuds to hiccup. My hope is that a firmware update makes them more stable. But to be clear, this type of interference happens maybe 5% of the time that I'm using them.

Update 1: Regarding interference issues:
After noting the interference issue cropping up from time to time it finally occurred to me that it wasn't an issue with the jabras but perhaps an issue with my iphone 6 or bluetooth itself. I did a little googling and found that sites stating that the water content in our bodies can interfere with the signal. With that being said, I can't rightly fault the jabras. My hope is that when I finally get around to upgrading my phone, it will have a more powerful bluetooth transmitter. Over all 5 stars for the Jabras. I love their sound.

Update 2: Another problem cropping up
Another couple weeks and a new issue has come up. When you put the earbuds in the charging case, they're supposed to automatically turn off. Lately, the right earbud turns off but within a minute turns back on and connects to my phone while it's still in the charging case. Before making this discovery, I thought  the battery on the charging case was draining faster than usual. It wasn't until a few times when I had switched to wireless headphones and the audio dropped out did I finally figure out what was happening. I sent an email to jabra support about this problem. Their recommendation was to unpair, forget the device from my bluetooth settings, and resinstall the firmware. Didn't solve the problem.

If you've gotten this far, I'll leave this final thought. These earbuds are not perfect. I have to remind myself to turn the earbuds off before putting them back in their case. And it's important to remind people that the sound quality for many earbuds will depend greatly on how well they fit and seal in your ear canal.  For me, the price and the flaws have been worth it for how good they sound. Love listening to music with reverb on these. Classic rock sounds fantastic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

By “pretty good” I mean the sound is good, the microphone works well and I’m generally pleased.  The problems are these: the left bud often gets disconnected from the right and you have to turn them off and sometimes put them in the recharger to get the left one back; the battery drains faster than advertised; they are OK during workouts but not completely secure- mine fall out about every 20 minutes of aerobic workouts.  Keeping track of the recharging box has been an issue of mine; I have already lost one and had to replace it for 80 bucks!  I kind of wish these could be wirelessly charged through other means than the box.  Still, I think these are good ear buds.  I wear them a lot and mostly get along just fine.  The price is good and I trust the Jabra brand when it comes to devices like these.  From what I can tell, most of the wireless buds have the same kinds of problems as I’ve found with these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_309?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=309&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These left me so disappointed. I wish they would have worked. In the end, I have decided to return them. They have several pro's but the con's were too much to overlook, especially for the price.

Previously, I owned beats x, which died on me after 1 year and 2 months. In that year and 2 months never once did they drop connection or cause me issues by being connected to multiple devices. The Jabra's cannot handling being connected on multiple devices. They do have the capability of connecting but it distorts functionality. The devices interfere with one another and this causes serious connectivity issues, and frequent dropping. The left ear bud randomly shuts off often...annoying. It has to be returned to the charging case to reconnect. After ensuring they are only connected to one device while in use, I still experienced dropping, not as bad, but far too much for the price point. I also hated the case, they are not magnetic like most true wireless. The earbuds barely sit down in and go flying, when you open the case, which is actually quite hard to open.

***Worst of all, these aren't compatible with computers!!!! WHAT?! Why would I want a pair of ear buds that doesn't work on all of my devices? They do work for audio on my device, but the microphone is not compatible. When investigating this, Jabra states in their FAQ's that they do not guarantee any functionality with devices other than mobile phones...

I loved the app, the ambient noise and different modes. I loved the hear through functionality and I actually thought these did a decent job for noise cancelation. The ear tips, could be better, but comfort-wise these aren't bad overall. The sound quality is decent, and I preferred it over beats x. Sadly, I am returning these and buying a new pair of beats x. I wish the connectivity issues weren't so bad, otherwise I would've loved to keep them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use these at the gym and I’m a box jump, cleans, CrossFitty type guy and need something that won’t move.

I have gone through nearly every brand of truly wireless headphones including Bose, AirPods, and the lesser known brands Best Buy carries.  They all fell out of my ears no matter what tips I used.

The Jabra’s stay in my ear.  The sound is as good/maybe a little bit better than Powerbeats3 but I don’t have to deal with the wire.  The Bluetooth5 is *almost* as good as Apple’s W chip.  Setup was very easy on an IPhoneX and the connection was solid.

On the surface there's many things about these airpod competitors that make them better than airpods. They have better sound quality, block out more noise, the built in buttons allow you to fastfoward, rewind, and adjust the volume, they're compatible with android's google assistant, and they have an Android app with many settings. However, the only thing that matters at the end of the day is whether they stay in your ear, and these do not. Despite trying all the different tips, I consistently found these would fall out when I was doing the dishes, when I laughed (because of the jaw motion), or when I played virtual reality games. Despite being a die hard Android user, I bought a pair of Airpods and they do not fall out of your ear. It's a bit ironic because the Airpods feel as though they move around more in your ear more than the Elite 65t, but because the stem acts as an anchor they stay in. I miss the Android compatibility and great features of the Elite 65t, but at least the Airpods serve the primary goal.

All this would lead me to a 2 star review. However, after owning these for about 2.5 months, they ceased to work and the primary bud (the right one) no longer turns on or charges. I've contacted Jabra support but not heard back from them (I only just contacted them, so I'm not holding the response time against them). I'll think about upgrading my rating if the customer support is really good.

Bottom line: these aren't ready for prime time again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Questionable ambient noise reduction!","Don't expect bass from these earbuds. The audio is clear,  great separation between buds but zero bass (no matter how you fiddle with the app's so-called sound customization). Secondly, I don't understand their ambient noise reduction claim. Recently, I was in an airport waiting area listening to techno. I could hear the conversation of the couple next to me as well as all flight announcements. I found no difference when I turned on the""hearthrough"" feature. Now for the good: They actually stay in my ears! I've always had a problem with any earbuds fitting, but Jabra has done a great job ergonomically. Sometimes, after an hour so, my ears tire and I need to adjust the buds  slightly. I have a Google Pixel 2 and the earbuds consistently connect to my bluetooth the second they are out of their box. The carrying case is also small enough to fit in front pocket of my slim fit without looking too bulky.  And a feature not advertised: You can turn them on/off manually without using the case (in case you want to leave the case at home). Calls are clear per friends. Overall, this is a competent set of earbuds. But if this is one of the best, there's a lot of room for improvement in the wireless earbud market.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_403?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=403&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I travel a lot for work and these seemed to be a better alternative to the Apple AirPods. The product failed to meet my expectations. While the sound quality and noise blocking is great for listening to music, watching movies, etc.. This product is marketed as great for phone calls as well. Let me be clear it’s horrible for phone calls.

The microphone does exactly the opposite of what its intend to do. It picks up ambient noise instead of blocking ambient noise. I first noticed this when talking to my wife on the phone while at a coffee shop. She asked me where I was and said that she could hear the bartisa making drinks like I was standing right next to them. In reality I was about 10-15 feet away. Normal headphones without ambient noise blocking microphones wouldn’t even pick that up.

I contacted Jabra support about this issue. They told me to update the firmware and unpair and repair with my devices. I did this and nothing has changed. I contacted support again as follow up and received a canned reply. So essentially contacting support is worthless.

If you’re looking for headphones to just listen to music while working out these might be ok, just make sure you get a good deal as they’re priced to do more than that.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

3. product detail - looks nice on the outside.
Cons:
1. while wearing the earbuds - they are not the most comfortable ear buds for someone with small ears they're kind of bulky.
2. appearance on smaller ears (gold) I think it looks bulky on someone with smaller ears, some things might be more noticeable because of the beige but if it was black wouldn't really be noticeable. The color may make a different, I notice that there aren't much pictures of the gold color on the models ears. If I had a chance to exchange the black one with gold I would do it.

This was after about two years of ownership so needless to say I had no complaint. However, the reason that it stopped working was sweat which, to my joy, was covered by a three year warranty. Now the reason I am giving such a negative review to such a great product is due to how I was treated after I attempted to get a warranty that I was owed. I stated the warranty process THREE MONTHS AGO and have not had the chance to communicate with an actual human until possibly a week ago. However, im still skeptical whether or not the person who emailed me was actual a human because even though I emailed them a week ago I have received no response. The communication is terrible and I have no idea whether or not im at a standstill. Unfortunately as well I have no way to check as the website makes it impossible to check into the warranty process once you have requested a ticket.

- Running: The earbuds stay put in my ears well, but their slight movement while running makes annoying ""booming"" noises when my feet hit the ground.

- Bicycling: The wind noise is terrible above about 8 MPH.

- Volume: The max volume is too low to be comfortably audible while lawn mowing with an electric mower.

- Phone conversation: works fine

- Charger: The pods in the charger are not symmetrical so you have to make sure to place the correct earbud into the correct hole.

I want to love these, but the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7 (ios 12.4) is unstable at best. It seems there's no rhyme or reason to when and to which apps they will connect. For instance, if I'm listening to NPR via the NPR app, and then decide to switch to Spotify, the Bluetooth sync will inevitably fail between the two apps, and I'll need to either turn off the headphones and turn them back on, or reset the device by putting them back into their charging case. Sometimes, they'll fail to connect all together. The user experience of these is terrible, and leaves me more frustrated than any other piece of technology which I currently own.

I have always used flagship earphones/IEMs such as Sennheiser IE8's or Westone 3 etc and been very satisfied with sound. But over the years, even they have suffered wire damage due to repeated tugging and untangling during commutes or sweat around the ear and no matter that tangle-free technology they try, wires always tangle even in the best earphones. So recently after lot of friends shared positive experience with true wireless earphones, I thought of giving them a try.
I wanted to try Sennheiser momentums but they are too large and they have several software and battery drain issues which haven't been fixed so far..battery drain is a straight dealbreaker as my main reason for not going wireless was low battery..its a shame if your headphones now die before your smartphones battery.
Jabra repeatedly came up in all reviews and all suggestions and decided to simply order them.
Do note..These are not balanced armatures as used on most sound blocking high end IEMs ..but use dynamic drivers..which produce more bass but lack intricate details of sound in general in comparison.

Sound is great, Bass is full and nice punch to it....in the first few days..theres certain distortion to sound in bass heavy songs but it goes down as dynamic driver breaks in...but its still there in certain songs. The highs are crisp although missing details and loudness of my westone 3. The vocals are clear with accurate tonality of the singer.
Overall, they sound very good for bluetooth earphones and sound like a $80 pair of dynamic driver wired earphones out of the box....but these provide true freedom..i can walk around house, move my head freely..no microphonics of wired earphones.
There is clear stereo separation which is very impressive as most cheap earphones make sound feel 'in your head'.
The passive sound blocking is also very good as their snug ear anatomical fit blocks out noise in the trains.

The app EQ settings allow decent adjustments to sound and usually 'Energise' setting gives nice U-shape sound ideal for noisy commute as higher bass blocks out noise and elevated highs bring out life to the song.

The call quality is impressive as callers could hear me talk clearly even in a noisy city street.

My 2 main complaints:
- the earphones dont stick to case with a magnet..this is scary as opening case gives the feeling they might fall out or if some friend unknowingly tries to open them.
- the dynamic driver is small..and this results in bass not being as good as really expensive earphones and it can get muddy at times in very bass heavy songs...a larger sound driver in future models will solve this problem...but i guess jabra wanted small design hence they went with the choice.
- the buttons are very intuitively located and easy to use but they need to be softer or touch sensitive i guess as pressing volume button on left earphone pushes the earphone uncomfortably deeper into your ear.

I am keeping them now as they are the perfect commuter earphones and fun for lounging at home also...i will see how durable they are with test of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_308?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=308&reviewerType=all_reviews"

High quality, wear all the time, especially workouts ear buds. In practice, they are just weird. First lesson - do NOT connect them to multiple devices. They may claim that works, but the management is really bad - switching from my iPhone to my PC arbitrarily. They are also pretty bad with phone calls - the microphone is very noisy and it stops working in the middle of conversations. This happened multiple times when I wasn't even near the PC. I was hoping for a more general solution. Instead, now I have them set to just my phone. Another issue is the left/right balance seems to be off. The left side seems to be lower volume and I can't fix it. I have to take out the right bud just to make sure the left is working. My base line comparison is the Bose QC20s. I love these earbuds, but I hate the wire. A similar price, but the Jabra does not have noise cancellation, and the sound quality seems much lower to me.

J65T did everything well.  Sound quality very good.  BT connection stable.  Mic use during phone calls very good.  Software adequate but lots of minor annoyances (I'm a software engineer).  Excellent ergonomics.  Case is perfect size - love the case based recharge.  Bottom line: I use these earbuds all the time whereas in the past I only used earbuds on occasion.  Reason for my 4 star review - that's about as high as I go - I reserve 5-star for exceptional products.  4 star is very high praise.  One major issue:  Left earbud occasionally fails - take it out of the case and it won't connect.  (FYI: right earbud is ""master""; it maintains the BT connection to source device; left earbud has nfc connection to right.)  Problem doesn't occur often but when it does it is very annoying.  Talked with Jabra support.  They were nice but weren't able to offer a definitive solution....problem remains.  When they don't connect I go thru the dance of power cycling - putting back in case, etc...eventually they connect but process takes 10 min or longer which is unacceptable.  Might force me to return or exchange.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_312?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=312&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They fit well and I don't feel like they're going to fall out of my ear.  However, after a little while wearing them, I feel this pressure on one spot on my ear.  Ears are basically the same shape, but mine are apparently not the same shape as these ear buds.  The sound is great.  I like the option to only wear one because when I run I like to be able to still have my situational awareness so it's nice that I can utilize that.  I wish either bud would functional independently of each other, but it's probably a technical nightmare to make that happen.

These being used and the most expensive. I can say this. They stay in my ears. I ran 7 - 1/2 miles with them in and had not one single signal loss or falling out of my ears.

My review. I synced these ear buds to my Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Used the Google music app, and put the phone in my Camelback and on my back. Everything worked as it was designed. Now I can saw this. It's very important that you test the different size ear insert pieces. I didn't like any that came with. I have the hard rubber insert and size small. They seem to work best for my ear canals.

These are on the large size for earbuds. However they are not heavy and after an hour of continued use, I didn't have any soreness in my ears. I found them to be very comfy. Phone calls seem to not be an issue at all.

One thing that I had to get use to. And again this review is based on one 7.50 mile run. I had the feeling in my left ear that the earbud was getting loose or about to fall. When I checked, the Bud was still securely in place. I think it had not to do with the style of ear insert. There was absolutely no movement or need to re adjust during my entire run. I had flawless sound for a little over an hour run.  I even use one ear bud sometimes as a Bluetooth for phone calls while walking around. So bottom line. Yes it's a good buy. I got mine slightly cheaper used in like new condition. And I could not tell they were used so the discount price was perfect. I did get a cheap set no name brand of wish app. Used them once on some Hill sprints and they didn't fall out. My advice do your research on YouTube and try a few different options. Find what works for your lifestyle and budget. Again this is a one run review mild temperature and moderate sweating.

I don't jog around town with earbuds, travel on a subway, or sit at a desk with headphones. Just the gym. And these earbuds were the first true-wireless bluetooth headphones I've ever purchased. (I've been rocking $20 Sony wired earbuds for my entire life)

PRO's:
- Super super easy to set up/pair/update firmware.
- Physical quality of the earbuds are fantastic.
- Battery life is craaaazy good.
- Fit is amazing. Even though it looks like they may fall out of your ears (due to no wing-tip-type things) they are IN THERE, even if I'm blasting away on the treadmill.
- Sound quality is about what I expected. Everything is real ""bouncy"" which I enjoy. Bass is there but not overpowering. But overall, real good.

CONs:
- Jesus Christ on the cross, there is a persistent hissing sound in the left earbud that apparently is just there forever. I'm actually on my second pair of earbuds because I thought the hissing was maybe a defective earbud, so after speaking with Jabra customer service, I was sent a replacement set. (It took way too long for the replacement to arrive, but that's a different story). To my sadness, the left earbud still has the faint hissing. Oh well. Maybe it's an issue that plagues all bluetooth headphones? Maybe I'm just a jerk who is too picky? There is no hissing in my $20 Sony wired earbuds...

CONLUSION:
It's great to not be encumbered by wires danging everywhere while I work out. The Jabra Elite 65t's sound great, they fit great, and I don't have to worry about ever running out of batteries (I keep the charging case in my car and just pop the earbuds back in there every day).

However... the hiss will slowly drive me insane. To be fair, my buddy has Jabra Elite 65t's (the non-active version) and he says he has no hiss. At any rate, would I recommend them? Yes, I would. If you want wireless earbuds, get these. They're great, and maybe your unit won't have that soft hiss. And if you're an audiophile, well, you probably aren't looking at wireless bluetooth earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good battery life
Nice design
Super convenient to not have cords

Cons:
Mediocre sound quality
Annoying static noises in earbuds

I bought these at Best Buy, but wanted to leave a review here to warn people about my experience with these headphones. First off, it's really nice not having cords. These are my first wireless earbuds, and it's super convenient. They are designed well and stay in your ear, and the battery life seems good.

The main issue is the static. I thought at first I had a defective pair of earbuds. Whenever the earbuds are active, they emit a somewhat subtle but definitely annoying static noises, especially from the right earbud. I don't like listening to my music particularly loud, so I constantly hear it over everything playing. After pausing audio I still hear it for about 20 seconds, and then it snaps off (I assume it goes into some power saving mode at that time). I exchanged the first pair for a new set (after going through all the firmware updates, resetting, blah blah etc etc troubleshooting), and they have the exact same problem. Either the hissing noise is on all units, or quality control is poor on this product - either way is not good.

Besides that, I probably wouldn't recommend this purely on the sound quality. It's just not that good. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I've gotten $20 wired earbuds from Amazon that sound better than these. For $160, that's just not acceptable.

Would not recommend these. Not worth the money as you will a) be stuck with annoying background static on everything you listen to, or b) have spent $160 on mediocre sounding earbuds, which just feels bad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Too bad the case designer wasn't the same!","I would have given them 4 stars - but can't --- read-on:

I own two sets of these ear-buds - one for me and one for my son. The sound quality, and sound-cancelling quality, are unparalleled. I've tried Bose, Apple, Plantronics - and these are the best - by far - the very best. I use them in my work for electronic ear-plugs - and they work better than any ear plug I've ever had. Listening to the radio while mowing - fantastic- quality sound and above-par noise-blocking. You won't find better. They fit firmly and don't stick out like some bad scene from Star Trek like the Bose headsets that I took back after one day... That's the good!

The bad? THE CASE! It's horrible!! It's small, black, smooth, crappy latch, doesn't 'tell' the phone where it's located --- just generally crap. More than once I've accidentally dropped the glass-smooth black case - and it pops right open and the ear-buds go shooting out of the case as they're basically spring-loaded against the charging contacts inside the case - and then I go hunting for them.

So - To help guard the $80 case and the $100 headphones, I've 'augmented' mine with a piece of blaze-orange heavy-nylon strip, zip-tied to a sticky-back that's super-glued to the back of the case - with a Tile that's zip-tied to the nylon strap. The case itself has a velcro cable-strap that's super-glued to the case back-and-bottom that then wraps around one end of the case when it's closed.

But then again, maybe Jabra meant the case to be so crappy so people would lose them and have to go buy more?!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was told to update the earbuds, which they were so I re-pushed the update. It still did not fix the issue. I went and got a newer pair but alas, that one had the same issue! Here were some of the things I noticed,
 - The static sounds goes away when there is nothing playing and the phone is not being used
 - As soon as I play something or use my phone, the static sound is continuous
 - The static sound is louder when the volume goes over the recommended volume

I enjoyed the headsets while I used them but I did not want to go back and get it replaced over and over again.

Originally, I had issues with terrible interference with these (wasn't an occasional skip...my podcasts or songs would be jumbled and would stop for minutes at a time).  After calling/writing customer service, I received a generic/template response on how to reset the earbuds...surprise, surprise - it didn't work.  I was planning on returning, but unfortunately, I dropped and damaged the right earbud.  Instead of being out the full $180, decided to purchase a replacement right earbud for $60.  My color (Blue/Copper) was apparently on ""backorder"" for single earbuds, but when purchasing, it specifically said ""It will be shipped out 2-3 weeks or sooner"".  It has been almost 8 weeks.  I have sent 3 or 4 support emails where I don't get any type of response other than a ""we've received your email"" type reply. And after calling customer service 3 times the past few weeks, I only get an acknowledgement that it's still on back order and they have no idea when it will be received.  Keep in mind that full new sets have been in stock this entire time.  For a customer who's spent $240 in the past 3 months on poorly functioning earbuds, a company should be attempting to make this right (send me a new full set, or remove the right one from one of the new sets).  Either way, we're venturing into customer service treatment comparable to dealing with a cable company or cellphone carrier, where it's a complete waste of time and extremely frustrating with no resolution.  I commute for work and exercise multiple times a week, so my earbuds are important to my everyday routine.  I really wish I had gone with another brand originally and really wish I hadn't accidentally damaged mine to then feel like I need to buy the replacement part or lose out on the full $180.  I strongly encourage people to take their business elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
They have a comfortable and secure fit.
Easy pairing with multiple devices.
Great sound quality.
Great battery life, I listen for about 2 hours a day and I charge the case once a week.

Cons:
The pass through sound feature is not great. Most times it blocks out ambient sounds even when I want to be able to hear them.
The microphone is not great, you have to speak quite loudly to have a good conversation.
The volume and track buttons are on the earbuds and you have to press on them. This is not comfortable as you end up pushing the ear piece into your ears. A touch style interface would have been better.

Importantly, I am writing this review because I am surprised by its durability. I accidentally put these through a full wash cycle. The earpieces (minus the case) were washed. I had no hopes they would work. However, they paired with my phone after a brief charge. I let them dry in the sun for a day and no the speakers work great. The sound is even better than before as I am guessing some of my ear wax was washed off the speakers. It’s amazing!

The Jabra's are very discreet.  It was the right choice - I love these earbuds!  Pairing with multiple devices was easy and the controls are simple and straightforward - no multiple buttons to push.  Three sizes of ear tips are included.  The trick for a good fit seems to be inserting the earbud and twisting down gently.  The sound is excellent and the ""hearthrough"" option allows you to adjust how much outside sound you want to hear while wearing them.  Since the right earbud is the ""master"" to the left ""slave"", I often just wear the right one for phone calls.  People have told me that the voice quality is perfect and they weren't even able to tell when I put in the earbud and switched from phone to the Jabra during a call.  They have a good range and there is an audible tone when I walk out of range so I know when I get too far from the phone.

Sound quality is great for my usage (probably 75/25 podcasts/music), I'm no audiophile but everything sounds great.
Comfort is so-so, which depends highly on the size & shape of your ears. These fit snugly with the default silicon tips for me, though on longer runs they sometimes shift out of place, which causes discomfort & requires a re-adjustment. Not a deal-breaker, but should be noted.
Noice cancellation is good for a set of earbuds (as opposed to on- or over-the-ear headphones). Its minor, but its there. What's really helpful for me is the sound passthru which sends outside sounds into the earbuds. This helps increase my awareness when running around town - I can hear cars approaching, for instance - but still can easily hear my music or podcasts.
Button controls are just OK. They work, but sometimes using them moves the buds around in your ear, either causing discomfort or requiring re-positioning. Still, they work but require some learning too, like any similar set.
Battery life is great, as-advertised for the most part from what I can tell. The case is great for storage & charging.
Other notable features:
-pairing is super easy (iPhone), and re-pairing is great. You simply remove them from the case, they automatically power on and pair to the device if its in range. You're ready to go in a couple seconds.
-Call quality is great, as is the mic quality from what people have told me. However, sometimes my phone gets confused and gets into a mode where nothing is accepting my voice; the earbuds, the phone, or the speakerphone. I can hear the other person, but no matter what input I switch to, they cannot hear me. It doesn't happen every time, but it has happened about 10% of the time, which is strange.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The issue with the echo ended up being the ""fit"" to my ear. The ear buds come with a medium rubber insert that was very uncomfortable so I swapped to the small which apparently was the root of the issue. I swapped back to the medium and although uncomfortable the echo problem is resolved.

I have had these for about 6 months. I bought these specifically to travel and talk for the noise cancelling. Several callers reported back to me that they hear themselves talk when they speak but hear me fine and I do not hear it.

Most of that time I have enjoyed the product however there are some huge downsides that had I know from the beginning would have lead me to chose a different pair.
1) These ear phones are not comfortable. The thing about these ear pieces is that they are huge! So huge my wife can't even use them. I spent the first month of owning these headphone getting used to the way these earbuds stretched out my ear, often painfully. If you have large ears, this wouldn't be a problem but if getting used to these will be painful if you have average or smaller ears.
2) The biggest problem is their bluetooth connectivity just fails randomly. I just spent about 30 minutes this morning trying to get the device to connect to either my phone or laptop. The earbuds of course were screaming in my ear to go to my bluetooth settings and connect. But the device could not make a connection to either device, Yes the could find it and even pair but not connect. After a while I gave up, turned the earbuds off for a while and when I came back they worked immediately. This is not an isolated experience either as similar scenarios have occurred 4 or 5 times since I bought these.
3) The microphones on the device are not great. While making a phone call through the earbuds is not usually a problems. The earbuds are relatively sound proof but boast a hear through feature to allow you to pay attention to your surroundings. Unfortunately, the microphones don't even pick up enough for you to have a decent face to face conversation with some one. While I personally take out earbuds when talking face-to-face to people, this translates to other the hear through feature failing miserably on more difficult tasks like when someone is trying to get your attention or a person is walking up behind you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was looking for a relatively discrete pair of wireless earbuds for filming videos while receiving feed and for walking and talking. And these we recommended as top of the line. I dished out the cash...but no good.  Even though I tried all of the ear plug sizes,they wouldn't stay in my ears and they were very painful...which has been a common problem for me with all small earbuds. I guess I never realized how small my ear holes are. You really don't walk around comparing ear hole sizes, now do you? Ahhh well... I'm going back to over the ear phones.

What a difference it makes having no cable connecting headphones to a device. These earbuds fit my ears just right with the larger silicone tip and once they've settled in It feels like sound is just emanating into my ears with no source. They're very light and comfortable - your mileage may vary, of course, as ear shapes are all different.

They pair just like any other bluetooth device and the connection is pretty solid. I've only had a couple of instances where they simply would not connect to my iPhone, as if one of the devices forgot about the other. Don't fight it, trust me - it won't work. Just remove the entry for the Jabra headphones and re-pair.

Sound quality is very good. I personally don't hear any degradation in the sound due to being transmitted over bluetooth but other, maybe younger ears may pick up on what other reviewers are hearing. They're a little bass-heavy, but the Jabra app that needs to be installed on your device gives you an adjustable EQ which helps personalize things.

The app also allows you to set up pass-through sound, which means you can vary how much outside sound makes it through to your ears. I don't personally need this feature - if someone wants to talk to me, I feel like I need to remove my headphones and actually appear to be tuned in to them. I keep this off for my lawn mowing duties - I really don't want to listen to that!

The charger-case is great as well. The headphones slip right into their spot and there's only one way they'll fit, so the charging spots will always connect. There's also a light between the headphones that will appear when they connect to the case, and if you miss that, there's another light on the bottom when the lid is close to show that it is charging. Somehow, with about 10 weeks of mowing, I have yet to need to charge this case, so the battery life of 15 hours seems pretty legit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got these on sale for $159 plus 20% additional cash back, so essentially I only paid $128. Let me say however, these are not worth the regular price of $189.

Fit is very good for me. I've read many reviews citing a poor fit, or they don't stay in. I've not had that problem, even while sweating profusely in the rain. The finish on the actives makes all the difference, and I am thoroughly impressed thus far.

I'm satisfied with the sound, but I don't feel they sound as good as my Jaybird Freedom X3's, or even the Bose Soundsport Free. They do sound better than the Airpods though. Sound+ app is necessary so you can adjust the equalizer to meet your preference. You won't be blown away by the bass, but it's decent enough. With an asking price of $189, I expect the sound to be better. The hearthrough feature is good as well, but it does sound somewhat 'tinny'. I find myself using it often because it saves me from having to pop a bud out when my coworker is talking to me.

Many reviews have commented that the sound levels of the left/right buds are off, or the right bud is much quieter than the left one, or one of the buds stopped working completely after a short time...
Lest I forget the hundreds of reviews mentioning the poor/horrible customer support from Jabra.
For now, I've yet to experience any of these issues. This particular copper/black pair, exclusive to Amazon, came from the fresh batch that they received last week. I'm hoping some of the recurring issues have been solved, and I will update this review in the future if something happens.

I would recommend the Jabra Elite Actives if you can manage to get them on sale. If you're an audiophile, you'll probably be disappointed by the sound, but that's not to say they don't sound good. True wireless tech is still in it's infancy stage, and the sound quality will continue to get better. That said, the Jabra Elite Active 65t's are in my opinion one of the current front runners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When the Revols were first up on Kickstarter, they had a lot of unique, advanced features.  But they took 2+ years to deliver, and the market caught up to them.  These earbuds do everything the Revols promised me,often better than the Revols, and they cost less.

They pair effortlessly, and will even connect to multitple devices simultaneously with no complaints.  Every so often, if I take them out & leave them on my desk (not in the charging case) for a while, the left bud doesn't come back to life with the right when I reinsert them & continue playing my content.  A quick insertion into the case seems to fix this.

And that's my biggest complaint.  Sound quality is very good.

People I speak with on the phone tell me they have no clue I'm on earbuds.  I expected this from Jabra- part of the reason I chose them- and they appear to have delivered.

The ability to let some outside sound in is handy in an office, walking city streets, etc.

All buttons/functions work flawlessly.  Power, volume up/down, etc.  No issues whatsoever.

Batteries seem to give me 4+ hours on initial charge.  This is enough for most days in the office.  If you remember to put them back in the charging case when you step away from your desk for break, etc., they last well beyond all day, even with near constant use.

Biggest problem with the Revols was that even the small size molding tips were way too large for my ears, and the outside of my ears would be sore after a few hours of use.  (They didn't use the outside of the ear canal as the pressure point, but the cartilage of the outer ear.. long story)  These cause me no discomfort, and despite the fact that they do use the outer ear canal for the pressure/anchor point, they are VERY difficult to shake out.  I imagine if you took a header while jogging, you might lose them, but short of trauma, they're stable & secure.

Highly recommend these if they are within your price range.  Zero significant complaints or issues, good sound quality, and feature rich.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_389?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=389&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As one reviewer said, they're the best out there but they do have their flaws. On the good side, they stay connected to the phone quite well (I have an iPhone 7 with IOs 12) and I enjoy being able to walk around the room while on a call. They're very easy to use, and they do a decent job of passively blocking outside noise when listening to music. They fit in my ears very nicely and I don't have to worry about them falling out. I also love that when I receive a call, they tell me who is calling so I don't have to take the phone out of my pocket.

As for sound quality, they're good for what they are. They are not going to excite an audiophile and I won't be using them to mix an album. But the sound of music is clear and strong and it's fine for listening to music on the commute. They don't have a very strong bass, but the cool part is you can customize the EQ using the app to your preferences including more bass. I did find that the connection stutters a bit when the phone is in my pocket and I take a big step or do something that shakes the phone (like stepping off of a high curb). Doesn't happen with smaller movements.

As for quality of phone calls, I'm not amazed but they work well enough indoors. I live in NYC and had hoped they would allow me to have a conversation while walking on the street. It's extremely loud here so I wouldn't expect a miracle, but the person on the other end couldn't hear anything I was saying and only heard street noise. The phone was in my pocket and the reception was poor, which I don't think should happen and it's a downside of these headphones. For calls in a car, or an my office, they work really well and I can walk around the room without a problem. They pick up a good amount of noise including typing which can be annoying on a call.

This product is not perfect, but from reading many reviews by experts and non-experts, it seems they're the best thing out there in a field of products that are pretty new. It will get better. It's really nice to not have a wire hanging out, catching on things, pulling the headphones out of my ear and out of the phones. You'll have to decide for yourself if the benefits outweigh the limitations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_303?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=303&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. It helps to have average or above sized ears
2. They fit very tightly and that'll cause discomfort until your ears get used to it
3. They don't always hit the right angle on the ear canal. When they don't, they feel more like earplugs than headphones
4. The app is flukey. It stopped being able to ""see"" the connected buds after about a week and I uninstalled it for now (iOS)
5. The gold looks nice but the plastic around it is the color of a 1990s computer. If I had to order again, I'd go with the blacks
6. Like all true wireless earbuds, they'll lose the left-right connection if left idle for too long. You'll need to put them back in the charger case, close the case, then take them out again to fix it. This is probably okay since it'll reinforce the habit of always putting the earbuds in their case so you don't lose one.
7. Like all self-charging cases, this one is a bit clunky. It'll fit in my pocket but has a noticeable bulge.

These are, overall, great headphones. They will connect to my iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time (""two devices connected""), hold a good charge, and they stay in during a hard workout (amazing, really) despite having no ear hooks. The sound isn't exactly that of a reference monitor but they're literally earbuds. This s*** was sci-fi ten years ago.

I tried contacting Jabra about it, filed a claim and everything but the customer service is terrible. After taking over a week to contact me through email, they had me troubleshoot the problem but nothing worked. I tried to get a replacement pair but the company just kept trying to troubleshoot the problem. After 5 minutes on Reddit I found there is a common problem with the charging case where a magnet shifts out of place so it does not charge the earbud. It is over a year after I originally bought the Jabra Elite 65t earbuds and now both earbuds do not work, and I have switched to a new brand.

When I do, it wiggles the earbuds out of my ear and I keep having to adjust them. This doesn't happen with other earbuds, only this one.

They get scratched easily - The plastic used on the earbuds and the case get surface scratches very easily.

They have bugs - Sometimes the buttons stop working when the earbuds are on, and I have to put them into the case and take them out to reset them. They sometimes make a subtle clicking noise/lose connection for a brief moment even with the phone within 3ft range.

You can't just use left one/share one piece - If you decide to use just one earpiece, it has to be the right one. You cannot do that with the left piece.

Primarily used for workouts","After my stock apple ear pods gave up the ghost, I spend a long time researching true wireless buds.  I have a pair of ATH M50x over-ear headphones for my work music & focus fix that has served me well but are unsuitable for active wear.  I was willing to spend a bit extra to get a bit extra, and the form of the Jabra Elite Active 65t's, their weight, and the reviews of their sound quality/ workout niche all checked the right boxes.  The price point was still a smidgen too high but I decided to go ahead and purchase.  Glad I did!

My Pros:
- small carrying case: I really like the size.  It is about the size of 3 chapsticks put side by side.
- firm case latch:  other reviews dislike the lack of magnetic locking mechanism, and the Elite 65t case apparently didn't' close as well.  This case has a satisfying snap when closing that does not fall open in my pocket or gym bag, but also can be opened with one hand (thoughI have larger hands)
-decent passive noise isolation
-good voice/call quality
-good sound
-the hear-through feature is amazing, especially when I am biking and need to be aware of surroundings while still enjoying my beats.
-great connectivity with my iPhone 7.  Bluetooth range is fantastic.
-slim profile
-ability to control the playback from earbud buttons.  TBH I don't use this feature very much, though yesterday it was convenient while biking to be able to turn the volume down without pulling out my phone.

Cons:
-the buttons:  They are a bit stiff.  perhaps this will change with time but pushing them without holding the earbud from the other side mashes the Jabra Elite Active 65t further into my ear canal.  Not a fun sensation.
-difficult to find the right fit.  I give credit to Jabra for including the separate tips but it still took me a solid 2 weeks to finally figure out the set up that gives me the best comfort/sound.
-adjustment required:  They are not always just pop in and forget about them.  I need to adjust them every so often to tweak with the comfort level or the sound
-moisture wicking:  perhaps I am an exceptionally sweaty person, yet while the Elite Active's ""grip"" the ear firmly they sometimes slide out especially during mat exercises.  It's not a huge deal because I am already lying down and can easily find them, but still a noteworthy.

Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. It has only been 6 weeks so I will update later should something drastic happen but for what I need them for -workouts and activities that are unsuitable for my headphones, these are great.

The Jabra App is pretty cool too letting me customize i.e. how much sound I want to be piped in with the hear-through feature.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants something less obtrusive than the Air-Pods, that still has great connectivity and better sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_268?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=268&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd been looking for an in-ear wireless solution that was sleek and would stay in my ears while running or working out.  The great reviews from the wirecutter and on amazon had me convinced that these were my solution.  However, it didn't take long for the problems to surface.  My biggest problem was that these hurt your ears.  I tried all of the different attachments but could never find something comfortable.  Generally, I would run for the first mile with no problems but by mile 2 I had to take them out cause they were giving me such a bad ear ache.  The same tended to be true at the end of a workout.  Having them in too long just got too uncomfortable for the compact design to be worth it.  My second major complaint ended up being the sound quality.  After 5-7 uses the audio started to get crackley.  Pretty soon they sounded more like a $40 set.  Better to pay up for the Bose wireless or the Platronics wrap arounds if you are a bit more price sensitive and don't mind the aesthetic.  Might be that these just didn't work for my ears but I can't recommend at this point.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the original Samsung Iconix which was nice but the battery life was horrible but everything else was superb. I saw where the Jabra gave you 5 hours of battery life plus two full charges so I decided to give them a try. The sound quality is very good, not great. If you like ""heavy bass"" with your music then these might let you down but for ""in ear earbuds"" they sound very good. The build quality is excellent, so far they feel great in my ear and I have yet to suffer from ""ear fatigue."" The case does not ""easily pop open"" like others suggest but the air buds themselves are not magnetic so when you do open the case be careful they do not fall out. To help with the sound quality I recommend you down load the Jabra app which allows you to play with the EQ settings and enhance the sound.

I work out almost daily, often running (4-5 miles at a time). Having secure, durable and good sounding headphones are a must. These don't shift in the ear, have solid sound and good connectivity. The included charging case is awesome and they work well making phone calls. I also have a pair of Jaybird X2s which were good, but the Jabras have better sound and connectivity.

A recommendation, install BOTH the jabra sound+ and Jabra utility for the headphones prior to pairing. You can do it either way but it helps to have that up and running first. The sound+ sometimes takes a bit of time to recongize the buds are connected so just don't get impatient. These are really strong workout and everyday headphones (great on planes too). Noise cancelling isn't amazing but they aren't dedicated for that so I didn't care (I have over ear headphones for that need).

If you need a strong, truly wireless set of ear phones you can work out in, this is the best I know of right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_314?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=314&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality sounds fantastic and surprisingly bassy for how small they are. The microphone and overall call quality is good, too. I've never had someone complain about not being able to hear me and their voices come through loud and clear. The battery life is pretty good and the ergonomics are great (for me anyways, they might not be the best for people with really small ears). The earbuds sit in your ear canal and don't jut out too far past the side of your head (like the Bose Soundsport Free does). The overall package is pretty compact for what you get especially when compared to something like the Bose Soundsport Free.

My two complaints are:
a) The Charging Case: the charging case is hard to open at times, there aren't magnets to hold the earbuds in place when the case is opened, and the hinge feels kind of weak.
b) Dropouts: at times the audio stutters for a second or drops out for a second.

Pros:
- True wireless
- Nice design and materials
- Good sound quality and noise isolation

Cons:
- Left bud drops out constantly
- ""Hear Through"" mode is full of static and can only be enabled from the app
- Sound problems when wearing winter clothes
- Battery life
- Enabling all features requires 2 persistent notifications on Android

I'm never able to get a consistent, uninterrupted connection. The sound in the left earbud drops out for a moment at erratic intervals, which I find distracting. This never happened with my Samsung U Flex that cost less than half the price of the Jabras.

When wearing a beanie or hood, there's constant sound from the material rubbing on the earbuds, which I've never experienced with other headphones.

These support ""Hear Through"" mode, which (in theory) solves a major issue with true wireless earbuds. Taking them out to have a conversation is fiddly and annoying, so hearing through them would solve that. Except it can only be enabled from within the application and fills the audio with static. The end result is that keeping it enabled all the time makes the sound quality unbearable and enabling it on the fly is even more fiddly and awkward than taking out the earbuds. The neck loop form factor allows easy removal of one or both ear buds without having to worry about holding them or putting them back in a case.

For some reason, Jabra has 2 separate Android applications (Jabra Service and Jabra Sound+) that both have to be installed to use all features. Both applications have a persistent notification. The notification for Sound+ has the convenience factor of opening settings when tapped, but the Jabra Service notification does nothing. I find this to be cluttered.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The charging case for example stopped turning off the headphones because the magnets on the inside became dislodged.  Okay no problem I took it apart and fixed it.  Now for no reason at all the left earbud stopped working.  Shortly after the right one started getting fuzzy and they are basically unusable now.  For $160 I expected better quality.

The only thing I didn't like about them was that there was a pounding noise when I walked (and especially when I ran). I got used to the pounding while walking, but not the pounding while running.

After about four months, they started behaving oddly. If I put them in the case after using them, they stayed connected to my phone. They also stopped turning on when I took them out of the case, so I had to hold down the power button to turn them on. Then the left one stopped working altogether.

I contacted customer support and told them about my problems. They asked me to try a few things, and but the problems persisted. They told me to fill out a warranty-request form, which I did. After a week, I didn't hear back from them. I sent them four follow-up emails, and they didn't respond to any of them. I was courteous and did everything they suggested.

As a last-ditch effort, I told them that I would write a critical review if they didn't respond to my messages.

Lets start with the bad stuff first.
1. The case. I have a hard time opening the case. It's very slipery yet very secure.
2. Left ear piece tends to die faster on me. Not sure why.

Pros:
1. Sound quality- like the fact you can actually mess around with the sound options through the Jabra app.
2. Able to remove one ear piece and still be able to listen to your music through the right ear piece.
3. The right price. I was very close to buying the Bose sound sport true wireless head phones as they were on sale but found the Jabra elite to be more affordable. With slightly more features than the Bose.

4. The right fit. The ear pieace is quite small, unlike other brands, to me this is a plus. They stay in place.
5. Noise cancellation. These wireless headphones do keep the outside noice while listening to music. I was actually driving with my windows rolles down and did not notice the sound of the outside world.
6. Call quality. Amazing sound quality on both ends. People on the other line have no trouble listening to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_313?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=313&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can immediately tell this casing is lower quality. CASE IS HARD to OPEN.
Then the sound quality reminds me of old Logitech speakers in my grandma's office. Horrible. Especially when I just tried Bose.
Then I read the description and nowhere does it say it is for music listening.

It just won't turn on. However, when I only put the right earbud on the charging case, the charging case LED still lights up a green light, so somehow the case is able to read the battery of an earbud that won't work. The left earbud flashes green light so I guess it does not have any issue. At the price of 186 $ I expect high quality earbuds and a better after-sales service.

- sufficiently long battery life
- no Bluetooth connectivity issues so far, even in my downtown area
- music pause feature when you take one earbud off
- mic quality in a quiet location; people told me calls are clear
- button layout
- iPhone app
- voice prompt

Okay:
- sound quality (very good compared to sub-$100 earbuds, but it cannot compete with my Bose QC20 and Xiaomi, both of which have wires)

Con:
- weak noise cancellation for phone calls; people told me they can hear street noise and my steps if I am walking; the 4-mic array is not good enough
- cannot be shared by two people (one earbud in each person) because the two earbuds only work within the distance between your left and right ears
- no active denoising (to be fair, even Bose is not offering this feature yet on their true wireless earbuds)

The Active 65t has come the closest fulfilling all of those requirements.

The fit is very secure and provides a great seal for noise isolation. The sound quality is very good for both music and calls and I love that I can wear only the right earbud when I just want to have it available for hands free calls and Siri. There is a several second delay when bringing up Siri and executing commands done through the earbud. I have found that to be the case with other Bluetooth connected earbuds as well.
The left earbud controls volume, when listening to music the only other control is skipping a track.

The charging case is very compact, 2 1/2” x 2” x 1”; with a tiny LED light that shows battery level of the case at a glance, and another inside the case to show the level of the earbud charge. Conveniently they automatically shut off when storing in the case and turn on when I take them out. Reconnecting with the phone is very quick.

The Jabra Sound app allows you to customize settings for including music equalizer for 4 different scenarios; music and calls, commuting, focusing for concentration and activity like running and walking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll try to answer that for you.","After a long search for a decent true wireless earbud setup I think these are by far the best sounding wireless earbuds I have ever used. I am an audiophile for bass, and I have used some of the best in ear monitors over the years. So this review is to clear some things up about how the bass quality is with these wireless earbuds. Personally my favorite in ear monitors are the Sony XB90ex Extra Bass, these by far hit the hardest. The bass would actually make my vision blurry at times because of how much vibrations were going through my head. I would also like to throw out there that I also own and use the Sony MDR-EX800ST In ear monitor. The XB90ex and the EX800ST both hit very hard when the bass drops and are by far the best for Bass heads like me. Now with that being said, the Jabra Elite 65t are nowhere comparable to the Sonys that I mentioned above when it comes to how hard they hit, but I can say that the Jabra is the closest wireless earbuds to them. If you are a bass head like me, I would highly suggest the Jabra Elite 65t. I also want to mention that it is best to pair your earbuds with the Jabra Sound+ App. The EQ is a nice feature, and good way to squeeze out a little more bass from these.  I have used these for about a few hours, I will update my review again after I get in a couple weeks of usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although this likely won't matter for most purchasers, these also didn't fit the small ears of the intended recipient. Unfortunately they were otherwise worthless due to lack of basic-level audio quality. These have no business being priced anywhere near Apple Airpods.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a Pixel 2 XL and needed some wireless earbuds for work and the gym and decided to try the Jabra Elite 65t.

Pros:
Extremely well built and durable. They say they are just sweatproof, but man I unknowingly knocked on of the earbuds into a sink filled with water and final fished it our after searching the whole house after 12 hours. The earbud was floating face down. My stomach dropped because I just knew it was ruined. I dried it for and turned it back on after 30 mins and it worked perfectly without any loss of sound quality. I was blown away. Besides that the sound quality is very good. I'm no audiophile, but I like hiphop and rnb and these have nice rich bass and sounds very clear.

Cons:
My biggest issue from these earbuds is that right earbud is the only one that can be used independently. I like to leave just one earbud in my ear at work to be aware of my surroundings and I wish I could have the left earbud in and my right ear free. I get around this by putting the right earbud in my left ear. It's upside down, but still fits snug, albeit goofy looking. I fear this will lead to my right earbuds battery wearing out faster that the left. I wish the charging case was usb c and I wish the battery life of the case and earbuds were a little longer.  Also, when I play PUBG mobile there is a half second audio delay. Fortunately I don't experience and audio delays watch YouTube, Netflix, Instagram, etc.

Overall these are good earbuds. Jabra has left themselves some room to really improve these earbuds in the future, but I have no problem recommending this product. Hopefully some of my issues can be fixed in software updates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_314?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=314&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far I'm not impressed. The set-up process was fairly simple, and the sound quality is passable.
However, the companion app that goes with the headphones is utter garbage. The app is sluggish and has next to no practical uses besides updating the headphones every now and again. But Jabra can't even seem to install firmware updates properly on their headphones. I had used the headphones ONCE without any problems (right after I had taken them out of the box), and then I decided to install the Jabra app and install the latest firmware update to the earbuds.
To my surprise, the update made the audio in the right ear so quiet that it's practically inaudible. I've searched all across the internet and even contacted support about this issue and there seems to be no reliable fix to this annoying problem. So for now I am stuck with earbuds that pretty much only work in one ear. Thanks Jabra.

TLDR - Companion app and customer support sucks. Firmware updates only seem to break the earbuds. One earbud is constantly louder than the other. Would absolutely not recommend.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1.  It took me at least 30 secs just to open the charging case.... no kidding, it's just soooo hard to open the first time... subsequent attempts are much easier though.

2. Connecting to bluetooth was smooth and easy, however, connecting to Jabra Sound+ is really a daunting task to say at least.... i am using Huawei Mate 9 and Jabra isn't built for that!  Always got error ""Jabra service was not started, please configure your phone settings to allow it run in background""... fine, i am handy guy and able to solve this problem myself, two hours later.... while i am working on getting Jabra service to run at Huawei background, i keep earbuds in my ears and enjoyed music. I have to say that sound quality was great... though passing through feature is kind of over-advertized feature. Video playback is great, no visible delays. Overall, i love the sound quality. music  was great!

3. Then ... start feeling something wrong with my ear....Oh dear, it hurts... maybe it's just my ears.. but i can literally feel the swelling in my ear canal. i have changed the smallest earbuds but still hurts alot. it's a shame that i loved the sound quality , the build , the everything about this earbuds but it hurts... looks like this high-tech earbuds is on its way back to Amazon...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I kept looking at Apple AirPods, but their form factor fits so poorly in my ears that I'm afraid they would fall out. Plus they look consummately dorky. These things come in their own tiny charging case, like the AirPods, and they have sized flanges, which make them a perfect fit for me. The sound quality, both for calls and for listening to music, podcasts, etc. is outstanding...and adjustable through a graphic equalizer on the companion app, which also lets you set the level of ""hear-through"" of ambient sound for three separate use cases — working, commuting, and working out.

For plains and trains, they're great. Love the sound, not tinny at all. However -- and it's a big however -- when I work out, sweat really impedes the sound quality. I've had them for about five months, I've tried each of the different-sized plastic tips, but with each one, sweat gets in between the tip and my ear and the music sounds like I'm underwater, or listening in the next room. These are my first true wireless earbuds, but I've never had this problem with wired buds.

The fit is great, they stay in fine. But I bought them specifically for running and I'm left with so-so results.

Anyone else having this problem?

-----------

UPDATE:
Jabra customer service was great. They had me try a few workarounds to fix the issue. Ultimately, nothing changed, so they sent me a replacement pair, which is great. I really appreciate the customer service.

However... The new earbuds will not pair with anything other than my iPod. Not my iPhone, not my iPad. So the only thing it works with is the product Apple has phased out. (The original earbuds worked with the phone and tablet.)

Prior to my original purchase, I had read that the Jabras were the best for running/working out, but the lack of flexibility is frustrating. I'm thinking that going with the Apple AirPods would have been the smart decision.

Bottom line - know what you're using these for and what you hope to use them for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The concept and idea of a “total free” headphones is fantastic, however, Jabra customer support has been the WORST that I have ever experience.

Yesterday I was finally given the option to return the item and get a replacement, however, since I purchased my headphones in Amazon, I need to go through a new customer support process now with Amazon and only God knows how much time and money I will need to waste to get a replacement.

I use these for work calls at my home office desk for 1-4 hours a day. Other than that, they are in their case on top of my desk. I would say they don't get used or abused. While on my first call this morning the right ear bud popped and then had a dramatic decrease in volume. I pretty much cannot hear out of it. Hoping Jabra will replace again and that it doesn't take them 40 days to do so, like last time. I had high hopes for these. My wife and kids have some $14 MPOW bluetooth headphones that get abused, left outside and all that and they work a million times better than these overpriced Jabra units. Maybe I need to make that switch if Jabra won't replace. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THESE!!!

UPDATE: almost 40 days after placing my warranty request with Jabra, I have a good, working headset. Jabra sent me a whole new set, instead of just replacing my right earbud. I had to send in my old earbuds and charging case before they sent me my new unit. I imagine this process would have taken less than 40 days but it seems Jabra forgot about me several times through the process. I had to call in several times to prod this request along. I was told that the person in charge of my ticket was ""on vacation"" one time. Another time I was told the person in charge of my ticket just forgot to get back to me. Either way, I am happy with my new earbuds. The first set, while new, never sounded good. I read all of these reviews and could not figure out why people rated these things so high. It seems my first set was a dud from the get go. This new set sounds completely different, powerful, smooth and even some bass. I am hoping they can last.

UPDATE: 4 months in and the right ear bud plays @ 10% volume. After trying all of their suggested fixes, nothing helped. I just contacted support to see about a resolution, hope they can do something about this. I have read that a ton of buyers experience this same issue. I use these very lightly so 4 months of use and $170 bucks really sucks. Missing my cheap Apple knockoff wired ear buds right now.

I bought these explicitly for phone calls. I have used wired and wireless headsets in the past. I dislike using single ear headsets because they tend to make me dizzy after a long day of calls. These ear buds are exactly what I have needed. I tried a lot of cheaper items en route to these ear buds and there is no comparison. If I rate these based on phone call quality, it's 5 stars. If I bought these for music, I would rate 1 star. I would prefer any of my other headsets for music, including $10 wired ear buds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So,  I could get the regular Jabra elites by Monday because they don’t have that disclaimer, but these would take longer. I use my earbuds in the gym, and I sweat. A lot. So the Actives seemed like the way to go. If you aren’t crazy about the blue/copper finish of the buds listed on Amazon, just know the ones at the brick and mortar store are a more conservative matte black and brushed silver.

Pairing these could not have been any easier- I paired them with my iPhone 7 plus while I was waiting for my In n Out burger order- the hardest part was getting the packaging open. From there it took about 45 seconds to download the Jabra app, and as soon as I powered the buds on, they were connected. The sound is really good, and they’re comfortable. I’ve had them in for about three hours now and no issues. Bass won’t blow you away, but compared to my old Plantronics, it’s a huge step up. Overall sound is very clean and immersive.

The Active buds have a grippy matte finish and were easy to put in my ears. They don’t feel like there’s any chance of them falling out. For me, the medium gels that are installed on the buds out of the box was perfect, but they also pack large and small gels.

The Jabra Sound + app is fairly intuitive, with equalizer settings,  something called Hear Through that lets you decide if you want these to be noise cancelling or not, an option for step counting that another reviewer mentioned made the battery life slightly worse than the regular Actives, and one that I won’t use (that’s what my Apple Watch is for)- thankfully you can toggle it on or off via the app. A feature I think I’ll really get some use out of is a choice of several ‘soundscapes’, from white noise to waterfall, thunderstorm, diving, etc. also included is an option to integrate with Alexa, which I think I’ll pass on- not crazy about something constantly listening to me.

My only gripe so far is with the mini USB charging cord. This is old technology. Plus the supplied cord is maybe 6” long at best.

I can’t speak to battery life yet, but these are going strong 3 hours out of the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kinda bad","Let’s start with the good. They have really good sound for earbuds. Bass is solid and audio is clear. The “hear through” mode is pretty cool too. Good for working or running in busy areas. They connect easy and have good distance.

Now for the bad.
The headphones have some firmware issues that should be easily fixable but jabra refuses to do so. The audio is stronger in the left unit than the right.i suppose this can be fixed by altering the audio settings on your device but that makes the headphones that more annoying. There is also a noticeable hissing noise in the left earbud that can be very annoying at times. They tend to cut out at random times And in order for the headphones to work, they have to be within 8 inches of each other so forget about you and a friend sharing the buds unless you want to be very close to each other. You can however use just the right unit without the left but that’s only really good for phone calls. Also the button placement makes it so when you press any button on the devices, you’re shoving the earbuds into your ears and that makes them very uncomfortable.

All in all. Not horrible, but definitely not great. My advice is to stick with the connected wireless earbuds until true wireless gets a little better. Or maybe spend a little more money and get Galaxie buddies or wait for the new Powerbeats to come out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recently bought a pair of Bose and had to return them for inadequate sound and poor fit...so, why am I returning these? Well, let me tell you! The pairing is crap. Before I get into it too much let me give a few pros, because my con may not hinder some buyers.

PROS:
Sound quality is superb.
The app is awesome and offers some great added features and a lot of customization.
The hear through function is nice for the ladies who want to listen with both ears and take a walk. I really loved that function.

CONS (and the only reason I'm returning them):
The pairing is bizarre and poor.

To elaborate on the pairing issue that broke the deal for me--if you don't select the option in the app that allows for one earbud to be used at a time then when you take one ear bud out the other stops. Not too bad of a problem it would seem if you get to select it away, but the only one that works with this is the right ear bud. If you take the right one out the left one quits. I'm not kidding either. If you move the right one from your ear to the palm of your hand the left one stops. Completely annoying, because sometimes I want to give an ear a break, and sometimes that may be my right ear.

The other pairing issue that killed it was when I was in a 500 sqft. apartment where separation from room-to-room was barely anything and they kept dropping off and on. I couldn't even leave my phone in the middle of the apartment and go into other rooms with doors open without them doing it; I felt equally as tethered as having a corded pair.  Hence, they must be returned.

Sorry Jabra, but the whole point of having wireless is so you can actually BE wireless.  For at least a few feet in radius anyway. You nailed the sound, but failed the pairing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They fit me well and the audio is good enough. I loved the Hear Through feature so that when the noise isolation is not desired, I can hear things around me. The left and right sync is solid. The connection to the phone is solid. Call quality in both directions is solid. The initial impression had been that these were solid and they became my go-to earbuds.

Unfortunately, after less than a year of use, the audio on the right earbud has started to fail. With it being the master, it still connects up fine and I can hear through the left earbud, but the right audio is nearly dead. I've done a great deal of troubleshooting and came to the conclusion that I need to execute the warranty.

And this is where the next problem appears to come up. Because it's not an enterprise product, I can't seem to figure out how to execute the 1 year limited warranty plus 2 year dust and moisture warranty. I've opened a support request, but usually when one has to approach this through a nebulous support request system such as what Jabra runs, it takes a long time to execute a warranty, and the 1 year part of it almost up. We'll see how it goes, I just hope I didn't only get 11 months out of my expensive earbuds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The size and appearance of the earbuds are the best I've seen of any fully wireless set. Most other people I've seen use either Apple Air Pods (which make you look a little like a dweeb) or the Bose Soundsport Free (which jut out of the ears extensively). I wouldn't say that either set necessarily looks bad, but the Elite Active 65t squeezes all the same specs in a smaller form. It's closer to the Bose in shape, but more compact and sits mostly in the outer ear opening with minimal protrusion. The buds themselves are very lightweight, and I rarely notice them when I'm working out. The earbuds also have a slightly grippy texture, which helps them stay in your ear when you get sweaty. Speaking of sweat, these buds are IP56 rated to resist dust and sweat, unlike the Air Pods (which were designed with hipster cafes in mind, not sweaty gyms). The charging case is another example of good design; it has the same grippy texture as the earbuds (unlike the slick Air Pod charging case), while maintaining a fairly compact size (similar to a thicker box of Tic Tacs, unlike the Bose case which is the approximate size of a police flashlight). The only thing that could be better are the buttons; the left bud is host to a volume up and down button (oriented horizontally for some reason), while the right bud has a multifunction button. While this is certainly better than the Air Pods' single touch button, the Bose buttons are better designed, situated on the outside edge of the buds which makes them easier to press. The cobalt and gold color scheme is sure to be polarizing, but I think it looks good. Besides, if you're that worried about your headphones matching your outfit in the gym, you need to rethink your priorities.

Battery life is equivalent to most other fully wireless sets (5 hours plus 2 full recharges from the case). Since I really only use them for 1-2 hours at a time, I can't attest to the accuracy of those numbers. They usually last about 10-12 workouts before I have to recharge the buds and the case. Overall, I'd say the battery life is plenty good for the intended purpose. If you're looking for wireless headphones for travel or business usage, I'd recommend travelers get a set of Bluetooth noise canceling headphones (like the offerings from Bose and Sony, which last around 20-30 hours) or a dedicated Bluetooth headset for the businesspeople.

The sound quality is another plus. This is a fully in-ear bud, which means that there isn't any sound leakage. This also provides a degree of passive noise-canceling, which is nice when the beanpole in the power rack next to you is screaming while pulling 135 with a back like a hissing black cat on Halloween. The HearThrough mode, which can be activated by double-pressing the button on the right bud, allows outside noise to filter in via the microphones. This is handy if you're running or doing another activity that requires you to be aware of your surroundings. Music playback quality is surprisingly good; it certainly won't win any awards, but the sound includes a decent amount of detail and doesn't feel compressed or airy. This is partially due to the in-ear nature of the buds (unlike the on-ear nature of Air Pods and Bose), but overall it's pretty good. The call quality is good as well. When I've taken calls with these the listener never had any complaints or had to repeat myself. Additionally, the Bluetooth connection is very strong. I haven't had either bud drop out while in use, even through walls. This is a bit better than what I've heard about the Soundsport Frees, which are still solid but tend to drop out every so often.

There are a few other interesting features. Music pauses automatically if you remove a bud, which allows you to talk to people trying to steal your bench while you're making a trip to the water fountain. Holding the right button brings up your phone's assistant, which is probably handy if you have an Android phone. I'm stuck with Siri, however, so I don't tend to use it. These buds also include 3 sizes of ear tips so that you can get a comfortable and secure fit. I was having mixed results with the default medium tips, but swapped them for the smalls and experienced a much more secure and comfortable fit (apparently, size DOES matter).

There are a few things that could be improved. You can use a single bud to listen to music and make calls, but only the right one. This is sure to annoy the lefties out there. Additionally, while the in-ear tips are fairly secure, they've come loose on a few occasions while performing intense activities (mostly barbell complexes and the rower). It would've been nice to have the ear clips like the Bose to prevent this. The Bluetooth connection, while rock solid, seems to have trouble switching between devices. I usually use them with my Apple watch, but I forgot it one day and had to connect them to my phone. Even in sync mode, these phones had trouble pairing. I had to forget the device on my phone and re-pair them to get a connection. This isn't the only pair of headphones to do that, though, so it might be an issue with my phone/watch.

Overall, these are perfect for use as gym headphones as well as being great headphones in general. While there are a couple of minor issues, they are vastly outweighed by the good desing, great sound, and battery life these buds provide. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I called and was on hold for ~45 minutes. The guy who answered made me do a firmware update and told me to factory reset before I could do an RMA, then he hung up, saying that he sent me an email that I could use if I still wanted to return them. Still had the problem (because hardware problems aren't solved by resets). Sent him a few emails before I heard from Jabra. They had me fill out another form and about a week later told me to send them in for review before they'd do anything else. That was a week ago.

I'm sure this would differ from person to person. My wife has the Samsung Iconx 2018.
I think both are great earbuds, and the fit was the only thing I was really choosing between. I would say for myself, I felt slightly more overall pressure from the Iconx frame (not in the ear canal, and not quite to the point of discomfort), but the Iconx also had a smaller profile while wearing, so kinda makes sense. The Jabra's didn't have as much pressure, but the ""V"" created by the external Mics pinched the area where it overlapped. For myself, this left the Iconx's more comfortable overall. IF it wasn't for the pain from mics squeezing the ear, I would have probably gone with these in terms of comfort. I think people would be happy with either choice. For myself, I'm still preferring the Iconx.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Connect Jabra to 2 device (Dell and iPhone) simultaneously - I can play songs on my phone and it pauses and plays back again whenever there are notifications or after playing video clips on the laptop. I also tried playing videos/songs on the laptop and I can still use the call answering functions for the connected phone.
2. Accidentally dropping the right earbud on a concrete floor, about 4 ft high - had no problems after | water splashes from washing my face or sweat during workouts - still functions the same, no problems encountered
3. Specs-wise: 5hr battery life (Verified-if used non-stop); 10m bluetooth operating range (verified, I tried it to up to 2m more). I ahve adjusted the fitting of each bud on each ear so I can use the buttons easily.
>Functions I appreciate and use often: auto pause; passive noise cancellation; hear through; Soundscape; music equalizer.
>Things I can work around: prolonged use (6Hrs), start to feel the weight of the buds on my ear - learned to adjust the use time. The make of the charging case, I just have to be extra careful on opening and taking out the buds.

Everything about them screams quality and well thought out approach to quality. My problem is that they never worked properly. The audio, particularly when working out on my treadmill would cut in and out. They were fully updated, fully charged, and inserted properly. For this price point, this is completely unacceptable.

I purchased them elsewhere, which was a mixed blessing. I recently had the experience here of being unable to return something to a non Amazon vendor. The price here was the same. I went with the Bose Sound Sport, which is cheaper, and works. The design while not as sleek, seems to work more easily.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is excellent for sure, and well balanced in all ranges. However, I thought that the EQ in the app gave it some distortion when I set it to anything but flat. They provide great noise isolation especially in a noisy place like the gym. The sound thru feature is a cool added bonus when you want it. The final positive for these earbuds is how small and discreet they look in your ears. They don't stick out at all and look great.

Now with the negatives. Like others have pointed out, the left earbud had an annoying static hiss which is a serious problem at low volumes and should not be an issue with earphones at this price range. I'm guessing it's a quality control issue because some people don't have this problem.  Additionally, these are VERY uncomfortable to wear. Some review sites mentioned that the fit is not for everyone, and that is truly the case for me. Inserting them in is actually painful and they become uncomfortable (rather than painful) as I wore them for long periods. But if you use the volume controls it again becomes painful since your pressing on your ear.

Overall I can't recommend these because of the static hiss issue and that they are uncomfortable for me despite the great sound and noise isolation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them 8 hours a day, every single day. Their design and fit is perfect for my ears and I often time forget that I'm wearing them.

So why the 3 stars if I like them so much? While I find the quick charge on these incredibly convenient t given that I use them so intensively, after a year of use the battery holds about 3 hours of charge per charge. It's particularly annoying when you are really getting in the groove while working and you have to stop what you're doing to put them away in their case so they can recharge. Note, I'm getting 3 hours using just the right ear bud, when I use both I can count on getting maybe 2 and a half hours at most.

So, ok maybe I'm a bit of a power user when it comes to these things right? It would probably be fine for most users right? Wrong. The other main downfall of these is that after these latest updates (yes ladies and gentlemen you get software updates for your ear buds smh), if you stop the music or video playing you'll get really loud annoying alerts from the ear buds announcing that it's disconnected and reconnected to your phone about every 5 to 15 minutes. Sometimes I'll pause them while I attend to my customer or my coworker and it is incredibly jarring to have them suddenly announce their presense in your ear when you were in the middle of a conversation. I don't see why they had to make it such a jarring alert. I get it, you want to test the connection with the phone since the audio has stopped but I don't need you telling me that you're doing that every 5 minutes. I sincerely hope that they remove that function in future updates.

The case that comes with these ear buds can sure take a punch. I have accidently dropped this case I don't know how many times and it's only released my ear buds a few times at most. I can appreciate a secure fit. But that they had to use the flimsiest plastic latch to hold the ear buds in has already shown its weakness. Just last week, I opened the case carefully, as I always do and the little tab that holds the case closed broke on me. Allow me to emphasize, I have dropped this case quite a few times but the time that it chose to break was when I opened it carefully? That really set my day off to a poor start. Worst part is that the replacement case cost almost $70. I'm using a rubber band now but I'm severely disappointed.

Saving the worst for last, let talk about my biggest gripe with these. The Bluetooth connectivity range. My God, the range on these is God awful. Ill be working (I work a physically laborious job) and these puppies will cut out on me every once in a while. Soon as I step outside I might as well put them away. What's the point of having ear buds designed with athletes and physically active people in mind when you literally have to hold your phone up to your ears to get a stable connection. I didn't pay what paid for these for this much of an inconvenience in my work flow. I've had more than a few poor Bluetooth connective ear buds but these take the cake.

So after my little rant, what could you take away from this? Honestly if you want an excelent sounding truly wireless earbud, these are the ones yoh have been looking for. It's not fair to compare these to full headphones but they can sure hold their own. They dont fall out and they are incredibly comfortable. But if you are a power user like myself and use these for any more than 2 hours at a time, I have a hard time pushing you to buy these. They lose that premium feel to them once you experience my gripes up above and become a very expensive inconvenience. I'll be using these until they eventually die on me but I don't think I'll be buying any future installments from jabra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can play my music while I wait in line for a coffee and when it is time to order, I just click the right bud, my music turns off and I can actually hear the barista better with the earbud in than I could without the buds in.

These fall short of perfection for a few reasons that are probably personal to me.

On the plus side:

The sound quality is great. I think they have a nice tone, with a good amount of bass. Music doesn't come through tinny.

They hold a charge for quite a long time.

The buttons are easy to access for phone calls, and the mic works well.

Even with music on, I'm able to hear enough to notice if someone is speaking to me or if there is something going on that I need to hear.

The flaws:

I find them uncomfortable. The longest I can wear them is about 30 minutes. By then, my ears are aching. This isn't solved by changing the rubber tips. They're just too bulky and heavy for my ear canal.

The range isn't great. I use earbuds a lot at home, streaming from my laptop. I get up to do something in another room, and I notice a weird static.

For some reason, these will not stay paired to my devices. I've tried my cellphone and two laptops. They stay paired fine as long as I want during a single use. But, when I turn them off, they lose the pairing. My device will still list them as paired, but the earbuds won't work. The voice will keep telling me to connect them. The only way to get them to work again is to remove them from the device and add them again. It only takes a few seconds, but it's annoying. I have no need for the app. It just seems like one more app that only takes up space, because I can do everything I need to do without it. I mean, seriously, I'm apped out. I don't know if this is why the earbuds won't stay paired. Maybe the app has to be installed on the device in order for it to work continuously.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_409?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=409&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This will progress until one ear is almost completely silent. I find if I leave the headphones alone for 24 hours it will go back to normal but that means you can only listen to a half hour of music a day. This problem is so severe I consider it a defect rather than a flaw so I exchanged them but the second pair I got is having exactly the same issues. The other problem I have is that the earbuds keep falling out. I've tried all three of the silicone earbud attachments and none of them fix the problem. I'm just sitting still when this happens and these are meant for exercise. I can't imagine even trying to go for a walk with these. Overall these are unusable headphones that I feel I pretty much wasted my money on.

Update: just checked Jabra on better business beaureau after I noticed a pattern in low reviews here. They have two listings both of which BBB thinks are out of business because mail was returned to sender. There are recent complaints that are unresolved because BBB thinks the company has gone out of business.

I should know.","My wife got me these wonderful earbuds as a particularly kind and thoughtful birthday gift. They sound wonderful, and while they don't _entirely_ fit my weirdly shaped ears -- the right one can start to hurt a bit after an hour or so, and occasionally falls out while I'm doing sit-ups, if I'm not careful -- overall they're very good in and of themselves, and immensely better than the janky wired headphones I previously had.

So, of course, having been given this wonderful and expensive gift by the woman I love, within a month I'd run them through the washer.

And the dryer.

Yep. Left them in my pocket after working out. Completely forgot about them. Wondered, idly, what that odd rattling sound was in the washer. Found out when I opened the dryer to find one of them sitting there, silently accusing me.

So, am I writing this review about my second pair? Nope. The only trauma the earbuds suffered from a full wash and dry cycle was running out of battery charge. I popped them into the charging case, prayed to the technology gods, and with a few hours' recharging, they were good as new. No drop in sound quality or connection ability, even.

Do I recommend that you, too, launder these very expensive earbuds, on purpose or by accident? Most emphatically not. But should you prove as forgetful as I was, rest assured that this _very_ well-made set of earbuds may well be able to survive your carelessness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also found for what ever reason Amazon music sounds better than u tube music, also you must listen to different music and maybe some short comedy clips and so on to actually appreciate the sound, because some of the music i listened to sounded tinny so it's not the jabra it's that particular song. I pulled the trigger on these because I didn't want to buy a cheap pair and didn't want to buy a pair for 300 dollars so these fell in the middle for 150 bucks and I am happy I know I didn't make a mistake with these. You also get a 2 year warranty with these when u register them against water and dust, I also bought the 4 year warranty for 15 bucks so I'm covered no matter what. Just like many people I am skeptical of other reviews some fake and some real , so just like the jabra they are really sweet and the real deal so IF u purchase these you will be  confident you got a great deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While the sound quality on these is not really bad, if you are paying attention to the music these are not really good.  The midrange on these is mushy/muddy.  The lows and highs are not too dissimilar from Airpods but compared to B&O, which has the best sound on the market for earbuds, the lows on these are just not good.

Even at low volume, the noise canceling is not bad at all.

If you are wearing these while you watch videos you will not be happy.  When tested with an iPhone 7 Plus, there is a small but clearly noticeable lag between the video and audio.  These are flat out bad for watching anything with people talking.

On the plus side these are almost as easy to set-up as Airpods and they are far superior to the initial setup with B&O.

The Jabra app is good. It walks you through the setup and has a useful little manual.  The app makes updating the firmware a breeze.  It does have an equalizer that helps deal with the weakness on the low end but forget hearing the real lows that you get with B&O or good full sized headphones.

The one place where these are superior is comfort/stability for working out.  These have three different sized tips so they are as secure as B&O and far more stable than Airpods.  So, if you want something to use when you jog (and AirPods fall out of your ears) and you don't want to drop $275 for B&O these are the way to go.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good bass and clear treble at all volumes.  I have never run out of battery using them for music at the gym (90+ minutes) and on phone calls (60+ minutes).  I have only a couple complaints.  I have tried all the different size ear gels and the medium size fits best.  If you go too big or small the audio quality suffers.  The medium is best but still requires frequent adjustments during gym workouts.  This sounds strange but I find them to be slippery.  I have to be careful as I have dropped them numerous times.  Also the case is slippery and takes finesse to put the buds in and out without dropping buds and/or case.  I have never experienced any of the connection drop outs other describe.  Although they have microphones in them to allow the ""HearThrough"" feature I still feel like I have to yell to speak.

(and does not hurt my ear)","The Jabras work great in general and for my use of them (I mostly use it for phone calls and I only use the right earbud); they hold a charge and the sound quality is great-- both in terms of the audio and the call microphone. Also, they fit in my ear painlessly and snugly even though I have small ears (e.g. I cannot wear apple products because the part that goes into the inside part of the ear is way too big and hurts way too much, and although I love my rowkin wireless earbud its sharp edges kind of hurt my ear too so I can only wear it for about 30ish minutes at a time; in contrast, the Jabras fit comfortably! they are larger - in that they fill the whole 'ear pocket' (to make up a term for the medium indented part of your ear!)- but the part that goes into the inside part of the ear is smaller and comes with a few sizes of rubber tips to fit different sizes).  By removing those dang cords from my phone calls this tiny practical improvement puts a smile on my face! In short: I recommend this highly if you want a quick tiny improvement to the day to day annoyance of the cord-tangle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_323?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=323&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've used them to listen to music sitting at my desk at work and I've worn them to the gym several times.

What I Like:
1. The buttons - you can control almost everything you need from the buttons on the earbuds.
2. Battery Life - I don't have to recharge them through the day, I just put them in the case when I'm done and the next day they're charged and ready to go.
3. Sound/Fit - 3 different sizes of silicon tips are included and it's important to use the size that fits best.  I suspect that people who complain that these have no bass are using the wrong size.  I tried the smaller set and I had no bass and tinny, the largest ones were uncomfortable for my ears.  I didn't like the feeling at first, they hurt when they were in for any length of time or when I pushed the buttons, but after using them for 2 or 3 days, that is no longer an issue.
4. Auto Stop/Resume - When I take them out, my music stops, when I put them back in, it starts again.  This feature works well.
5. Call Quality - Calls sound great and I can speak in a normal voice and the person I am talking to can hear me.
6. Range - I can get pretty far from my phone (Pixel 3) before there are any connectivity issues.

What I don't like:
1. Hissing Noise - When I'm not playing music, there is an annoying hissing sound.  I've tried various internet fixes, but none of them seem to solve the issue.  For me, it's play music or take them out of my ears.
2. Hear Through - All this seems to do is add a little more noise, I don't actually hear people better with this turned on.
3. The Case - This is a nitpick, but I would rather it use a USB-C cable instead of the old micro USB.  It's my only device that uses the older cable.

Despite a few cons, I really like these earbuds.  I feel like they're the best wireless headphone option for Android at the moment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think they're excellent in regards to the features that they offer and their sound quality is really good. My main issues have been more with the physical design and how they fit my ears. The battery life seems to run a little under the five hours, which is pretty good considering their small size. Then you get an additional 10 hours with the charging case. The app that's available allows you to keep track of their charge, as well as customize a bunch of listening options. When making calls with these earbuds, the sound quality is very clear and there's not a lot of background noise that the caller hears on the other end. Again, my biggest issue is with how these earbuds fit my ears. I tried all of the different tips and can't seem to get a comfortable fit that will stay in my ears. I don't know if I just have oddly shaped ear holes that don't hold them very well, but it has been an ongoing issue for me with many earbuds. So if you're a person that typically has trouble with earbuds fitting and staying in your ears, then you might want to test these before you buy or even skip these altogether. So overall I really enjoyed the features and quality of sounds, but just can't fully embrace these with the constant ear issues that I continue to have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_416?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=416&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been turned over to some kind of special escalation person who will call me back in 1 to 2 days, which is unacceptable because at this point I have a very expensive pair of headphones that simply don’t work. It's clear the issue is with the hardware, not software but Jabra seems dedicated to making it look like I'm the problem.

The right thing to do would be to offer to ship me a replacement or some other more effective relief. Instead the company is going to make me, the paying customer, jump through hoops that our absurd.

I should have learned my lesson from my previous pair of a Jabra earbuds which also didn’t work very well after about two months. The product quality plus the customer experience have convinced me to never, ever, do business with this company again.

I've had the same pair of $20 SoundPEATS heapdhones for three years, but they finally stopped working, so even though I knew it meant I'd be broke for some time, I decided to splurge on these.
I was not only in heaven the first couple days I got them, but I also showed them off to everyone I knew. So freaking cool! Alas, this fairy tale came to an abrupt end just four days after I purchased them.
On the fourth night of ownership, I put the 100% charged earphones in and the left ear didn't come on. I turned them off. Turned them back on. Still, it didn't work. I disconnected Bluretooth and reconnected. Still, nothing. I put them back in their case and took them out again. Nothing.
I'm sure I could call Jabra and maybe even get some technical support. Maybe they'll tell me I have a defective pair and send me a replacement. Maybe, they'll tell me to return them to Best Buy and get another pair. None of this matters. Because when you drop $200 on a pair of earphones, they should NEVER stop working. No glitches for $200 earphones. No excuses. Also, how can I possibly trust another pair wouldn't do the same thing? Would you give away $200 of your hard-earned money in hopes your earphones never stop working? I wouldn't.
There is no way Jabra can regain my trust again, and a new pair would only leave me worried they'd stop working after some time.
Also, can we get back to the fact that these only worked for four days? I spent $50/day on earphones. As my three-year-old would say, ""Not nice, Jabra. Not nice!""","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_411?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=411&reviewerType=all_reviews"

RMA process is terrible","I purchased these back in May of 2018. They worked until around July when a software update made the right earbud almost silent compared to the left earbud. It's still needs to be in your ear to use, but isn't audible at all.
Some had said this could be fixed by downloading a language pack or doing hardware resets. Unfortunately, mine wasn't fixed by there steps.  I started an RMA process in November of 2018 and it was completed in 2 weeks after having to remind the tech about my problem, take multiple screenshots of the issue. Once the RMA was completed I would then be sent a new Right Earbud. Then I find out that they are on back-order. It's need 4 months and I still haven't received a working Right Earbud!

Overall, the quality and battery life of this set was great. It stays in my ears while working out and the sound quality is pretty good.

After connected to the phone, the headset sometimes goes into phone call mode (even if not making phone calls), so the music volume becomes very low.
Sometimes the headset just won't play the music even if it's connected.
At the beginning, I was happy with this product as it fits my ear very well and it looks very stylish. However, I am very disappointed now as many problems surfaced.
The customer support is not responsive at all. I got reply in 3-4 days after inquiry. And that was just a automated reply (it stated so in the email signature).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Aesthetically, they are very cool looking.  They have a built in microphone and it’s easy to take calls.  Other thoughts are:

• Easy to pair via Bluetooth with our Samsung phones.
• Requires that you download Jabra’s free App, which has many nice features.
• We love the customizable equalizer in the App.
• They are small and fit comfortably and securely in your ear.
• The fit is ideal for physical activity such as running and walking.
• There are lots of attachments for fine tuning fit on an individual basis.
• Compare to the general field, sound quality is very good.
• By fiddling with the App, you can customize the sound the way you want it.
• You can store several equalizer configurations for different types of music or effects.
• They come in a secure little case that is easy to stash in your pocket.
• The case recharges the buds when they are stored.

With the research it seemed like a safe bet to go with the Jabra Elite Active 65t. Not so.
At the same time I purchased a set of true wireless ear buds here for less than $40.00. I have had MUCH better results from the lesser cost ear buds.
1) Jabra claims to last for 5 hours. Not so. Battery goes weak after less than 5 hours, even when ear buds are not in use. The lesser cost units stay charged all day long, some times as much as 10 hours on a long work day. I have used the lesser cost units many days with frequent calls and have not had problems.
2) Jabra claims to have a very good pairing system that stays connected.  Not true. I frequently needed to take them out of my ears, place them in their charger pod, then replace them in my ears.  With the lesser cost units I have only had to do this once or twice in the history of using them. One of the times was after an extremely long day, with extreme heat. Acceptable.
3) Size. Jabra Elite has a larger body. They seem to fit well.  I found it surprising that with a larger body they couldn’t provide longer battery duration.  Frustrating.

End result?  I will likely be sending these back for a refund because they just don’t live up to the expense of nearly $200.00. I can buy 5 sets of the lesser expensive units and still have money left over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
- Super easy set up and quick connectivity once paired.
- Good mic quality for calls.
- Fit is pretty good - I like how they sit in the ear. Comfy and secure.
- The case is nice and small and easily fits in a pocket.

Cons
- Sound quality is quite bad, even for buds. just hollow and really no bass - practically un-listenable for music. This is after maxing the base in the app. The bass just isn’t there at all, even for buds. Talk/podcasts is fine, but that’s not saying much for $200 headphones.
- Inside my head ""underwater"" sound and feeling. This is probably a relic of any sealed earbuds, but my own voice, breathing, or any movement of the buds in my ears creates low-level rumbling noises (microphonics?) that are incredibly irritating and really a deal breaker. Quite irritating for a headset that's intended to be used while working out / breathing hard. Similar to the cord-drag rustling noise some headphones have.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I usually expect that actual experience will never be as great as many reviewers claim. I have ears that typically have a hard time getting most earbuds to fit in my ears securely and not hurt my ears after >5min of wear. I also struggle typically with most wireless earbuds to quickly stow them away quickly. These were surprisingly comfortable in my ears for 30+ minutes. They did start to get sore after an hour or more but by rotating their orientation in my ear slightly it usually fixed the problem (my problem spot is the back lower rim of my ear where the outer portion of most ear buds rest). I was pleasantly surprised at how well the gel tips block out noise even passively. I was used to the silicon tips that never did anything and was convinced that only the comply foam tips would work for that. I was pleasantly mistaken. They work well and provide a great seal. It was between these and the AirPods by Apple. My ears could never tolerate Apple’s style of ear buds (the Air pods use the same shape) due to soreness caused after less than 5min of wear. The sound is great. My iPhone 6s has issues with sharing these wireless earbuds with other devices (according to the threads, all iOS devices do this) so it detracts from the benefit of these being able to pair with up to 8 devices at a time. I love the ‘hear-through’ setting so I don’t have to completely tune out my work surroundings, I can just turn down the noise somewhat. They automatically turn on when pulled from the case, and turn off when returned to the case. They automatically connect to my phone effortlessly whether I’m using just the right earbud or both. Switching between using one or both ear buds has been extremely seamless as well without any bothersome connection issues. I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Use them all the time at work, around the house, and working in the yard. I haven’t used them for running yet, but I will.

I was worried that they would fall out but, after having them for over a month a using them almost daily, they have never fallen out once.

They sound great, there is no static, no delay between the two headsets.

If you want to only wear one you have to wear the right one.

The app is a good addition, lets you customize the sound you hear, either to preset sounds or customize.

The hear through function so it pulls in ambient sounds, or turn off hear through so it’s noise canceling.

First off some context, I work in both an office and outdoor setting and I wanted these to help me detangle from my old headphones.
I never want s these for working out or the gym, but I gather I'd hate them if I did.
First let's look at build quality.
I'd give the quality a 4/5 ... The headphones for me are comfy out of the box. They fit well and feel comfy. The charging block itself is strong and has fallen few times from me just not remembering where I had them and they still work and hold great charge. My only problem here is the opening of the case itself. At first I would pry it open, not know there's a push down then pull open type of setting 😂. My bad Jabra.
Sound quality 3/5
For me the sound quality on these are awesome, with great features built in to the eq to change it to your liking. My score is however is low because of my experience with them chipping out ever so often as if they're too far from the paired device. I'd literally be jamming to some tunes with it in my hands, then I put it in my pocket and it's chipping in and out. Sometimes chipping in and out while it's in my hand, guess it hates the way I dance to Migos lol. Truth is the sound quality doesn't matter if it's a hassle to enjoy it. These require very close proximity to the paired device, you wouldn't be able to stay connected if you're not in direct line of sight I've found and that's no bueno.
Noise cancellation 4/5
Noise cancellation works pretty well here, no complaint on that part. I even love the hearr through function of the headphones that amplify your surroundings sounds for better hearing. It doesn't always do well with voice amplification however and sometimes goes into and idle mode where there's no hear through at all, just dead muffles from a plugged ear until the phone rings or you get a message, etc.

Overall 3.5/5
Sadly I'd overall give these headphones a 3.5. I found them affordable enough for what I wanted them for. However they haven't delivered fully on that dream of being truly wireless. Given the poor performance of the connection even in pocket, muchless when I'm in separate rooms and some other things.
I look forward to the next iteration of these headphones as I'd love to try one with a few updates that address the issues I have. Great sets but they just aren't as perfect as they could have been.
Cheers everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality was pretty good, and the battery life was great. The left earbud just stopped working after 2 months of use. At first, it would crackle as if it was trying to connect to the right earbud. After a week of that, it just stopped working completely. I am back to using my old Epic 2 earbuds. I realized the sound quality is better than the Elite 65t.

They look cool, they fit great. The problem is the audio lacks any depth. There is absolutely no bass. As someone who rarely cares about bass, I didn't think it would be a problem. After a few weeks of use, I am returning them. I found myself going back to my standard plug-in earbuds just so I could listen to my music again.

Also, when I would take out my left earbud and move it farther than 2 feet away from the right earbud, all audio would stop. It was extremely annoying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_336?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=336&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, the more time I spend with them, I’m actually finding them preferable in a number of ways with a few caveats.

They connect just as well as the AirPods did with my iPhone XS Max. Sound quality is noticeably better and richer. Noise isolation is much improved.

At first, these were a little painful to wear for more than 15 minutes but comply tips helped some, and now I’ve gotten used to them and they don’t bother me as much if any.

I especially like the mode that can enhance background sounds to allow for listening to surroundings while listening to music and it can be turned on and off in app for more isolation.

I regularly do 10K runs and haven’t had any issues with sweat. Only other complaint is that because of their tighter sealed off fit, I tend to hear every foot strike through my skull while wearing them. At first, it was pretty annoying but I have gotten used to it. As my cadence is around 165 spm, that would be 165 thuds I would hear every minute, so the first few times I kinda had a headache but now it doesn’t bother me as much. AirPods never had this issue, but probably because the fit in my ears wasn’t as sealed off.

Case is a little larger than AirPods, but not much. I honestly like it better. The reason my AirPods crapped out is because the way the charging slots are down in little tubes in the case which would get kinda nasty and was difficult to keep debris free and clean, leading to inconsistent charging. About a year in with those, I’d often find myself getting to the trail only to find one bud was dead while the other was fully charged so it was anyone’s guess whether they would work or not, even after running a delicate pipe cleaner in to swap the contacts the night before. The Jabras have a much better charging setup, imho. The contacts are easy to wipe clean as needed. The buds themselves also seem easier to keep clean and tips can be replaced if they get kinda crushed up, which let’s be honest–if you’re working out in them (which is 90% my use-case for wireless ear buds), it’s gonna happen. Only plus to the AirPods case design was the slightly smaller size and the magnetic lock-in of the buds inside the case when open.

Battery life isn’t as great as the AirPods, but still more than adequate for my use. I just charge the case once or twice a week.

Audio stays connected pretty well. I have noticed on rare occasion brief audio cutout, but it’s so rare that it doesn’t bug me.

Jabras work well for calls. However, only the right bud supports single-bud use. Remove it and the left bud doesn’t work. Not a deal breaker for me.

I don’t know if I had paid full price at $170 for them, but on sale these are a great buy and the 2 year warranty is a plus. Compared to the AirPods, they are less conspicuous (which I like) with better sound. They connect well to newer devices as they incorporate newer Bluetooth tech. There are a few caveats, but most of them I have now gotten used to while others are not significant enough to warrant returning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Both sounded very good, but could not abide the cutting in and out. Bought some Nuheara IGBuds and liked them fine, a bit expensive but I did manage a 30% discount. Only problem is they have to be on the left side for consistent connectivity. Just for kicks, I tried the Jabra Elite 65t from Amazon Warehouse and wow, these phones are especially impressive at $118 (plus tax). I know they are $149 new, but decided to save a bit. So glad I tried them. SQ is a bit better than the IQBuds, which have more functionality from a tricked out perspective. But for the price difference, no contest. The Jabras are keepers while the IQBuds are going to spend more time in a drawer. I do use the IQBuds now and then too, but Jabra is just an overall better sound to my aging ears. They also are a bit smaller, though both have excellent comfort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_316?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=316&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm afraid if anything breaks it will be the lid to the case, and the headphones won't change probably unless the case is latched keeping them pressed on the pogo pins.

When an ear bud is taken out, the media you are listening to will pause, and resume playing when the earbud is put back in.

I read the reviews, did my research and was excited to try these.

I'm not a audiophile, but they do sound fantastic. The Sound+ app allows a lot of extra configuration and allows for software updates.

The standard ear pieces fit snug and does a pretty good job with sound isolation. The battery life runs for a solid 5 hours which is more than enough in my case.

However, the biggest issue I am having is audio balance. The left bud is waaay louder than the right bud, and adjusting the balance on the phone settings decreases overall volume to almost nothing. When using a single bud, like I do at work, it takes a good 20 minutes of quiet audio and then the balance fixes itself until the next time you connect them.

I am not sure if it's a hardware or software issue, but it's a huge downfall for such a great pair of true wireless buds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the gold (more like khaki) to be less obvious, but they're still pretty obvious. I don't even care. It's wonderful to just touch a button on my ear and answer calls hands-free. The sound is fantastic, and no one yet has complained about not hearing me well. Thanks to these babies, I despise holding a handset to my ear nowadays.

In the car, at work, and at home, I talk on my Jabra ear buds always. If the phone isn't ringing much and I'm not listening to music much, the battery holds all day long. With constant audio use, I get the full five hours before putting them back in the case to charge for a little while. Bass could be a bit stronger, but overall they are wonderful.

My workplace no longer has cubicles, so these earbuds are lifesavers when coworkers get loud. I turn on calming music and tune them out. I love how seemlessly the audio on my cell phone switches to these when I put them on. Most of the time I have them on anyway though. I love to cook, and it's great to have these as opposed to trying to hold a phone between ear and shoulder. Also, I don't always want to talk on the phone, but sometimes feel obligated, depending on who's calling or why. With these in my ears, I have much more patience than when I have to hold a phone against my head.

The Jabra app is great. I enjoy the ""cave"" ambient sound, the quick visibility of battery status, and easy access to instructions for use. These have great audio, they're super easy to use, and no one on the other end of a call seems to notice that I'm not holding a phone against my head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_308?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=308&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My phone is a Google Pixel 2XL and have been using Pixel Buds wireless headset for the past 18 months. The sound quality of the Pixel Buds was great for me, but people always had trouble hearing me and I would unintentionally, regularly drop calls due to the Buds terrible controls. I chose the Jabra Elite 65t for the great reviews and reasonable price. I have been using Jabra for the past 3 weeks and my impressions so far are:

Pros:
- Call quality - great. My call partners don't complain about sound quality or wind noise and I can hear them clearly.
- Charging Case - small and sleek.
- Comfort and Fit - excellent. The Jabra fit very well in my ears and I never have to worry about them falling out. A massive improvement over my Pixel Buds.
- Assistant Support - excellent support for Google Assistant. The Jabra also support Siri and Alexa, but I did not try those, as my primary assistant is Google.
- Controls - the Jabra are easy to pair and react quickly. Volume is simple to adjust using the left ear piece, however, I find that I have to really push on the piece to activate the function, which pushes the ear bud uncomfortably into my ear.

Cons:
- Music / Podcast quality - very mediocre. Music and podcasts sound puny. Bass is weak. I tried adjusting using the Jabra equilizer app, but the change was not noticeable. The Jabra are not even in the same league in this category as the Pixel Buds I was using previously

Bottom line - I like the Jabra a lot for their phone call function, ease of use and excellent comfort and fit; however, they are poor for music and podcasts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Therefore, I tried to get help form Jabra support and email them the problem I face, they told me to reset it. I follow all of their instructions but it still won't work. So I asked for a return and I told them it's also okay that if I can trade a new one, then they never ever reply to my emails again!!!!!

I was looking for a solution that would work well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 phone, which supports 400 gig micro sd cards.

Though I've given the 65t 5-stars across the board, that is compared to other wireless earbuds.  I'm very pleased with the sound quality though, again, that is compared to other earbuds.  They don't equal a good pair of over-the-ear headphones.  However, sound quality is surprisingly good, and certainly good enough for what I want them for.  The sound field is relatively wide and, with a little EQ applied, I can hit my sweet spot for bass and treble response.  Mid-range is clean and bass isn't too muddy.

They're reasonably comfortable -- at least as far as earbuds go.  For longer flights (more than 2 hours), though, I'll probably rely on my Bose QC-25s.  The 65ts are not active noise-cancelling, but the fit is comfortable and secure and should block most exterior noise.  The ""hear through"" feature is welcome because it means not having to take them out of my ears when the FA comes around for drink orders. :)

Jabra has a nice app for Android and iPhone -- I use the Android version.  The control it provides is pretty basic but it does include 5-band EQ and lets you control ""hear through"" and other features.  It also handles firmware updates to the 65t.  I've tried pairing it with my non-Bluetooth Fiio X5ii HD player through a Taotronics 8A08 Bluetooth transmitter and it works very, very well.  The Taotronics is about the size of a matchbook, so if I don't feel like using my phone (which has decent, but not audiophile quality, audio) I can use my Fiio.  Both the 65t and the Taotronics support AAC, which means better quality audio and lower latency -- the latter is important if you want to watch videos.

I'm pleased with the 65t and recommend it if you're looking for good-quality wireless earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was looking forward to the true wireless on my runs and minimizing my accessories. Out of the box, I was impressed with the look and feel in the ear with a snug fit and good sound. While I think a magnetic close on the case is preferable, the case was compact and feels nice to the touch.

The initial connection seemed like more of a struggle than it should have been but once connected to my Pixel phone, the music came to life and I was pleased. Next, I connected to my Garmin watch (with music / worn on left wrist). Again, the initial connection was tedious, but again, once connected, the sound was really nice. Then the problems developed...

Go on my first run, connect to my watch, music playing.... then I leave the house in a very typical residential neighborhood. I get about 10 - 20 feet from my house and the music starts to persistently drop out. I never lose connection, but during the entire 4 mile run, persistent drop out - both ears. I go for a second run and wait to connect until I get to the street, but that did not help. On the third run, I use my phone (back zipper pocket), but again that did not help with the dropout; it was unchanged.

I call Jabra; they think it might be the master earbud (since it is in both ears) and send a replacement. That was no help. I switch back to my JBX2s and still have no issue with either my watch or cell. I call Jabra back. At this point, the CSR says well, it is obviously environmental. Environmental? She held the position that during an entire 4 mile run (out and back) and an entire 5 mile run (loop), that this environmental interference was so pervasive that it continuously caused dropout. Not even 5 seconds of continuous, uninterrupted, music. She maintained this position despite my JBs, in the same environment, performing flawlessly.

I take the Jabra to another location, about 5 miles from my home, and encounter the exact same issue. But in trying to diagnose this issue, (I wear my watch on my left wrist and the master earbud is in my right ear), I noticed that if I held my hand near my heart that the drop out would stop. So, on my next run, I wear my watch on the right and the problem is resolved. But that means that the music device must be within a meter (and no interference) to work. Unacceptable.

I am not sure why it works better inside (maybe the Bluetooth signal is stronger bouncing off walls). But these are advertised as ""Active"" and for them to suffer the dropout that they do, when it is represented up to 10 meters, is simply unacceptable. At a minimum, they should sell a left that is a as master. I mean, I might be dense, but the music should play consistently without dropout rather than dropout consistently.

When all this was presented to Jabra, the response was flippant, along the lines of, ""Oh well, it must be environmental...not our problem, good luck,"" without regard for the same environment not causing in issue in other earbuds. This is clearly a problem with the Bluetooth range of these ear pods. I hope there is a software fix for this. If not, the device is defectively designed. That would be a shame because these have real potential.

Simplicity: They are very intuitive and simple to use once you get the hang of it. Take the left one out and they stop, put it back in and they start playing. Tap right side once to stop or play. Tap right side twice to allow outside noise in or out.
Battery: Have not had any battery issues while using for several hours. If you're always putting them back in the case they'll always stay charged.
Comfort: They're going to feel a little bit different compared to other earbuds your used to. With that being said, after using a couple weeks they start to feel more normal. These also don't irritate my ears and are much more comfortable than even less invasive headphones that simply sit in the ear.
Quality: The sound quality is great! I notice instruments that i normally dont get to hear when listening to speakers. The bass isn't crazy or anything. But I'd say for a small pair of bluetooth headphones, the quality is as good as you're going to get for the size. As technology continues to develop I'm sure you'll be able to get higher quality drivers in a small shell but for now I think they sound great. If your going purely for sound, I wouldnt do earbuds or wireless, I'd go over-ear.
Dislikes:
My only dislike is that sometimes the left ear can sound a bit staticy. The only reason why I didn't take a star off is because I've figured out how to resolve the isssue. I simply pause the music for two seconds and try it again. Usually the reconnection fixes the problem instantly. All it takes is hitting the pause button and then resuming. It doesn't happen all the time only every once in a while and I've heard of this happening with just about every brand of wireless bluetooth earbuds.

Overall, I love these earbuds. They look good, feel good, sound good and perform good. They're also not too bulky they don't come out further than the silhouette of your ear, meaning you wouldn't be able to see them coming out wider than your ear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- They look good and don't stick out of your ear really far like the Bose ones. I tried on the Bose ones and they looked
  ridiculous because they stick out so far.
- Truly wireless
- Good sound. The ""hear-through"" seems to work well.
- Google assistant seems to work pretty well with them

Cons
- Physical buttons - In order to change the volume/skip song, you have to push physical buttons on the earpiece, which
  means it gets pushed into your ear canal and is really uncomfortable. I think it would be way better if the buttons
  were not physical but just a touch or tap to change it.
- Speaking of buttons, I HATE when headphones or speakers make you hold down the + or - buttons to go to next
  song or previous song. It needs to be the double tap or triple tap on the main play/pause button. Thats how my old
  Beats were and it was nice.
- Can fall out of your ear fairly easily. I changed to the smallest rubber insert which helped a little bit but they still fall
  out sometimes if i am moving around a lot (jump rope, burpies, etc.). Maybe its just the shape of my ear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Where this goes wrong is after 6 moths of light use, I started having issues with the right earpiece. The audio level would drop and get distorted. I called Jabra Support and was on hold for over 45 min until I got dropped. I called back and finally another 52 min later I  spoke to a CSR. I was told I would receive an email with a link to fill out the request for a replacement and to submit my proof of purchase. I filled out the form and uploaded the receipt. When you click on the submit button nothing happens, No confirmation etc. I tried this with two different browsers to make sure this wasn't the issue and I had he same results. Two weeks later, I get an email stating that my info has been received and I would get another email when the replacement part ships. Fast forward 5 weeks I receive an email with a totally different name in the heading than mine and stating that they haven't shipped the item and it is estimated to be another month till it ships.

I wanted to be able to wear them for up to 8 hours at a time, as they are quite small and easily lost if I kept handling them, even if used in their charging / carrying case.

When I first started to use them, I found them to be very easy to connect to my phone's bluetooth and even fit into my ear.  The dual use (Main earbud and secondary earbud) really improved the sound quality and exterior noise blocking, but there are a few times that there is a static or brief interruption of the connection.  I really only use the main earbud, again for driving purposes, so that issue isn't a big one for me.

What I did find to be annoying, which led to the reduction of stars to ""It's ok"", is that everyone's ear canals are different, so what works well for one person won't work well for another.  That's the case with me...  These are quite comfortable for an hour or so at a time, but if you are looking to use them in a manner such as I am, then the ear really stars to get sore after that amount of time.  Unlike corded earbuds, these aren't just small circles placed into the ear, these are the entire ear piece with all the electronics placed within the ear.  Any kind of sweat and activity will eventually loosen the original tight fit and require a readjustment.  I did use two of the three size adjustment pieces (small / medium) to see if that helped and it did, but not enough to change my overall rating of this product.

If you are ok with the above information and you have an ear canal that works well with these, then I would rate them a 4+ star, but as it depends on the person, I couldn't really go below a 3 star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wish the tips were better.","After reading a few negative reviews, I was most concerned about (1) Bluetooth connection reliability, and (2) audio lag when watching videos. Personally, I haven't experienced either of those issues when using either my Android phone or my MacBook.

The biggest issue I've had is an annoying amount of static coming from the left earbud. It seems to start up when I turn the volume up past about 75%, either from the button on the left earbud, or from my laptop/phone. It seems to be interference related, because the static is worse at my office and in some parts of my house. I did some googling and found a few other people complaining about the same problem. None of the fixes I found online worked for me.

The second biggest issue I've had is that the stock earbud tips are really uncomfortable and don't seal well (I have narrow ear canals). The stock tips also don't have a wax guard over the sound hole, which seems like an oversight.

In the end, I bought the Comply tips designed for these earbuds. They're great and it turns out that they help immensely with the static issue because the better seal lets me use the earbuds at a lower volume where the static isn't a problem.

Overall these earbuds are great. Sound quality is awesome, the form factor is fantastic, and I haven't run the batteries down all the way yet in a few months of daily use recharging at night. I would have given them five stars if only they came with some better tips.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even though they appear to be smaller than the stock medium tips that come with the earbuds, they have a tighter fit, that is more secure especially during a workout.

The only problem I have is the very rarely when using them to watch videos on my laptop they will stop for half a second, then resume as normal. This only happens on my laptop, the connection with my phone is great. It's also very helpful that they can connect to multiple devices at the same time, it makes using them quick and easy.
 The battery is as expected, I've never used finished both the earbud and case charge in one day. The case is more compact than i had thought and is easy to use.
Mic quality is quite good and the hear-through feature is extremely helpful. the buttons on the side, something that many truly wireless earphones don't have, are easy to use and very helpful. Overall these earbuds are very compact and efficient, and i'm very happy with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And like most of the people here, my issue is with the left earbud. I don't like dealing with constant static and the sound dropping out every 5-10 seconds. The main reason I bought these is because I work in a restaurant, and at night the kitchen tends to get rather loud. The noise cancellation feature is one of the best aspects of these earbuds. The sound quality is gorgeous. I'm a musical type of person so being able to hear each and every different type of pitch and tone is a massive plus for me. When I first got them on Monday, they worked absolutely perfect. No dropped sound, perfect call quality and stupid easy Bluetooth setup and connection. Still, the left earbud, AFTER 3 DAYS, is now half audio/half static. With the sound cutting out every few seconds. I have a pair of old LG tone infinim earphones that I have duct taped in two different places and the work better than these earbuds. For this price, the amount of static should be non-existent.

It's  sad because i likeded these , but i wont pay 170.00 for inferior product and i dont like apple.

1st review

1) this is an excellent product , expecially for the battery life and sound quality and reception is good also (pros )

2) this product sometimes , but rarely glithches in signal , also they are kinda light weight for price could be made of more sturdy material , for the price.

Overall excellent sound quality and the battery life , continuous play at full volume about 6 hours and at 50 % volume about 7 to 7 1/2  use one ear piece for work and when i listen to music and watch movies i use 2 ear pieces i watch 1) 2hour movie , listen to music and take phnes calls , and this head set last me easily 10 hours no problem . And thats without having to continuously charge and that is not including charging case life

* for those negative reviews their is always defective units in electronics,  but give these a chance and uf you receive a bad pair request another , they are worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been using them for a month now and I have no complaints at all. The sound is amazing. To the point when listening to music there are some things in some songs I have never even heard before. The noise cancellation is great but also gives an option to have sound pass through. It's great options for when you want to sit and really listen to music but also let's you pass sound through so you can hear around you when driving or whatever. They are very comfortable for me. Now I do have larger ears. I've had a couple people with small ears say they are a little to big for their ears but for me they are fantastic. The microphone is top notch. Everyone says I sound so much better with them. To the point a couple people have asked if I got a new phone because I sound so much better with them. The case is great as well. Because of the cases doubling as a rechargeable battery I can go days without having to recharge them. Infact I think it's been 6 days since I had to recharge the whole unit. I have nothing but praise for them.

However, 3 major considerations that you most likely didn't hear well from the other reviews.
1. Voice Assistants. Just updated the firmware (May 22. 2018) on my 65t's. Still no Alexa implementation. ""Coming soon"". Well, that sucks. Siri works fine (if you like Siri but I don't). Reading the ads and the reviews, I thought Alexa would have been ready by now. It isn't. Of course, the AirPods only respond to Siri, which really is (and always has been) sad. Kudos to Jabra for at least having Alexa in the works. I'll judge the earbuds when Alexa makes it to the Jabras.
2. Fit. The Jabra's aren't as easily inserted as the AirPods. They are fairly glossy and not as easily gripped. The choice of the rubber inserts is VERY important. Let's say that the fit is critical, which is true for all earbuds. The AirPods are much easier to seat. However, you either like the one-size fits all AirPods or you don't. Fortunately maybe, the AirPods fit me very well. The charging case on the Jabra is noticeably larger, which makes slipping them in a front pocket a bit more difficult. At least being larger, the Jabra's won't be as easily washed in the washer as the AirPods (twice now, they survived luckily). I still like the AirPods better. Sorry, Jabra.
3. Sound. As much as I wanted to like the Jabra's, they just didn't have the bass or the width of the sound field like the AirPods. Even with the Jabra iPhone app, they still didn't rock real bass. I don't usually like separate apps for earbuds (like Sony, Bose, etc). Just another step to getting the best sound. Surprisingly, the AirPods have significantly deeper bass and a much wider sound presence. Yes, I tried all the different rubber inserts and the equalizer for the Jabra's. Still not what I have expected from other reviews.

So, the Jabra's were very disappointing and are going back. The AirPods are still in my pocket. Try the AirPods, the bass and sound quality are the best of the wireless earbud bunch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_363?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=363&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s a software fault because now being an owner of three faulty pairs (they never wanted them back) I have experimented with swapping left buds, which fixed the problem, for about an hour, even when switch left bude back to their original right bud, so not a hardware thing.

The sound quality is OK for music, but when I'm on a call, it sounds like I'm speaking to someone through a tin can even when I change the settings to voice mode through the app. I also have so much trouble switching connectivity from one device to the next. I wanted to use the earbuds with my iMac, iPad, and iPhone, but switching is far from seamless. I often have to select ""forget this device"" and reconfigure it any time I want to connect do a different device. So for example, if I'm using my earbuds on my iPad to watch a movie and then I get a call on my iPhone, I can't just disconnect from one device and turn on the bluetooth to the other device. I've almost missed calls because I was trying to switch. I thought Bluetooth headphones were supposed to be convenient? Also, I got the gold ones and they look like giant hearing aids.

I contacted support and tried their methods to correct this (standard routine of re-pairing, reinstalling the firmware, ...) and it made no difference.  I returned my initial pair and got another thinking it was a defect but the 2nd pair behaves exactly the same.

Even though I'm in the Android ecosystem, I tried pairing some AirPods to the same device and they worked without issues.  The device was left upstairs and I was able to go downstairs to the other side of the house before they cut out.

I was super excited to receive them and immediately paired with my phone (easy!) and registered them (easy!).  I quickly tried them on and couldn't get a seal in the right ear.  No problem, I figured I'd try them out on my commute the following day.  I brought along the extra sets of ear gels in case I had the same issue.  Sound quality was great, but I could not get the right earbud to stay in, no matter which gel I used or how much I jiggled and maneuvered it. Just when I thought I had it in, it would plop out onto my lap.  The left one stayed in using the medium gel, no problem, though I think it would become painful after a while.  I didn't find it very comfortable, but bearable.  Maybe I have a deformed right ear canal or something, but nothing seemed to work on that side.  I was on my train for over two hours messing around with these things, but could not get them to stay put (and that was me sitting; I would have lost it in 2.5 seconds if I had been anything other than stationary).  So, as much as I want to keep these, I'm returning them :(  I'd say if you don't have trouble with regular earbuds, you're probably OK - I've always been hit or miss with earbud fit, but was hoping these would be The Ones.

The audio 65t audio is better but comparable, but the noise canceling is where it shines, of course.

Build: I actually prefer the metal build of the Mifo buds and case, but the fit on the 65t is perfect (at least for my ears).

Battery: the 65t is fine. The noise canceling uses more battery life, so it doesn't last as long as the mifo,but more than that the mifo case has a beefier battery, meaning longer between case charging... But the 65t case is lighter.

All in all, I definitely prefer the 65t, but I was surprised at how well the mifo stacked up.

One caution: do not get the gold/beige: the overall impression it convey is not ""futuristic luxury"" but ""medical device.""

This headset fared worse than the other two options at how loud the background tv show was and how well you could hear the message I left.

Just OK for music. 3.75 stars overall.","Phone calls are great and crystal clear for both parties. Does a good job of filtering out normal background noise. Don’t expect to be in a loud environment and other person not hear. They aren’t that good, but good enough for everyday calls. I use these for conference calls on my cell and skype calls from my Laptop through Bluetooth and they work great.

They are comfortable and will not fall out. The app is great and very useful. You can use only 1 bud but it has to be the right one. Left will not work by itself.

I am not quite an audiophile but I am more experienced and critical than most. I am picky about how I want my music to sound. Sound quality on these buds is just ok for me. These sound like a pair of $40-50 wired ear buds. My biggest complaint with these is the bass and volume level. At max volume these are about 70% the volume of my $50 Sony wired buds. No distortion though. Bass is lacking but present. Those really deep notes are weak even with the eq set to bass boost.  The overall sound quality is no where as polished as the Bose sound sports for about the same price.

As for games and videos, yes there is a delay as most Bluetooth headphones have. What’s weird is that the delay varies. In the Xfinity stream app and also Netflix there is little to no noticeable lag at all, which is great. Browser videos, YouTube, and Facebook videos are hit or miss. Some videos have a huge lag while some are only a slight delay. Games have a huge lag as well which make these basically unusable for that purpose.

If you have 170 bucks to spend and phone calls is your #1 priority, these are for you. If bass and sound quality is what you want Bose is MUCH better. As a traveling salesman I’m happy with my purchase since calls is a major reason I selected these. I will be keeping my wired buds in my travel bag for music and movies on the plane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you have a problem, be prepared to wait.","For the price of these headphones, you would hope for a quality product.  If there is a problem with the product, you would expect the company to try their best to make you happy.

I bought these headphones in October of 2018.  I'm writing this review in April of 2019.  The left earbud is dead.  Jabra is willing to replace the earbuds but you must ship them back and wait for them to send you another set.  I asked support how long that takes and their response is 3 weeks...

I cannot believe that Jabra will not cross ship or do anything to speed up this process.

These headphones are not abused.  I wear them every day during my commute for about 20 minutes each way.  I wear them while walking.  The left earbud sound quality degraded to the point that I can no longer use them.

I contacted support and they sent me an email detailing how to reset them to factory, then update the firmware, then rebind.  Same issue.  Contacted support again today hoping they will send  me a replacement set.  They will but it is a huge turn around time.  I now have to go buy another set of earbuds to use while waiting to get these back.

Buyer beware - for a $170 set of headphones, you would think they would last more than 6 months without breaking.
 To add to that, you must wait around 3 weeks to get them replaced.  This is not good customer service for what is supposed to be a quality product.

I have had other bluetooth headphones that have lasted much longer.  I definitely will not buy another Jabra product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main one is the ambient noise feature. Although it is passive noise cancelling, the ambient noise features lets you hear your surroundings, so when your riding your bike you can still hear your surroundings and when you get to your destination you can easily turn it off.
The sound quality also is pretty good. Better than regular apple headphones, but no Bose.
The app has low reviews but I found it to be helpful. You can play background noise (ie river flowing or white noise) and change the bass and treble levels. However, I wish there was a better find my headphones feature. The headphones are not magnetically secure in the case, so they could fall out if you're not careful. Samsung and apple headphones have a feature that plays sounds from the headphones when you lose them so they can be easily found. I wish the Jabras had that instead of a general last location.
There are some small issues with the headphones that made me return them. It is not comfortable. My left ear was aching/turning numb from 2+ hours use. I have heard these are very comfortable but for my friend and I they hurt at least one of our ears. Also there is a static feedback in the headphones when you don't listen to music and when you start playing music.. The Airpods (no matter what anyone says about them) don't have a static noise when you are not listening to music and just have the headphones in.
Overall, I'm not sure if they are worth it. Even if they fit your ears comfortably and you don't mind the static noise, for the price there are other competitors. Samsung buds are almost half the price and have the same features (even has a better find my headphone feature). Although the Jabra has a better sound quality, it is not that noticeable and you shouldn't be looking at bluetooth headphones if sound quality is your main issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They came 60% charged. Downloaded the app, updated the firmware.  Done in a few mins. These are definitely not the best sounding headphones. BUT, THEY FIT PERFECT right out the box! And they sound decent. Maybe once the drivers bed in they’ll sound better. If the wind changes direction my left AirPod falls out. It never seals right so it sounds terrible. Zero problem with these so far. The noise canceling with sound pass through is a great feature and it works well. I can’t speak on the battery life yet. But initial overall reaction is 100% positive. I’m coming from Cambridge’s fully wireless earbuds and they are absolute garbage.

I also wanted wireless earbuds that did not have a wire that hangs around the neck. In the market today, there are average wireless ""wired"" earbuds (like the jaybird) and they all price around the same 70-90 value. I had previously owned jaybirds and they were great until I lost them. As mentioned, I was willing to pay a lot more for quality earbuds and ones that were completely wireless. Then I searched and heard about these Jabras. I was VERY skeptical at first because of the price. I mean I know for sure sound quality will be 200%, but will these last, will they fit in my ear without hurting, and will they be good for a frequent gym goer like myself. The answer to all those questions is yes.

In detail, the sound quality is amazing and I get a great suction and noise cancellation when using these. When I first popped in the earbuds, they hurt a little due to the size in both my ears. I kind of ignored it, but it became noticeable throughout the workout so I started reading up on people's opinions on the fit. It was a hit or miss; however, I found out that you can slightly rotate the earbuds up and down (once it's in your ear) and BAM, pain was gone, and fit was perfect. I assume the battery life is amazing, but I always pop my buds in my charger which is connected in my car. As for sweat resistance, I think these are doing good so far. Unless my doing an ultra long/tough workout, the sweat usually doesn't hit my ears/the buds and I always use towels so my buds stay dry for the most part. The buds stay in my ear perfectly for most of the workout, it's when I start doing HIIT exercises or running on the treadmill is when they start sliding out. I honestly believe this is expected of ALL earphones. The nature pressure on your head and ears during movements is gonna pop them out on their own. Distance is good for about 50 feet from wherever your buds are connected too, but beyond that you will start hearing stuttering and disconnecting sounds or whatever.

Just a few minor dislikes to note, but it is nothing game changer. Be careful where you put these because you can easily lose them. Also, I recommend taking them off when you are changing a shirt or sweater. I have had these pop out my of my ear doing so and had almost lost them. The other dislike is the case. Buds fit perfectly, looks sturdy, small to carry anywhere; however, I dislike how you open the case. It has a nice click/shut to it which is nice because it'll keep your buds secure and charging, but I have to press pretty hard on the case every time to open it I feel like I might crack the case at one point.

Overall, if you what high quality earbuds, earbuds that completely wireless, and a frequent gym goer, I HIGHLY recommend these. They pack a price punch but you definitely get what you pay for and it's worth it.

I am not an audiophile, but the sound quality is good for me. I listened to music, podcasts, and books as well as make conference calls.

The sidetone is weak making the headset generally unsuitable for long phone calls. The mics also pick up a lot of background noise, again, making them only good for an emergency backup for a better VoIP setup. This is disappointing. They also don't pair all that easily with laptops and do not automatically reconnect so, again, these are a poor option for VoIP.

The main reason I give a rating of only three is that, depending on your ears, the headset will not stay firmly seated enough and easily slips out. My right ear is OK. My left ear does not fit well and the earbud falls out. This is extremely frustrating on flights because the earbud is extremely difficult to find. I had a long trip and it fell out twice and I got lucky both times finding it. I had to use the flashlight on my phone and woke people up while I searched. Not good. These are too expensive to risk losing them like that. Plus, if you don't have a backup, then you are stuck with no sound for a 12 hours flight.

There is no tether or ear flap or hook option for these headsets. So, if the provided inserts do not fit well for you, then you are left only using these in environments where you are able to regularly reseat the earbuds and you can reasonably easily find them when they fall out. If you sleep on a flight, you can expect these to fall out.

If you want something you can trust to stay in, then you should probably look elsewhere. The sport option might work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For this price I would expect top of the line quality. So far all I have experienced are problems.

Pros:
- Look good
- Feel good
- Charging Case looks & Battery life

Cons:
- Bluetooth is terrible! Routinely disconnects / reconnects. Phone calls have a static and/or distorted noise while also constantly cutting in and out. This is with my phone literally inches away from me.
- Pressing buttons is a pain. You either jam the earpiece into your ear drum or you have to weirdly hold the earpiece in place while you push the button.
- Without looking at the app there is no good way to determine battery level or even if the devices are on/off
- Placing the earpieces in the charging case is easily done wrong and no way to tell if they aren't aligned correctly in the case which means they aren't charging.
- No way to tell how charged the device is
- The list goes on - just a number of little things that you'd expect to be figured out when you pay this kind of money for headphones. The terrible Bluetooth is the most frustrating as I've never had any problems with connection when using any other headphones (which have all been mostly under $35).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In fact, before they had even arrived, I had told my husband that he could have them… He routinely loses headphones though (seriously, I think that he has lost at least five pairs of the headphones that the iPhones come with), and when they arrived they looked so small being all wireless and with a case looked miniscule in his big hand. So, I thought, well, I will just try them out first… and then he can have them.

But I never gave them over!! Instead, I fell in love with them. The headphones really retain their charge, which I love, and there is a little battery icon that shows up on your phone so that you can easily see their level. And the carrying case recharges them, and has a light on the bottom to indicate its level of charge. And it doesn’t take it long to recharge fully, either. I stop and start use them a lot at work, and then use them for longer stretches walking our dog or cleaning in our house and only one time have I actually run out of power! They are comfortable, too – and definitely noise-cancelling! Plus, I love the voice of the lady who assures me that they are in fact connected to my phone, and prompts you to respond if a call comes through while wearing them. They work great as a headset for your phone, too! They have a wider range from the phone as well than I expected, as I discovered while cleaning. I had managed to get quite far away from my phone before discovering that the problem was that I had left my phone on a dresser as I set off to put clothes away in another bedroom!

Because they are inner ear headphones, they are also easy to clean and are super portable – where I once listened to audiobooks only in the car, at home or walking the dog, now I find myself using these headphones as I shop, work and run other miscellaneous errands. I love them and would be heartbroken if my husband were to use them and lose one! So these are mine… all mine!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far, they have been great. I use them every day on my commute to work, at the gym, and sitting outside on my lunch break. They sound great, and volume control and track forward buttons work easily enough after a short learning curve. I love the hear-through function. It's especially good when trying to hear announcements on the subway, and keeps you safe on the street. I don't find it as useful when trying to have a conversation with someone. I frequently have to remove one to properly hear a person. When this function is off, it pretty much shuts out all the ambient sound. I was very impressed when I walked past a construction site and could hear my music without the background Jack hammers. The sync with BT works especially fast, although there were 2 occasions when it didn't reconnect. I popped them back in the case for a second and then they work perfectly again. The fit is great, and they stay in my ears when running and working out at the gym. I haven't used them yet on a phone call so can't comment on that. I do highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_315?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=315&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So, I'm not a stranger to what's possible with wireless earbuds in this price range.

And in saying this, for music, these are the worst earbuds I've ever heard. The sibilance is painful. Not ""ugh, these aren't as fancy as I'd like."" They're literally painful to listen to. That's really sad, because there's so much else to like about these.

For instance, Jabra has pretty much nailed Bluetooth headsets, and that carries over here. No, nobody's going to tell you they don't know you're using a headset, but you're not going to spend the entire call with someone going ""WHAT?"" every few seconds. (Well... at least not if that isn't normal for them to begin with.) Even in relatively noisy environments, call quality was better than acceptable.

The overall fit of these is awesome. Put them in your ears, give them a little twist, and they stay in place. Personally, I would have preferred foam eartips over silicone, but the fit and seal is great. And the way the materials feel conveys a premium nuance.

The buttons on either earbud are logical, and work well across multiple devices. The integrated voice prompt for pairing was a nice touch, too. I didn't notice any substantial delay with these (much unlike the Bose earbuds), and unlike the Here Now and Samsung IconX, I never had a problem with one of the two earbuds falling out of sync or dropping out.

The included charging case is... well, it's a mixed bag. The earbuds fit nicely in the case, no matter what size tips you're using, and it charges reasonably fast. On the other hand, the retaining tab that keeps the lid shut is kind of a pain to use, and feels cheap. Battery life on the earbuds wasn't anything notable one way or the other.

If I wanted these exclusively for handling phone calls while doing something active (e.g. at the gym, on a bike trail) they're really good. Again, the call quality is very good, and they stay put. But for listening to music, you don't want these. If this is within your budget and you mostly care about music and maybe the occasional phone call, you probably want to consider the Shure SE215's.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll walk into another room at the gym where I can still see my phone and I'll have to pause my headphones manually because it is constantly cutting the music if I'm not near my phone. I also do not find these sweat resistant. As I was stretching after my workout to cool down, my left earbud kept popping out regardless of how hard I twisted it into my ear.

I prefer the look over the Airpods. the default ear gels I thought were a 'good' fit because the units were snug in my ear. Sound was a bit 'tinny' and had very little bass. On a whim, I changed out for the largest ear gels in the set and the sound was significantly improved (even my 70's POP). the only problem is the larger ear gels make the ear buds an awkwardly tight fit in the recharging case.

I use them biking and have been rewarded with a significant amount of wind noise. Have not played with the 'hear-through' settings at all to see if there is a level to minimize that.

  Good for phone calls
  Stay in well for me.
  Long battery life.
  Descent customer service. Good but
  Not great.

Cons:  these are significant to me, but not
  Everybody

  You can only use the right earbud by
  Itself.  I had a cheap $50 pair that I
  Could use either one solo. When I’m
  Working around the house I like to
  Wear only one and switch between
  Ears for comfort and battery.

  Another problem is that you can’t
  share w/somebody.  The earbuds
  have to be an exact distance apart
  For them to work.  On road
  trips I like to share w/my wife so the
  Kids don’t have to listen to our
  podcasts.

All in all they are good but not great. Compared to my cheap pair the only advantage is battery & phone call quality.  If you don’t plan on using them for phone calls, save your money.  For me the phone calls outweighed the other issues. Hopefully they improve this with newer models. I did have to return my first pair due to the battery not holding a charge. When you call expect to be on hold for a long time. For me it averaged 30 minutes.  Once I talked with somebody they were helpful, but it took way to long to get a replacement pair. After mine was returned it was 2 weeks and they didn’t even have the color I originally ordered so I had to take a color I didn’t want or wait another 2 weeks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So let’s start by the fit. Comes with different size tips and I did find the perfect fit for my ears. These things don’t move. No matter if it’s in the gym or laying down they fit great.
Now for the sound. I’m not an audiophile by any means. I just want something that sounds good and these do. I dod mess with the app that connects to these and make my own sound
Profile but there are set ones to choose from also. Bass is decent and the highs were also good. Overall sound is better then I expected.
Buttons are ok. You have to push on them in your ears so if your not careful it could become very uncomfortable if you push to hard.
The look in my ear is great. Most people don’t know they are in. I also use in the office and I will be on a call while people try to talk to me and I have to point to let them know I’m on the phone. Mic is great for calls. People on the other end say it sounds very good. Oh and here is one of my favorite features, I can just use the right one by itself which is another plus when in the office or car traveling.
Pass through hearing. You can turn this on in the app and still hear what’s going on around you while you listen to music or just have them in during the work day. Works decent. First time I’ve had a pair with this feature so can’t really compare.
The Charge. The earbuds have never died on me but I always put in the charging case which charges them Back up when I’m not using so I can’t confirm how long they really last. Charging case is ok. A little weird at first to open but then you get use to it. The earbuds sit in it nicely.

NOW here is my HUGE CON!!!!! So when I am at the gym the first pair I received would cut out in certain areas. Thought that’s weird and had them replaced. Well the second pair does the same thing around certain equipment. So I started googling and this is a common problem. As far as I can find something to do with the magnetic field of equipment but I’m not sure. I do know it always happens and in the same areas that I can’t avoid at the gym. So your listening to your favorite jam and boom it cuts out. Sometimes I have to power cycle to get to connect again. When I’m working out I don’t need this type of issue. If it wasn’t for that these things would be great. I wish I could return them now but I’m passed my time and will be purchasing the Powerbeats pro when they come out. It’s a bummer. I really wanted to like these but I guess I will try to sell them or just use as my office and car travel Bluetooth. People buying just beware of the gym fact, since these are active and people would probably be using these for that reason. I’m sure I forgot a couple things but I’m doing this review on my phone.

Daily usage in this price arena will do that.
1. Jabra was nice enough to explain that the left bud doesn't have bluetooth capability so there's no possibility of L/R working independently. Ty for that.
2. Jabra also told me to wait for their next firmware update to address the left channel favoring audio.
  a. After adjusting the balance to the right for an even soundstage, I couldn't take the lack of volume. Jabra, please fix this issue somehow. 3 firmware updates ago you addressed this but the actives are still having the issue. What gives?
3. The charge is incredible. Haven't done tech tests, but they last around 4 hours during my 8 hour shift.
4. No one addressed this but they can withstand HOT temperatures. It's almost July in AZ and no problems in 115°F+ (105°F ambient).
5. Sound Problems and Strengths: Absolutely no bass control. Cranking the Sound+ app to max renders blah. Bass just isn't there. When listening to rock I was expecting to be tickled with the bass drum hit but Jabra falls completely flat on the low end. So basically if you want some decent bass, these aren't a good choice.
6. Ergonomically being a first time user, they stay put under activity like getting in and out of vehicles. I use the smallest size and it would be nice to have more than 3 options of tips like a S/M or a M/S or whatever. Aftermarket tips are no better.
7. Case is bull****.
8. On call background noise - Okay so, my gf is a telecomm engineer and her company [used to] contract with Jabra. After reading reviews I was confident I'd have a restrictive on call experience. That's a negative. Jabra will tell you to reposition your buds so they utilize their half-assed non-existent isolation algorithm. These speakers are so sensitive that your caller can hear a bird sqwahking 100 feet away. It goes both ways however, in a quiet room or one without birds-awesome mics.
9. Sum it up - Great sound quality with lack of bass. Noise canceling and sound through is really good. ""HearThrough"" is finicky with limited apps I've used but not the majors, youtube included. Main bud click is comfy for pause, answer, click-and-hold voice control, but volume control sensitivity on the left bud is harsh! To open the case, squeeze the sides then pick the tab. Idk, the case is cool but it got dirty my first day of ownership. Jabra, upgrade us Active users with a magnetic case for free! It's ridic having our buds fly out when we're in a hurry. No regard for case accessibility at $189.  Thanks for reading.

Here are the hits and misses:

The good:
- They sound really good, and you can easily customize the sound profile in their app, which also functions well.
- They don't have noise cancellation, but the overall isolation quality is decent. The function that uses the microphones to bring in outside sounds is a nice feature too.
- Not a ton of bass (I mean, what do you really expect from headphones this size) but it's decent. Again, using the app's EQ really allowed me to tailor the sound to my liking.
- Fantastic battery life. I've never had to worry about these things running out of juice when I head to the gym and run errands.
- Jabra support (especially over Twitter) is pretty responsive and helpful.
- Comfortable. I have larger ears and have never found the headphones to be uncomfortable. They have a snug but not painful fit.

The bad:
- The headphones very loosely sit in the charging case when you put them in. It's way too easy for them to fall out when you open it, so do so carefully.
- The charging case itself has a smooth pebble-like shape, making it rather easy for it to slip out of large pockets.
- As others have said, the left headphone occasionally won't turn on when removed from the case. This is easily remedied by holding the down button on it, but it's still a bit annoying.
- The left headphone occasionally is susceptible to loud, very jarring interference that sounds like popping and cracking. It makes the headphones basically unusable when it happens, which thankfully is not that often.
- I'm replacing these headphones for the second time because the charging case isn't charging properly. It will sometimes show a full charge, then if I unplug and plug it back in, it shows a yellow or red light, indicating it's not fully charged.

The ugly:
- If your headphones need to be replaced, Jabra will NOT do advanced exchanges. In essence, in you're on the West Coast, be prepared to be without headphones for nearly two weeks while you wait for yours to reach Jabra and then for them to send you new ones. This, frankly, is unacceptable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_346?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=346&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lets cut to the chase.  These are probably the best ear-buds I have ever owned.  The sound quality is AWSOME!! The only complaint I have is that I must have weird shaped ears because I keep having one of them come loose and fall out.  Right Ear.  Hard to keep fit......Also, (and this may have to be due to my antique 4.0 Bluetooth Phone) pairing is not very efficient. These things will probably really work fine with 5.0. I lose paring at least once every hour (more if I traverse heavily populated areas/stores/malls with lots of electronic stuff.) I suppose I should return them, but the sound quality is so darn good and I don't think a smaller ear-bud exists.  One last gripe - though several extra earpieces are provided, it would have been nice if two of each size would have been included.  Also, if you have sensitive ears (as I do), the earbud (s) can get uncomfortable after about one hour.  Don't get me wrong, folks. These are amazing earbuds.....Just need a little ""tweaking""!!!

Spare a lot of money to buy it cause it's not cheap, and the first 1 week it was AMAZING, everything was perfect, the sound, the bass, the connection, the battery but nothing is perfect.

I've started to notice a few days ago that the LEFT earbud it's a LOT HIGHER in volume(balance) than the right one and this wasn't happening before, it suddently started to happens.

There is more than 60% of ppl who buys it with this problem in REDDIT, Jabra dont fix it, everyone is borred with this.

Im really hoping that they can give us a new firmware fixing it, or u will have waisted 200bucks in trash, literally.

The sound is actually really good, the battery life is very good. The carrying cases is the perfect size for me to put them in my pocket and carry around and can immediately listen to some of the videos that are sent to me on a moments notice.  I have two complaints though.  They really are not the most comfortable buds I have had.  I can only wear them for an hour or so, then have to give them a rest.  Overall however, this I can live with, and without any real problem.  The one thing that has turned these earbuds into an overall nightmare is that no matter what I do THEY KEEP TURNING ON BY THEMSELVES!!!!!  This is a real problem because during the day, I have important calls from work.  I will be talking to someone with the Bluetooth in my ear when all of a sudden, I no longer hear them.  When I look at my phone, I can see that it is connected to the Jabra earbuds (which are in my pocket).  I turn them off and I switch back to my Bluetooth earpiece.  Two minutes later, they have turned themselves back on (both buds) and have taken the call, playing the video, or whatever.  I have tried to find an answer for this to no avail.  There is no firmware to fix this, and no remedy.  This is completely unacceptable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_406?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=406&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound is incredible, hitting all the highs and lows flawlessly. The battery life is impressive considering how small the earbuds and case are.

I had purchased a product from Apple and returned it so I ended up getting the Apple Airpods and the experience actually changed my mind about truly wireless buds. I don't like the way the Airpods fit but like the freedom the truly wireless give. I looked around for something that would fit better and decided on the Jabra Elite 65t and I have to say I'm very happy I did. I own a number of what could be considered high end over the ear headphones as well as too many earbuds and I like to rotate between 4 pair. I mention this to give some perspective. I listen to a wide variety of music and just went for a 7 mile run on Monday Nov. 5 2018 using the 65t and I'm really impressed. I first thought the 65t's would not be comfortable but they really are to me. When I ran on Monday I used some thin headband ear warmers because it's getting cool here in Connecticut. Anyway the 65t's never felt lose or like they would fall out. I used them today when I went out to take care of business. When I run I listen to music from my Apple Watch Series 4 and the 65t's stayed connected and didn't miss a beat, even with the Airpods I had a couple of drop outs so it really appears the bluetooth is rock solid. I have not had any issues with the left and right buds not connecting when I first put them in, right then left of left then right. Also for me the music sounds pretty dog gone good too. I mentioned my over ear headphones (I list them in some other reviews) as a point of reference and to me these are really musical, i.e. let all the stuff I listen to come through, I don't miss a thing, not one thing. I am so happy I got these the freedom of truly wireless is awesome. The battery is not an issue either. Even when I happen to listen at home using these while cleaning the house or doing other chores I can't see the battery being an issue. Like this morning I had business to take care of and walked around for an hour or so and when I checked the battery level they were up around 90%. I'm happy so far and hope these hold up. Really glad I chose Jabra. It's going to be hard to go back to regular earbuds with the wire connection, I do bring a pair when I go on my runs or use the 65t's while out and about. I always bring an extra pair no matter what I'm using. Anyway my experience with the 65t's are really good.

Update 11/8/2018: Just a follow up. I really like these buds but kind of disappointed with Amazon customer service. I purchased these on 11/1/18 and now 11/8/18 they are $50 cheaper. I pay my way as Prime member and even if I wasn’t I think that if I purchased these from the Amazon store and then the next day they are discounted then why not give some consideration to people that paid full price within a week or so. Come on, you lose more money having me send them back for a refund then you have spend time and money having to get them ready to resell at and even lower price. I guess that’s somebody else is a billionaire and I’m complaining about $50.

12/12/18 Update: Sorry about the rant above. After further use of these and trying the Elite Sports as well as the AirPods, the regular Elite 65t are by far the best as far as I'm concerned. Even making and receiving calls on the Elite 65t's are perfect. I've been looking at other truly wireless pods and actually ordered a couple then canceled the order after thinking about how well these perform, so I went ahead and ordered another pair of Elite 65t's. One for working out and the other for casual use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted a pair of cordless headphones but as much as I’m an Apple fan, I couldn’t bring myself to purchase the AirPods because of the way they look (I know, I know). I’m so glad I got these Jabra 65t though and here’s why:

I am a 5’4 Asian female and I have relatively small ears. The fit of these (I used the med size caps) fit so snug, which I was surprised about because usually I have to use the super small ones. However, the minute I put these in they fit like a glove. The next test was the gym. Would they fall out when I started running or even when I was lifting weights? The answer is NO! They never felt loose when I was pounding away on the treadmill (relatively speaking...) and I felt confident that they were secure in my ears and were not going to fall out.

The sound quality works for me. I’m not super picky about sound quality, but I have to say the Jabras were great. I love the app as you can adjust the settings if you prefer more bass or more treble. I find it super handy. Also, outside noise. I didn’t hear a thing! (No annoying grunting from the dude next to me!).

If the tips fit your ears then this could be great, but if they don't it is absolutely horrible. I called Jabra and they cannot provide any other tips than the 3 stock gels that come with it. At this price point that is ridiculous as I've gotten 6 or move with in ear headphones that cost half of this set. For me all sizes were either small so didn't hold or block sound, or uncomfortable so I couldn't use them for more than 30 mins at a time. I've had countless in ear headphones so am well aware of how to get these to fit correctly and have never run into this issue before. The issue here is that with only 3 options there isn't anything to work with. Either they fit or they don't, and if they don't all the other great features of this device doesn't matter. The loose tips make the sound muddled and the volume low, and the uncomfortable ones help the sound quality but it gets distracting if you're using for more than 30 mins. Also, since they are wireless the ear tips keep these in place so even if you're OK with losing sound quality with a looser fitting tip, they will fall out with movement so that isn't an option.
My advice, if the return policy will let you send them back after trying them for a few days then they are worth a shot.  They seem well built and the sound is good for wireless if you get a good fit. But without the return policy, don't risk it as those three gel tips aren't going to accomodate everyone. It just feels like a poor design flaw to make everything hinge on the fit of the ear tips but not provide options to make sure that fit is great for everyone. I might try some foam options that are out there but none of those are rated well and this adds to the cost of an already expensive set of headphones so even if they do work I could never recommend this product to everyone. As much as I hate the design, I get why Apple went with the air bud design. There flaws are obvious and you know what you're getting going in. It sucks to drop this type of money on something labelled ""the best truly wireless headphones"" only to have them ruined by little pieces of silicone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They came in great condition. Once I put them in my ears and turned them on they gave prompts for Bluetooth connection. The Jabra sound+ app is helpful and allows for tuning so I would download if you haven't. I'm not sure what some reviewers were complaining about regarding sound volume as I use Sony 950B over ears and find the Jabra Elites to be loud enough for my taste. A tight fit allows for great sound isolation and the hear-through feature is awesome for when I am cycling. I do agree with other reviewers that the case should be magnetized to hold the ear phones securely when you open it as they tend to jump and I can forsee a few falls coming in the future.

On top of that, the headphones I owned didn't sound too great anyway so there wasn't much of a ""payoff"".

I've been meaning to buy a pair of wireless earphones but every time I went and looked they were either too expensive, had poor sound quality, or had poor battery life. The Jabra Elite 65t's seem to put a very good balance to all most of these by having both good sound quality and battery life, although many will find $160 to be a bit of a steep price to pay for any sort of earphones at all. I made the splurge and decided to go with these and so far have not been disappointed.

Two of my favorite features of these earphones are the ability to set passive sound so you can hear people around you through the built-in microphone, which works pretty well, and the ability to EQ your music. At first, listening to these earphones had me pretty let down considering I was enjoying the fit they had in my ears and the neat case they came in. After playing around with the EQ settings (which I recommend to use from my screenshot) it gave them a nice boost in sound clarity, much better sounding than the wired earbuds I have.

While I've only tested these earbuds for a few days, I've noticed that the battery life is pretty good, even after a few 5-15 minute phone calls while on my job I end up at around 80-85%. Mic quality seems to be okay as well, as I haven't heard any complaints about my voice sounding poor.

The charging case is also pretty slick and it's easy to drop the buds into their respective charging spots. I would have preferred for the charging case to be through USB-C as opposed to Micro-USB, but it does its job.

What I thought was going to be a $160 disappointment of a purchase ending in a return, actually evolved into a regret that I hadn't done it sooner. I really do recommend these earbuds, they're convenient, sound good, and last a good while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They sound great. I haven't played with a some of the features like listening to ambient noise etc, but music sounds great to me.
The earphones stay charged fine for my use. I rarely use them for more than 1 hour at a time though, so placing them back in the case works perfect for me to keep them charged.
Connecting them to a device is super simple compared to other wireless headphones I've tried.

The bad:
They do NOT stay in my ears during hard workouts - running or lifting. That was my primary need. I have tried all 3 sizes of caps provided with the headphones, and that makes no discernible difference. They initially seat tightly and feel like they create a seal (there is a slight pressure inside the ear if you push on them). Once my body heats up and I start sweating though, they will not stay in at all. I have had them fall out while running indoors and out, and also while lifting weights  at the gym - all of which is extremely inconvenient (almost had someone step on one when it fell out and bounced around the weight room while I chased it around)! I find I can manage them at the gym now that I am used to them, but I'm hesitant to wear them running as they are more of a distraction than anything else.
They cut in and out often enough to be irritating. I haven't actually timed it or counted it, but I'd say about 1 use out of every 5, for 5 minutes of the hour I use them, they break up and sound like a bad cell phone connection. I haven't noticed any repeatable pattern for it either. It doesn't happen in the same place or under the same conditions (meaning it doesn't only happen when I'm standing next to something that is obviously interfering).
If you want to only use 1 earphone, you HAVE to use the right one. That's probably not a problem for most people, but I am deaf in my right ear.

Conclusion:
This is the best pair of wireless headphones I have used, and I've used several from $40 to $200. I would recommend these headphones, but with the caveat that you should manage your expectations if their primary purpose will be for running or other vigorous activities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No sugar coat","Before purchase I was very positive and excited to try these out. I couldn't understand how reviews were worse than airpods. Now I understand. A product like airpods may be missing some features and may have slightly worse sound quality, but what airpods have that these do not is the refinement, ease of use, and a polished feel to them. I didn't think that was a big issue but now I see it's a huge deal. If you have an iPhone, and maybe even android, definitely consider airpods.

I'll start with the ultimatum if you consider it so; airpods are more comfortable than rubber tips. May change from ear to ear, but I consider my ears average / slightly larger. No ear wax issues, and my ears don't get sore. I still use these, because I can handle this downside.
(First pair)
Before and after firmware update, left side is slightly louder. Tried them in both ears. Sound otherwise is ok. Comfort is the best rubber tips can be, which is mediocre. I'll order some memory foam tips. The thing that really disappoints me is lack of quality control, some guy probably marked these as fine but in actuality there was a slight problem with balance between sides. If this is a software thing it's even sadder because they shouldn't have that problem after so long since release. Ill probably return and exchange these for a pair that are balanced properly

UPDATE:
new pair arrived, they work fine. I wont give 5 stars because setup wasn't smooth and they aren't as refined and are more buggy and glitchy compared to airpods. And because of quality control being poor, there are lots of online stories about the same thing.

But rage aside, now that everything's setup and working, they are honestly good. Too bad a $190 dollar product feels so unrefined, but once they are setup, things go smoothly. I'd price them @120, and the cheaper ones @100. Or at least the same as airpods at 150... If bugs were gone and setup was smooth, I'd feel better about 190

Final update: software is buggy. Down to 3 stars. My settings consistently do not save. For example, I've turned off pause on removal multiple times, and it randomly reactivates. Very frustrating.

I know alot of this makes them sound bad, but in the end I haven't returned em, I'll use them. Everything I didn't mention works great, pretty much I recapped the bad things. I am disappointed with the lack of refinement at this price point, but eh I got the money to put toward the best available for Android in hopes improvements can be made. Excited to see new development in this technology.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_313?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=313&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The passthrough audio feature is great if you're walking around amongst a crowd so you can keep an idea of traffic and what not. The ability to equalize your audio is also fantastic. That was a definite favorite of mine, as I prefer more bass. Being able to adjust it was a great option to include. To be clear, you 100% need to download the app to get the most out of these.

They’re very sleek and have great sound quality WHEN they’re working. That’s the issue.

I got these headphones in November and they worked great. In February my R earbud stopped playing sound out of the blue (although I could still use it to control both headphones). I called customer service and they offered to send me a replacement for the R earubud. It just arrived today (5 weeks later).

Right out of the box I had issues syncing it with my existing L earbud. After 35 minutes on hold with customer service, I got instructions on how to sync them and I got off the call. After following the instructions, the earbuds paired but now they intermittently GMCLA out during audio.

I spent another 30 minutes on hold and spoke with a different customer service rep who walked me through a factory reset and a language update. Before getting off the phone she provided me instructions on obtaining a replacement set via the manufacturer warrantee if the reset should fail (which it did). The catch: they won’t send me my replacement until I send in the old pair, and then I’ll have to wait god-knows-how-long for the replacement pair to ship - let’s assume another month.

Let’s do the math.... out of 4 months of ownership, I’ve spent 1 of them waiting and I’ll likely spend another month waiting before I have a usable pair.

Pairing was super simple, it can connect to 2 simultaneous devices, and sound quality is pretty good. It's not fantastic but it's good enough that I can appreciate my music. I use these everyday for listening to music at work and for conference calls and everyone has said my voice is pretty clear on the receiving end.

I do appreciate the ambient sound mode but I just wish it would notify you when you  enable/disable it. The ambient mode doesn't compare to my Sony headphones but you can definitely hear co-workers that are sitting next to you. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them everyday!","I use these at work and at home and have had very few issues at all. I love the sound and the pass through hearing is a great feature for the office. I have yet to ever run out of battery life as I always place them in the pod when not in use. I keep hearing about folks having static issues....not here. Music clarity is on par with my Beats Studio 3 headphones(wish it had a little more bass like the sony ear buds) and the phone call clarity is great in my noisy office. The only thing I do not like is the app....It's a bit confusing with the icons rather than just stating the action and setting the modes is a pain in the butt to go through multiple times to add or remove an action or EQ setting.....Overall, I love them and will recommend them to anyone who wants a quality set of ear buds","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_313?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=313&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Upon initial impressions I wasn't wow'd when going through the contents.  The earpieces while solid don't appear to be much; the plastic is soft, the case was a toy and the box was 99% space.  Seriously they could of cut down on box size considerably seeing as the case + earbuds + small box of wire/ear gells and pamphlet aren't that big...

I don't usually judge a book by its cover and I already knew the public outcry over how terrible the carrying case is so I moved on.  Packaged everything up and charged over night, getting them to fit in the case isn't hard it is fairly idiot proof but getting the case open royally sucks.  I don't listen/workout with the case so I didn't equate it into my rating.

Case - It has a battery, its a bit bulky and opening it is stupid hard.  I found that if you squeeze as you try to pry the lid open its easier but I feel like I'm going to crack the case eventually.  More of a nuisance than anything but this seems like a terrible design to let through on a niche/expensive product.

Sound - They sound good, the Air Pods IMO sound better, but these are good enough.  For the price I don't feel like I'm missing out.

Connection - to the phone (iphone 6S+) they are perfect, auto connection is seamless, quick and usually done before I get them out of the case and into my ear.  They connect to my Surface Pro but it won't let me utilize them as a sound source, what ever as that's not what I bought them for.  Connecting together its a bit wonky, there are some hick-ups with the LEFT ear connecting.  In fact this originally led me to believe that I had a bad pair, but the left ear doesn't always sync up with the right and you won't get anything from it, it either isn't turned on or its ""frozen."" I haven't been able to determine what actually causes this yet but the fix is to put it in the case and take it out again, that fixes it.

Fit - These have yet to fall out and I run a 5k daily + I do circuit training.  They fit in your entire ear, for me they are super snug and at first I wasn't completely sold on them staying in there.  With that said I do have some ear strain after wearing them straight for 6 days, often for multiple hours.

Call quality - seems good, did some video calling and no one complained.  There is no active noise canceling, they physically block the sound from the other side.  They offer a hear through option that in my personal/unprofessional opinion .... sucks.  Turned it off, its staying off.

App - helpful bits of info, offers limited control of the earbuds but control nevertheless.  I want to say its gimmicky but with the help section, auto updater and ability to turn off *hear through* is a big plus.

Touch controls - sensitive enough to not have to jab your ear drum trying to get them to press, but stiff enough to not accidentally trip Siri when you are trying to scratch your ear either. Intuitive, easy to understand, its also laid out in the app if you forget what does what.

I wanted to like the Air pods but they don't fit my ears, these do, these are also ""sweat proof"" which is more important to me than better sound quality.  To me they are worth the price despite having some small hickups and a terrible battery case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I read all the professional reviews and opted to buy these after I gave up on AirPods. I really wanted AirPods to work but they don’t sit securely nor do they have a good seal (more on that later). I owned them for 6 month and used after market silicone ear hooks to keep them in place when exercising. But in the end, because the AirPods didn’t crest a seal in my ear, I couldn’t hear my music when on the subway or while walking along a busy street. The Jabra Elite 65t solves most problems while only creating other minor ones. The “pause when you take it out” feature only works on the right earpiece so you can’t wear only the left. But this “problem” is mitigated by the listen through feature. The earbuds create a fantastic seal which blocks out a lot of ambient noise. By pressing the right earpiece twice, you can hear what is going on around you. The sound is a bit distorted, but you can still hear everything. This is actually a really great feature as you don’t have to take the earpiece out when a brief interaction is required. The only other complaint is that the left earpiece doesn’t connect when I take it out of the case. To connect the left, I have to press and hold the volume button on the left piece after the right has connected. I also with the earpieces were magnetic and held to the charging/carrying case like the AirPods. But these connect as reliably to my iPhone as the AirPods ever did. I have no battery issues and I do use them heavily. Love these and they never fall out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Left earbud drop out.  Won't stay connected with phone 2 ft away.. etc. etc. etc..

But(!) These things are great.  Paired them with my phone (iPhone 8) put the phone on my center island, and walk around my entire apartment with no issues at all.  Wear them on long walks (90 mins) and they truck along like no big deal.

The plastic housing is a little tough on the ears if I'm being 100% truthful.. but I haven't tried the other rubber earbuds yet, so maybe bigger or smaller would work.  and really I'm getting use to them.  They're secure in my ears and that's more of a concern for me.

 I also haven't tried the phone through these.  I didn't really buy them for that -- so no biggie.

Bought mine on sale for $119 which was about $50 less than the Bose.. so ... deal.

As far as sound quality is concerned, they seem fine to me.  Does it have the bass that a big woofer has?  no.  But, is it tinny or all treble?  No.  I hear little quiet elements in songs that I normally don't hear played in open air..  so I'm satisfied.

Comments:

I've had 3 pairs of the Elite Active 65t with no luck at all.  The first (purchased from a known retailer; Black Titanium) had the left piece remarkably uncomfortable than the other. It seems that it was slightly larger than the other earbud.  The 2nd and 3rd (purchased directly from Jabra; Copper Blue version)  had echoing/feedback issues.  Anyone on a phone call with me would hear a loopback of whatever sound they make, consistently. It's a major no go especially for mobile professionals that are always on conference/meeting calls.

TIP: If you already bought this product, ask the other person on the line if they hear themselves. There is no fix for this per Jabra, it's a defect apparently which requires replacement.

The tech support and customer service from Jabra were friendly but hardly impressive. Their replacement and/or return procedures takes around 2 weeks to processs (not counting 10 business days expectation for a refund).

I would not recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having my phone in my back pocket or in a running belt is no longer a problem: the connection remains strong and clear regardless of where the phone is on my person.  In that sense, this was a great purchase that appreciably reduced my general level of technology-related frustration. However, the charging case is weirdly hard to open.  The trick seems to be to squeeze the sides of the case firmly (just below the latch) while pushing up on the lid, but this is not at all explained in the brief picture-filled guide that comes with the device.  Are we now  assuming that most purchasers are functionally illiterate?  Why is it that every manual now includes as few words as possible and instead tries to convey information through stick-figure cryptograms?  Is this all supposed to be some sort of puzzle that will stave off mental decline in consumers at large?

I really like that you don't have a dangly necklace to worry about with these; especially helpful for mechanics, or anyone else who might not always be in an upright position during use.

I really would like to give him it a more than 2-star rating as it sounds decent and the headphone stays in place through vigorous workout routine (even stay put through Burpee!). However, the weak bluetooth connection did it in for the 2-star. Remember how annoying when the headphone jack start to malfunction in the old headphone and you need to jiggle the connector to get sound?  Using this pair  of headphone on the crowded streets of Hong Kong (which is almost everywhere) feels like that. Also when you walk pass shops with anti-theft installation, music likely get cut as well. Again, on the street of Hong Kong, that's very frequently. Noise cancellation? What noise cancellation??

The are also the root cause of a number of problems I faced. I am going to give these a week and if I can't find a solution, these are going back.

1. The earbuds come with three sizes of ear tips. For me, none worked! They are silicone but just don't stay in the ear. These earbuds do not have fins and mostly rely on a good fit in your ear canal to stay in place. After really shoving (painfully) into my ear canals, none of the supplied tips  provided that secure fit in my case.
2. The ear tips absolutely degrade the audio quality. I could hardly get any bass even with the EQ bass frequency set on high. Again, this is because of the inferior fit and seal of the included silicone tips.
3. The charging case will NOT fit the earbuds if you use a different set of ear tips on them. I tried using ear tips from my older beats earphones and they provided an infinitely better fit and sound quality but I have to remove them before charging these earbuds.

Jabra needs to include better quality ear tips with these ear buds. The ones that come with it are bad in every way possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_215?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=215&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I workout 4-6 days a week, Run often, cycle when I can as well. Besides having the right shoes for the job (look at my prior reviews).

Tech is another crucial thing to me, in particular, headphones. I've gone through many headsets over the years from inexpensive over the ears sets, to top of the line wired earbuds to even Bone Conduction (which do not waste your money on).

What I've found though is there are tradeoffs when trying to find the right headset. One might do great that wraps around your ears--but gets in the way of sunglasses. The BT range is weak, but the battery life is excellent, they fit great, but the sound is horrid. The elite active 65t has all the strengths I look for in earbuds with the most minute weaknesses I've come across in a package.

Sound: They are spectacular nearly a 10/10, but the Bose counterpart is just a tad better. If the sound is a dealbreaker for purchase between the two, don't base it alone on sound.

Fit: Perfect. I generally tend to swap out the base buds for a bigger one that comes with them; I didn't here. They never move, they never feel like they are about to fall out. As earbuds with nothing around the ear or some obtrusive wire getting in the way, they never interact with sunglasses or a hat even in the sold with a skullcap on, they are not hindered by anything.

Bluetooth: Night and day between these and the Bose counterpart. I get NO dropoff whatsoever with the Jabra while the Bose gets lost in the woods all the bloody time to the point of disconnecting from the device I have it paired to. Jabra is solid the whole time.

Battery: Solid 5 hours of consistent use is what they claim. I haven't pushed it that far yet, but if every claim Jabra has made of these has come true, then I don't doubt this will be the same.

Usability: The left ear controls volume and tracks surfing the right is for calls/pauses music/Alexa commands if you use that. Both buds have a microphone for calls and voice commands. Easy to move through music tracks even when using bulky gloves (as I have been using at the time of this review. It's cold winter here).

The only weakness here would be the price as these retail at an eye-watering $189. I think Jabra has knocked them down to $159.99 (which is what I paid for them), but still way too high. If they were around $100-$120 I'd tell everyone to go out there and pick up a pair, but not at the price they currently sit at.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Never had a manufacturer say that a replacement is on backorder.  Looking at online forums, this is a common issue.  Beware that support is not great fo these earbuds.

PROS
-Very comfortable and compact in the ear. The round shape fits snugly with minimal overhang. Lightweight enough that it doesn't feel like it will fall out. The included eartips work well for me. You can always swap the tips for something like the Comply Sport Pro Memory Foam Earphone Tips if you want an even more secure, noise-blocking fit.
-The dock works well. Earbuds fit in easily and securely. Undocking/docking automatically connects/disconnects from phone.
-Right side is the master and can be used without the left side (slave). Right side controls start/pause which works great for podcasts.
-Audio sync between left and right is flawless. No issues so far.

CONS
-None so far.

COMPARISON to the similarly designed Sony SP700N
-The Sony works well but I prefer the Jabras.
-The Jabra fits more comfortably and snugly in my ear. The Sony is elongated and hangs out of the ear a bit more.
-The Jabra master earbud button controls start/stop while the Sony master controls noise cancelling which is not useful to me. I prefer the Jabra here for the times I want to use only one earbud.
-The Jabra is much easier to dock than the Sony.

OVERALL
These Jabras are a great choice for wireless biaural earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_403?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=403&reviewerType=all_reviews"

OK charging case","I've been a user of the Jabra 65t headphone for over a year now.  I use them multiple times every day for phone calls, listening to podcasts and listening to music.  I have been extremely happy with their performance, and would buy them again without hesitation.

They are easy to setup and pair -- I use them regularly with my Samsung phone, iPad and Windows 10 laptop. They can maintain a connection to two different devices at the same time.

I find them comfortable to wear, and I *hate* the fit of most earbuds.  For me, they either always seem to fall out when I move, or are painful after 10mins or so.  These stay put in my ears, even while walking and hiking. (I'm not really a gym guy, so I can't comment there.) I have also worn them before for >8hrs without any pain or discomfort.

Sound quality is really good.  Typical to most wireless headphones, the bass is a little light, but I find them comparable to my Bose set, and my other wireless headsets.  These have become my favorite pair.  They don't seem to block sound much (and aren't active with white noise), but perform well with phone calls and cutting down on background noises.

I use the Jabra app on my phone for equalizer and user settings, and have applied several firmware updates without any issue.

The ear pieces function well as a pair in stereo,  or the right ear piece (master) can be used alone with the left one in the charging case.

The case.  Conceptually, it is a great idea. Solid and durable,  they protect the headset well, and do a great job of quickly recharging the ear pieces.  Unfortunately the closure design could use some improvement. It relies in a plastic tab to keep the case closed and locked. When new, the tab is tight and the case hard to open. After use, the tab bends and eventually breaks off -- so the case will no longer stay shut on it's own. Over the past year I have gone through three cases -- and at $70 each on Jabra's site -- I have now spent more on replacement cases then the headset cost. As I write this today, Jabra is out of stock and my newest replacement is on backorder.  I assume that many others are having the same challenge.  I really hope this design is improved in the next iteration -- they rely on magnets to turn off the ear pieces, so I would think a magnetic closure wouldn't be too difficult to engineer. For now I am relying on tape to keep it closed so the ear pieces can charge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Jabra active elite are sweatproof and Airpods are not
2. Jabra has a longer battery life
3. Jabra sounds better for listening to music
5. Airpods are super easy to use within Apple ecosystem
6. I felt Airpods fit better while Jabra's gave me a slight ear pain after extended wear.

In the end I think both are high quality earphones. For ease of connectivity and overall use I will buy Airpods but if this is going to be your primary and only headphone, I will possibly buy Jabra.

Almost everything was great – the sound quality, the microphone, the ease of pairing, etc.  Noise cancellation worked well, though the ""pass though"" mode, or whatever it's called, cut out for a second a every minute or so giving the strange sensation of the sound of the outside world ""skipping"".  There was one dealbreaker for me though, which is that none of the earbud sizes fit properly.  The medium was too uncomfortable, and the small fell out.

I ended up purchasing and keeping the Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones (not the true wireless ones).

Only occasionally does it move around, and only once in 2 months of active use has an earbud fallen out completely (compared to EVERY time with wired earbuds for me, this is a borderline miracle).

The ""hear-through"" feature is awesome, and it's great to be able to tone down loud traffic. I was concerned there would be issues with Bluetooth connectivity, since I've used cheap semi-wireless headphones in the past that would drop out even if my phone was in my pocket.

So, in what felt like a last ditch effort, I went for the Jabras (Costco $149). THEY. ARE. INCREDIBLE. They stay put, block out outside noise, have a decent iPhone app and deliver better sound quality (for me, at least) than either the AirPods or Galaxy Buds.

I love that you can go five hours in between charges and that with a short 15-minute rapid charge you can get one hour of talk time.

The Jabra Elite 65t does take a little getting used to when it comes to controlling them. The buttons are right on the face of the earbuds and sometimes when putting them in you turn them off or when adjusting the volume. Also, note that you can use they are meant to work together. The right one is the master and it “talks” to the left. You can use the right on its own, but the left will not work independently.

The sound is fantastic, and I love that the earbuds seem to cancel out all other sounds around you. You may be able to hear a little bit of what is going on, especially if it is a loud noise.

The ability to tailor the sound to your needs with the equalizer in the app really helps. They came fully charged in the box, I paired them with my Google Pixel 2 in five seconds and was listening to music shortly thereafter. When I first put them in my ears, I was using the middle-sized buds, which sounded so-so (very little bass). But I tried the larger size and that made a world of difference - the bass punches. They fit snugly, but not uncomfortably. I don't think I could wear them all day, but that's not why I bought them - I bought them to listen to music while running & working out. If I'm working at my desk all day, I'll use my over-the-ear headphones. Bass response is full and mid/treble ranges are warm & beautiful. I tried metal, jazz & classical - all three sounded the way I think they should. No complaints whatsoever. I haven't tried them for voice calls yet, but I have no doubt they will be fine. I'd highly recommend.

Update - 8/2/18 - after wearing these a few times, they are even more comfortable. And I'll take back what I said previously about not wearing them for very long. I've had them in for nearly two hours and they are not uncomfortable at all. In fact, the bass response on them is as good as, of not better than, my Bose over-the-ear headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1 - Most are not very comfortable.
2 - I have trouble keeping them in my ears.
3 - I have heard that many people get ear infections.
4 - The sound quality isn't especially good.

Still, when I'm driving my car, my cigarette lighter no longer works, so I'm unable to keep my blue tooth speaker charged and listening to my Audible book library is not as nice as better speakers would be. My only choice is to wear headphones, but that is not very popular with law enforcement. So, I gave these ear buds a try.

These are the most comfortable, best sound quality ear buds I have ever tried. Their design includes a method to lock them into the ear that does provide a solution to my worries about them falling out. Spare ear bud covers are provided that helps with sanitation.

Another nice feature is the recharge on the fly case. You simply put them in the case and they recharge. I'm not sure how often this battery pack needs to be re-charged, but it does partially address the one shortcoming of the Jabra Elite, Alexa-enabled ear buds.

There is only one drawback: the promised charge life is only five hours. Usually, this is enough. But my wife and I frequently drive across country. On those days, I guess, I'll just have to work around this shortcoming.

BOTTOM LINE

i would rate them five stars except for the limited battery life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_411?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=411&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- The gestures aren't typical for iPhone buds. The left earpiece has two buttons (or rather a rocker), and gets used to control volume, to skip tracks forward and back, and to check the battery status. The right earpiece has one button, and gets used to pause/play, to manage phone calls (including hold and decline), and to manage Bluetooth and turn the set on and off.

- If the buds are separated by much more than the width of a head they will go into pause mode (which is a huge feature if you want to take out one bud and talk to someone). But, if they are put back near each other (like, on a nightstand), they will unpause. If you want explicit pause you have to push the button on the right bud (I got burned by this a couple of times before I figured it out).

- The ergonomics can be annoying. If you press in the center of the right bud while trying to settle it in your ear, you can accidentally turn the set off. It is slightly hard to tell which is left and which is right on the first glance (the ""L"" and ""R"" are small, and black-on-black. But the left bud is the one with the rocker pips).

- The charging and pairing setup means you have to keep track of and understand three different sets of LEDs, two on the case plus the lights on the buds themselves. In five different colors.

- The quick start guide in the box is almost pointless, inasmuch as it skips all sorts of important information about how to use the buds, and is in annoying IKEA-esque graphics.

- The bass response is weak.

- There are only three sizes of eartips, and, if like me, you wear a small-and-a-half, this can be less than ideal.

Download the app!  It has an equalizer, a better and more comprehensive manual, and all sorts of other goodies, including an option to update the firmware on the buds themselves. Sometimes these kinds of apps are just nudgers to try to get you to post ads for the product to Facebook. This one is actually useful. (Except for the eartip problem).

They looks really good, they feel nice, the charging case is a nice size (albeit difficult to open most of the time), and the sound is really good! Walking through NYC, I could barely hear the traffic. The hear through feature is pretty nifty too, though I didn't use it much at all. But I actually returned these earbuds after a few days solely because I could hear my feet pounding the ground with every step I took. It gave me a headache! And given that I bought these to use on the treadmill, that just wouldn't do. Even walking casually from place to place it drove me nuts. So I had to return them. Perhaps the fit wasn't quite right (I did try the various sizes of earbud tips to no avail).

Walking around not being able to hear what's going on around me was different and I almost returned the earbuds. I then downloaded the app, and discovered the best setting that allows the microphone to pass through the sound around you to the earpiece, even slightly during a call or listening to music.

Almost all of them have had ""high-end prices"" with ""low to mid-end quality"".
Before I go in the detailed review, look at Skullcandy, Soundpeats for same sound quality if not better at a much lower price or Bose for high-end headsets. But stay away from Jabra.

Jabra has consistently fallen short of greatness, with almost every product they make. They likely have smart Marketing (well there is some doubt about that too) who defines a good product and really bad engineers who do not know how to meet the requirements. In the end, almost every Jabra product has fallen short for the price I pay for them.
I should post a photo of my Jabra product graveyard (for some I could not return).

I picked these up from a local electronics chain store here, and once again, I returned it 3 days later.

When Jabra come up with a new product, they advertise and cover it well, and when it gets in the hands of the consumers,  reality hits. Let me cover few major requirements for a consumer.

COMFORT - as always, this is once again not a comfortable headset to wear. Look at Bose if you want hours of comfort or Skullcandy. Their rubber/ silicon quality if odd where it is harder than many others. So yes, after a while your ears will start to hurt. This was true to the three other headsets I have owned.

SOUND - Well they are OK in sound. very bass-y sound, I would say (Jabra, bass does not make a good quality headset). And then the left earplug had some odd flat sound response. I felt like I am having stereo effect of a stereo sound.

BATTERY LIFE - Yeah well, 5 hours under ideal conditions. For me they lasted a little over 3 hours. And that whole 15 hours claim with case is stupid ... Yes, I got the case too. 15 hours with case ? Well Marketing be damned. When it is charging in my case how am I listening to them? Just say that the case holds 3x the charge.

MATERIALS - yes, they look cheap to me. Jabra has always has had plastic-y headsets and they do this metallic satin finish to make them look great.

Stay away from this brand.
Save money and buy a Bose next month. Or buy a Skullcandy and put the remaining money in your savings account.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For my work I am on the phone 10+ hours per day. I didn't get them for music and working out. They are comfortable.

However, people I am calling or have called me complain that they hear their voice echoing and is really annoying to them. I contacted Jabra support. They ran a couple of tests and determined more than likely it was a defective pair. They had me work with Amazon support to further diagnose problem, which I thought was very strange. Amazon support was excellent and determined they were going to ship me a new pair.

The new pair arrived and were fine for a day or two and then callers started complaining again. The next several days complaints increased. Then I had an epiphany. The buds are small and there are 2 microphones on each one. Was it possible that the microphones were picking up the sound from their own speakers thereby causing an echo / feedback? I turned down the volume and that did decrease the number of complaints substantially, however I had to turn it so low that if I had any background noise I couldn't hear them. This sounds like it is a fatal design flaw. Therefore I'm returning this second pair and going to start from scratch looking for another ear buds. This is too bad, I really wanted to like these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fortunately got my money back on those, but it took some persistence. Nevertheless, I bought these after the cheap pair and couldn't be happier. They fit my ears perfectly and the sound quality is more than acceptable. Perhaps not every bud out there is going to work for every user, but these are great for my use, which is mostly for the gym. To that end, I pair these with my iPhone 8s and I can roam about my modest gym space (20-40 yards) without having to also carry the phone. I just press/hold the button on the left ear to skip songs or to adjust volume. A simple tap of the right bud and the music pauses while I make small talk. So, yeah, I'm giving these 5 stars. They perform perfectly for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I'm driving down the high way, using the hands free microphone to talk with others through my cell phone, they randomly become unusable.  While driving there is a considerable amount of road noise, and typically they perform very well with canceling the road noise, until it doesn't.

The person on the other end of the phone call will say ""Your voice is crystal clear, I can hear you perfectly. "" and then 10 seconds later they will say ""What did you change, I can barely hear you.  It sounds like you are in a wind tunnel.""

This is very difficult to deal with because the problem doesn't increase linearly.  The noise is either fine or so terrible the other person has to turn down their volume because it is too loud.  Unfortunately I'm stuck using my $25 ""cheap"" headset to talk with people when I'm on the high way.

I've contacted tech support and they've been unable to fix the problem. It’s disappointing the noise cancellation works until it doesn’t.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A couple of things to be aware of...","I bought the Elite 65t during the Black Fri, getting a good deal (119$). They replaced the apple earbuds which I used until I got rid of my iphone. I'm using them on a Pixel3. Below my considerations:
1) Built - The buds' material is pretty good, and the design is pretty nice. They are not touch, but they have button controls which allow you to do basically everything (i.e. volume control, siri or google assistant, open/close calls...). Only downside of that, is that you have to push pretty firmely, and I found that not very comfortable, as pushing on the controls will also push the buds into your ears. This being said, I don't use the buds' controls a lot. So for me this was not a deal braker. The case looks pretty cheap. I don't like the closing mechanism at all. It seems that it's going to brake anytime (although I haven't heard of anybody saying that it broke up yet). It's not magnetic, so the buds will fall if you leave the case open, or if it opens accidentally (this was a small thing which could have improved the product a lot). Last but not least, charger is not USB-C.
2) Sound - Sound is great, very clean, and you can adjust the equalization from the app. They also have features such has hear through, which activates the mics to let you hear voices or sounds while you're listening to music (without activating this feature, they're pretty isolating). While you listen to music, you can distinguish all the instruments. I'm still very impressed from the sound. Same thing with the calls: the voice sounds great, and the other side hears you very well.
3) Connectivity - Not hugely impressed. They never lost connection from the phone. However, pretty often happens that one of the buds disconnect for a fraction of sec. Sometimes that happens 4 to 5 times in a raw, which becomes pretty annoying. I've noticed that it happens when I'm in the subway train, or close to the subway. This is one of the things which could be a deal braker. However, it's not happening very often, so for now, it's fine.

Overall, for the price I paid, I believe they're a good pair of buds. There are some downsides. However I'm a musician, and the sound quality for me is kind of a priority, so I'm fine if I have to be a bit more careful when I open/close the case, or if one of the buds disconnect for a millisec when I'm in the train, as long as the sound quality is great as it is (and as long as the disconnect issue is not something that starts happening more often). For 119$, it is def. a good deal. If you have to pay more than that, you should probably start thinking about what's really important for you. One thing I can say is that, I don't believe it exists a pair of true wireless buds which are perfect. So it's really choosing which one is the best for you (at least for now).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_311?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=311&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here is my initial impressions and will give a further update later.

Background:
I'm travel weekly and have been looking to have good set of truly wireless earbuds to use while on a plane and in the airport. Having the ability to listen to music as well as take calls while traveling through the airport would be great.

The Jabra Elite 65t's have very good sound quality, great call clarity and battery life, although many might find $170 to be a bit pricy. I can say the price is worth it and so far have not been disappointed.

The sound quality is simply superb and rivals my Bose SoundSport® in-ear headphones.

Favorite features are “HearThrough” so you can hear people around you through the built-in microphone, which works pretty well, and customizable EQ for music.

While I've only tested these earbuds for a few days, I've noticed that the battery life is very good, haven’t run down battery yet, and haven’t had to charge the case either. Mic quality seems to be good as well, as I haven't heard any complaints about my voice sounding poor.

The charging case is small, taking up very littler room in your pocket. It is easy to drop the buds into their respective charging spots. I would have preferred for the charging case to be through USB-C as opposed to Micro-USB, but it does its job.

Pros:
Nice small compact earbuds that seem to last with a charge.
Use has been limited so far but the earbuds seem to stay well in the ear.
The controls on the earbuds. Seem to be easy to use.
HearThrough works pretty well when volume level is at 50%. I like the music mute option better.
Paring was seamless and painless. They connected to my iPhone X very quickly and haven’t had any issues as of yet.
Like the fact that the earbuds can connect up to 8 devices to the earbuds. I have two iPhone that I use daily (one personal and one for work). They connect to both as soon as I remove earbuds form charging case.
A voice command via Siri has worked fine. Have not tried with Alexa yet.
Sound quality is excellent. Smooth equalizer setting works perfect for my sound taste.
Voice communication is crystal clear as well. Other people on the call haven't had any issues hear me clear.
Noise reduction is great as well, even in loud areas.

Cons:
Earbuds seem to hurt my ears a little after wearing them for more than an hour.
Buttons could be a tap type instead of having to press. Sometime feels like I am jamming the buds into your ear. With that it sometimes causes the earbuds to become loose in the ear. I have to adjustment them again.

Final Comments:
I wish I had bought these sooner. I really do recommend these earbuds; they're convenient, superb sound quality, good quality, have nice added feature and a long lasting a battery life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These aren’t bad headphones. In fact, the sound great, pair awesomely, and have a stupid long battery life. However, I HATE how these fit in my ear. I’ve had pairs of earbuds like these and they always squeeze out of my ear which is really annoying. I’m going to make myself a few foam eartips out of cheap earplugs in order to get the fit a little but better. Other than the horrible fit (for me, might be different for you), these are awesome true wireless earbuds. Let me slap in a few pros and cons.

Pros
- Awesome sound
- Helpful app with EQ and step tracker
- easy 1 time pairing
- Wonderful ability to stay connected (I actually forgot I didn’t have my phone on me and walked away from them only to realize that they were still working on the other side of the house)
- light and compact charging case
- Excellent build quality

Cons
- Doesn’t fit my ear and no (good) foam eartips on market
- Case attracts sweat oils (easy cleaned)
- Case can be easily lost as it is kinda small
- No magnets in case which allows earbuds to fall out if case is opened

Update:
Ok, so I wanted to give these things a chance, but the fit is just absolutely horrendous. They fall out of my ears no matter which eartip I use and I’m sick of it. I’ve gone out of my way to attempt to find a solution to fix the problem but there is seriously nothing. If your ear doesn’t fit any in-ear style headphones, DO NOT BUY THESE. THEY WILL NOT FIT YOU.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_348?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=348&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I downloaded the app, updated the firmware and adjusted the EQ to maximize sound as much as possible. Then tried them with 3 different devices (PC, Android and Apple) and got the same results each time. I bought these primarily for media consumption so did not test call quality.

My first impression was that they are much smaller than I thought they would be. Build quality is ok, but they are primarily plastic and somewhat cheap feeling. Fit is ok, but I'd like to see some better tips, these are very thin and don't help with noise isolation. I'm no audiophile, but I know what I like and did not find it here. The sound is just ok. Volume level is pretty low at max and not loud enough to drown out noise from your surroundings. Bass is almost non-existent even when turned up all the way on the EQ. Mids and highs are clear if you can get the volume up loud enough to hear them. Honestly, I have $30 headphones that sound better than these at 6 times that price. If these were $30, I wouldn't be leaving such a negative review. You expect less for a lower price point and more for a higher one.

I purchased a set of Bose Soundsport Frees at the same time as these because there seems to be a lot of comparisons between the two. Let me just say that these aren't even in the same class as the Bose and no where near worthy of a comparison. I was very disappointed with these and will be sending them back in favor of the Bose.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have to switch to corded earbuds while they recharge. Pain. And lastly, (3) the design is very clunky looking when in the ear.

Here’s the review:
The Good:
1. The form factor is great. I love how snuggly they fit in my ears, extremely low profile.
2. Battery life is okay as well.  They’re as good as any other truly wireless headset in it’s class.  They give me about 2.5+ hours per charge.
3. The Charging/Storage Case is well designed.
4. The “sound pass through mode” is a great idea, and works well often, but not always, as explained below.
The Medicore:
1. Button Functions Not Well Thought Out.  One thing I loved with my AirPods was that I could use either the left or the right, switch on the fly, and either could pause or play music.  With these buds, the right side has a play/pause feature, and outside sound pass through, and the left side has volume functions.  So you can’t really use the left only. You need to either use both or the right one alone as a practical matter.
2. Sound pass through buggy.  For some reason, when in the exterior sound pass through mode, often I hear buzzing in my ears. I think the buds are picking up some outside noise and converting it to buzzing.
3. Sound is very high in treble.  The sound is very tinny, not well balanced.
4. Often the left earbud doesn’t sync and I only hear sound from the left.  I have to put them back in the case and take them out to get them both to work.

The Bad:
1. They don’t work well with either Siri or dictation on my iPhone.  My AirPods worked flawlessly with Siri and dictation, but these don’t pick up much of what I’m saying well and the words are distorted.  This is a huge problem for me.

In sum, while they look much better than AirPods, they are still inferior in terms of sound quality and functionality.  I think the earbuds need work for iPhone use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_390?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=390&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are AMAZING!! They rotate into the ear and have 3 different sized cushions for the perfect fit. They do slip slightly after getting a little sweaty but I have yet to have one go flying out of my ear while running. My only wish is they were a little cheaper as I did not want to spend that much money but I'm hopeful I will get my moneys worth out of a long time of usage. The buttons are a bit confusing but the app that aids in their use is a great tool. I also wish they came in a variety of colors or a way to change colors, especially with how expensive they were.

One problem..
The warranty for these is 90 days, my left earpiece sounds very scuffed as if the internal speaker is blown. Soon after the 90 days (conveniently), this issue started.

This means either
A) I got a defective item.
Or
B) They are made to only last a few months  of wear and use past the warranty.

Slightly disappointed because they worked so well.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is totally objective. Let's start with cons:
Too expensive for such a quality.
Don't be fooled by Alexa promotion as well.
It's not touch activated pressing buttons will hurt your ears.
Not comfortable material.
Poor design.
It worth about $35 -$40 at most.
No better sound quality than other cheaper products.
No good instructions I wouldn't know I have to update its firmware if I wouldn't find out there is an app.
You will hear noises all the time.
Overall 2.5 over 5 not worth to spend this much money.

Pros:
Well it is wireless
I never heard complaints from other side when I was on the phone they heard me well.
Battery life would be a pro but you can get the same from another cheaper product.

First time I am not happy with an electronic device I have bought from Amazon. I will not return it but I will be more careful with this brand. I just fooled by Amazon's Alexa promotion when I buy this. It turned out you could do that with any earbud nothing special. So, don't buy this product until it reduces to reasonable price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The styling and feel of the earbuds were great, it certainly felt like premium quality. However the earbuds, and weight of the earbuds were a deal breaker for me. They were uncomfortable to have in the ear for longer than 30 mins. My ear canals would start hurting it felt like the ear canals where being expanded to the point of severe pain.

THE FIRST TWO PAIRS
In the first pair (which was in a sealed retail package), the sound was very slightly skewed to the left side (aka slightly louder in the left ear). It made it sound like the center of the sound was behind my left eye if that makes sense. It was a subtle thing, but maddening. RETURNED

The second pair, (which came in an unsealed box (no sealing tape on the retail packaging)), had a HUGE off-center bias to the left. The right headphone was barely audible at times, and full volume would cut in and out when I tried to adjust the fit. Also, the firmware update got stuck in what I'll call a boot loop. It would download, and then ask me to put the buds in the case to load it, which I would do. Then nothing would happen when they were in the case, so I'd take them out and it would tell me to put them back in the case again to do the update. I did the 10s reset of the right earbud, cleared the app cache and reinstalled, all to no avail. RETURNED

(I tried contacting Jabra customer service on the first issue, and days later I still hadn't heard anything, so I just started exchanging them.)

THE THIRD PAIR
Finally on the third pair, I got a sealed package again. Before even putting them in my ears I connected them to Bluetooth through the Sound+ app first, plugged the case in for a few minutes, then wiped (clearing cache) and reinstalled the apps (Sound+ and JabraService), then downloaded and installed the firmware update. These ones worked perfectly with balanced sound!

PROS
• Solid sound, fairly flat sound stage, maybe leaning a bit bass-y, and quite muddy for my taste. However, it's better than what I'd expect for true wireless buds. (My desk headphones are Audio-Technica ATH-M50x's for reference.)
• No cord to get snagged on things and to bounce around and pull them out of your ears when working out
• Tight fit - They really stick in your ears
• The app is well designed and pretty easy to navigate
• The HearThrough function to hear your surroundings is mediocre at best

CONS
• Micro-USB to charge the case (I hate everything that not USB-C at this point, so take that with a grain of salt)
• Tight fit - your ears definitely need time to get used to them
• Equalizer - doesn't seem all that effective","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The SOUND QUALITY is one of the things these AREN'T GOOD for!  These were my 7th pair of totally wireless earbuds, & the most expensive. When you consider the cost, these are ludicrous. Cost aside:
BAD: 1. THE SOUND! The sound is bad. The frequency response is pretty flat, but they distort along the entire range, even at moderate volume.
2. They don't get very loud.
3. They fit well, but even the smallest ear-tips are too big and hurt like heck. Despite the ritual of screwing them into the side of my head to get them inserted, they would still come out if I talked a lot or ate something.
4. THE PRICE! For this kind of money, these things should rock. They don't. They whimper.
GOOD: 1. Ambient sound feature, where you can hear sounds around you, is super cool. A thoughtful touch is that it comes on slightly when you're on a call, allowing you to hear around you, but when you put on music, it automatically turns off, unless you turn it on. More manufacturers should do this.
2. A good set of controls via the push-buttons on the units.
3. They look comparatively good, not hanging out strangely, & the little microphone extension fits naturally in a certain part of your ear, angled like you see in the pictures, and isn't protrusive
4. Of all my earbuds, people I called liked how I sounded to them the best. I tested all the earbuds I have, one after another, pairing and then unpairing, & repeating the same phrase to people I called to get their opinion of these (& all the others). These won.
5. Paired easily & wouldn't drop/had good range.

Tired of being a test lab for earbuds, I bought a collection, including these, to try and find a pair that were ""keepers."" THESE WERE NOT THEM. I could begrudgingly put with the cost if they were good. I could even deal with the pain. To have bad sound quality, & pay a lot? That was the deal-breaker. I returned them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them for my commute to work and exercising. Finding a pair of headphones that wouldn’t fall out of my ear was really important to me and I haven’t had that issue once with these. Sound canceling is phenomenal. I walk through the streets of Chicago by a train and can’t hear it much at all. Then there’s the hear through mode in case you want to use them at work or hear what’s going on around you. The battery life is fantastic, but keep in mind, you have to turn them off all the way once you’re done with them. My only complaint, is that if you take them out of your ears for a period of time, you really need to turn them off, put them back in the case, wait a moment, and then turn them back on. Otherwise you will get sound in one ear and not the other. It’s such an easy thing to work around that it doesn’t bug me at all. Seriously.

Call quality was always very poor.  I could hear OK (but never loud enough)  but every single person that I have called, complained that the ambient noise that they heard made the call unbearable, therefore, I had to disconnect my bluetooth and hold the phone up to my face to complete the call.  Yes, their 4 microphones pick up every little sound, which is a disadvantage.  Now 3 months in, they no longer turn off when placed back in the case.  My phone thinks that they are still connected so I have to manually turn off bluetooth on my phone to make a call.  The bottom line is the case is poorly designed.  The felt like plastic and the positioning prevents the earbuds from making a good contact with the contact points.  My wife has a pair of Apple Airbuds (for the last 7 months) and they drop in the case like a glove, and the sound for calls is far superior.

I already contacted Jabra customer support and after performing their troubleshooting steps (didn't work), they sent me link for a return (at first they just wanted to send a new case, but who knows what's wrong with these).  So they are going to send a label and I have to mail the whole set in and then wait (they said around 10 days but I have no faith in that) for a new (& it better not be refurbished) set.  I'm not a happy camper.  Biggest Cons are:  Poor Case Design & Poor Call quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These true wireless earbuds get rid of the cords that are normally attached to the earbuds or headphones, which offers you a handsfree and cord-free experience. By securely fitting in your ears, these earbuds can shut down outside noise and help you enhance concentration while you are studying or working out. On the other hand, people around you cannot hear what you are listening to. This feature of Elite Active 65ts will also suit commuters.
Regardless of the benefits mentioned above, there are some downsides you might want to know before purchasing the Elite Active 65ts.
1. Sound quality. For those who like heavy bass, Elite Active 65ts might not be suited. However, leaving the bass sound aside, these earbuds still provide a high-quality, clear and rich sound. If you are not obsessed with the bass sound, you are likely to be satisfied by these earbuds.
2. Battery life. Elite Active 65ts have a long battery life, lasting up to 5 hours. The charging case, which is included in the product, delivers two extra charges and make the earbuds last 15 hours. In addition, featuring the quick charge, the earbuds can recharge their 1/3 of the battery in 15 minutes. You can store the earbuds in the charging case when you are not listening, and they are fully charged when you take them out later.
3. Design. Elite Active 65ts have a stylish and modern appearance, but some people might not like the earbuds’ earplug feature. Although this feature can isolate your ears from outside noise, this also can make you uncomfortable if you have never experienced earplug-type earbuds. Some people simply don’t like earplugs (my mother never gets used to them). One thing you can try is changing the size of the earbuds’ tips, as three different sizes are included. You might be able to find a comfortable size that suits your ears.
As long as you are used to the earplug feature, you will be satisfied by these completely wireless earbuds. Try the Elite Active 65ts and stay away from the stress of untangling the wires.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found the largest rubber pads worked the best and I used them for a couple hours sitting at my desk. Sound is great and “hear through” technology is also a nice-to-have feature and when turned off I feel they also had a pretty good noise cancellation effect. However, after the initial 1-2 hours of wearing them I struggled to get the left piece to stay in place and it fell out numerous times.

I was really wanting to like these but if they won’t stay in your ears and fall out just sitting still they unfortunately aren’t going to work for me. I also bought a pair of AirPods at same time and what they lack in features, adjustability, and overall uniqueness they totally make up for in fit and comfort – I don’t have any concerns with these falling out, even with rapid movements, and I feel no fatigue or pain after wearing them non-stop for hours. If you can get the Elite’s to fit your ear cannel then I would recommend but they just didn’t work for me.

Also, Jabra case is slightly larger than Apple and much harder to open. I do however like the more rubbery silicone feel over Apple’s slick plastic feel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

On an airplane with my AirPods, I actually had someone next to me ask me to turn them down. That’s how bad they bleed.

AirPods also don’t have an accompanying app that allows you to tweak the settings / modes.

Hear-through mode is excellent if you’re using these for traveling or exercise - or any situation where you’ll want to hear what’s going on around you but also your music / podcasts / whatever you’re listening to.

It’s so convenient not to have to take them out of your ears every time someone speaks to you.

Also - my AirPods fell out my ears all the time. The Jabras have too - but not nearly as much.

I already have a Bose pair (not completely wireless) so I want to get a pair that is truly wireless but cannot decide on either to get the Jabra 65t or the Bose truly wireless.  Since I already have a Bose pair, so I decided to try this one.

It did not disappoint me one bit, the best part I like is that you can adjust the sound the way you like it.  It stays on your ears even if you shake your head it will not come off.  It also does not stick out from your ears when you have them on so it looks very discreet unlike others that sticks out from your ears.

It is very clear when you answer phone calls, my friends say they can hear me very clearly and no background noise even when I am driving with the windows opened.

One thing I like to see Jabra add into this is to have a find my buds function so in case you misplace the ear buds, you can f8nd them as these are truly wireless and can be easily misplaced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_213?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=213&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit was either super snug or loose.  When it was snug, I had a weird sensation in my ear where I could hear my footsteps as I walked.  If it was loose, they felt like they were going to fall out any moment.  The fit was not comfortable at all.

The sound just seemed very hollow.  Nothing sounded particularly good.  The bass was weak and songs that have big hooks sounded small and didn't open up the way they do on other headphones.

I'm nearly 63, have only 15% hearing in my left ear, have two restaurants (lots of background noise) and go like crazy each and every day.  These earbuds have already made a positive difference, as I'm constantly on my cell phone.  These are nothing short of remarkable.  Clarity is vital when taking detailed information regarding catering for 250 guests or reservations for 25; these are performing flawlessly thus far.  It is early on, I realize, but I couldn't be happier at this point.

The only negative issue I've experienced is the left one falling out which was corrected by changing to a larger earpiece (three sizes come with your buds).  Instant fix.  They paired instantly, maintain the stated charge and recharge quickly.  Listening to music is a joy even though the bass is a bit on the low side for me.  Nothing to complain about, simply a personal observation.  I'm ordering a set for my son as a birthday gift, that's how pleased I am.

Music tracks can be paused, forwarded or reversed via small buttons on the earbuds.  You can even adjust volume from the earbuds.  There are other functions such as sound pass through and Google assistant, etc.

My only criticism is that the earbuds are not magnitized so that they would be better held within their case.

If you don't believe me on how GREAT these earbuds are, just do a You Tube search for Jabra active elite 65t and see for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound and fit are decent and the connection was solid but after every action or during music playback there was a hissing whitenoise from the left bud for 2-3 seconds which ended in a small pop.
Some reviews mentioned this and kind of shaked it off like it was some minor inconvenience but it is actually unbearably annoying.  Looking deeper into the issue it seems very prevalent and nobody seems to have a fix or even acknowledge it when its brought up in discussion. For the people that do mention it they also mention that the issue persists after two or three exchanges so this seems to be a pretty common issue. The hiss is loud enough that it muddies up the sound quality and ruins the experience. Even worse when there is no music playing and after every action or notification you are reminded that you are wearing earbuds by this obnoxious hissing assaulting your brain.
Im not sure why this major issue is not being discussed or getting any attention from any of the tech review sites or reviewers or when it is addressed it is made out to be not as bad as it is. I'm returning mine but if this issue is addressed i would be happy to try again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very quickly:

Sounds pretty darn good.  Not real bass-heavy, but nice sounding, completely satisfied.

Fits very nice in my ears, perhaps a bit too big, but they don't move at all; again, satisfied.

The app offers a ""pass-through"" option, which turns on the mics so you can hear the outside world better.  This is fantastic when needed.

Case is initially quite difficult to open, but once I realized that if you squeeze the sides while lifting the lid, the process becomes much easier.  Docking a star for that poor engineering.  Also, I am not a fan of the charging light operation.  One time it blinks, another time it doesn't; I really never am sure where the battery level stands.  Additionally, when the buds are placed in the case, again, I am uncertain if the buds are truly lined up with the charging dots...

My initial impressions are:

These were easy to set up and pair with my iPhone. They connect easily each by taking them out of the charging case or by turning on each ear bud - depending if I put them back in the case or manually turned them off.

I put them in my ears with the medium tips that they came with. Most of the time I use either medium or small tips. The medium tips have an excellent seal but bothered my ears. I use in-ear buds all the time but never realized what ear fatigue was. The medium tips didn’t really hurt but made my ears feel tired. I switched to the small tips and what a great difference. The buds actually were now comfortable.

Sound quality with these is pretty good for truly wireless buds. Of course not as crisp and with great separation that I get with my IEM’s but decent quality nonetheless. I used the app with the equalizer to change up and add more bass but honestly don’t hear any difference.

Call quality is usable. I can hear the caller perfectly and the caller can hear me okay - not great but much better than other cheaper truly wireless buds.

The controls on the earbuds are fine and work good - no issues.

The silliest part of this purchase is the charging case. I like that it’s small and that the lights are good signals. I hate that it doesn’t have magnets to keep the buds in charge. And the cover design is just bad. So far it works but I’m afraid that the small plastic clasp that hold the top tightly will wear quickly and not hold the buds in for charging. With the top price of these buds, you would think the charging case would be as good as all the cheap ones out there.

I can’t say how much time I get on a single charge, as I don’t ever use them to the point of running low. When done, I pop them back into the case, so they are pretty much always charged.

I haven’t had any problems with the left earbud not working, any disconnects or stuttering. The audio lapse with videos is only noticeable in the YouTube app. Netflix has no noticeable latency.

Overall, decent earbuds but for this price, should be “great” rather than just “decent”.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seriously, I am a fan of most things Apple, but I had to draw the line at the Airpods. I didn't have a necklace to match!

Enter the Elite 65t. I bought it for music, but it may force my Stealth into retirement. My experience so far; Nice look to these, professional and low profile! Easy set-up. Good battery life made great with the charging case. Sound quality good, but you need the right size gel to get the base you want. Passive noise canceling, again, the gel fit matters. The call quality surprised me, great on both ends. I actually had a friend that I chat with regularly noticed the call quality was better not knowing that I was on the 65t. Well thought out controls and quite comfortable.The sound app is very helpful.

They fit great in my ear,  with no feel of falling out while exercising.  When interested correctly into the ear canal,  they sound fantastic for an earbud. Very full sound in all genres of music. They charge quickly and connect very fast when removed from the case. I haven't charged the case in two weeks of going to the gym for an hour at a time.

Overall these are just great. But one annoying flaw that they don't mention in the documentation/description is that the noise filter (what brings out your voice and mutes other noise during a call) only works on an actual phone call, not on VOIP calls. So if you are using Google Voice, WhatsApp, Messenger, Skype, or any other VOIP protocol, you'll have to be in a quiet environment, as outside will be very loud for the person you are calling. My spouse said that things like passing traffic or even running water from a sink were very loud and disruptive to our conversation. So just keep this in mind if you make a lot of VOIP calls.

A quick search will show plenty of users with this same issue.  Currently waiting on Jabra's customer support to respond; but based on comments from other users, that doesn't sound to promising.

Super fast Bluetooth pairing on IOS.","I've recently been in search for the perfect wireless earbuds to exercise in.  I’ve tried PowerBeats3, BeatsX, Bose SoundSport Free, AirPods for running / gym sessions and they have all disappointed either with fit/comfort,  sound-quality, and/or sweat-water resistance.

My main issue with the above is probably the ability for them to stay in my ear while working out or running (PowerBeats3 stayed on my ear, but never kept its seal in my ear so sound quality was terrible, plus the wires get sticky with sweat).

The “twist” lock of these Jabra Elite Actives 65t ensure they stay in my ear no matter what I do...so secure not a single adjustment is needed during workouts. They simply stay put. Amazing! AND they are COMFORTABLE! I knew I wanted to stay away from anything with wingtips (like the Jaybird) because historically, wingtips hurt my ears. So no wingtip fit is an important feature of the 65t.  If i don't need a secure fit (example at the office), I just slip them on without twist locking them and they stay comfortable all day.

I had concerns about Bluetooth connectivity (I’m on APPLE ecosystem), but I have had no issues with automatically connecting out of the charging case (synced to 2 devices at a time)...by the time I remove them and put them in my ear, they are connected. Not quite AirPods convenient, but damn close. Charging case is small, sleek, and fits in my pocket beautifully.

However it happened when I left the earbuds out without use for a long period of time. The first time upset about it, but realized that it resyncs when I put the earbuds back in the case before using them. They don’t have noise cancelation, but the sound isolation does a good enough job. The hear-through feature does an awesome job of allowing ambient sound back in when you want it, which helps me when I’m walking around the city. Buy with confidence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_314?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=314&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  Bad: App (Android) is buggy, weight is a bit high, inserts could be better

I bought the last version of these (Jabra Elite Sport) and had to return them because they didn't sound great and were not comfortable.

These are a lot more comfortable but still heavy and after a couple of hours of wearing them, you definitely know they are there. In fact I knew they were there the day after wearing them. I think the reason is their weight which can probably be helped with some better earbud inserts (like memory ones).

At the end, the biggest problem for me was the software. The app would loose Bluetooth connection and start going crazy with notifications, while the earbuds were in fact still connected and playing music.

It's a shame because these earbuds have so much potential with their sound quality and dust/water resistance ratings. The battery life is great too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_312?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=312&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been on the hunt now for truly wireless earbuds for a few months.  I tried the Bose Soundsport Free's and these Jabra's and returned both pairs.

The Bose
-- excellent sounded quality
-- great charging case
-- serious bluetooth connectivity issues and lag (this was the deal breaker for me for the Bose)

The Jabra's
-- excellent connectivity
-- average sound quality
-- below average case

The Jabra's had absolutely no connectivity issues.  They never dropped and I saw no lag when watching videos.  The sound quality was disappointing though especially having just tried out the Bose for a week.  These were just thin sounding even when I achieved a really good seal in my ear and when adjusting the sound profile in the app.  The weakest link though was the case itself.  It may sound strange to mention the case, but since there are no wires and short battery lives, the cases become VERY important.  The Jabra case had three main faults.  1st - it was very had to open.  You have to awkwardly squeeze the top front of the lid to get it to release.  It honestly feels like you are going to break it. 2nd - the earbuds are not magnetically held in place inside the case (like the Bose), so when the case finally does flip open (remember you are having to put too much pressure on the lid...see problem 1) they WILL fly out. 3rd - the case charges the earbuds but doesn't have any charge level indicator on the case itself...it says that it has about 3 earbud charges in it when fully charged, but you never really know how much is left.

None of these individually are deal breaker problems, but taken in total mean that the Jabra's just weren't worth the money.  I returned them after a week.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought my jabra 65t back in March and used it extensively for working out and daily commuting. I'm a heavy sweater so the water proofing is a must. The sound is stellar. Very balanced. Pairing was easy and the controls are intuitive. The only qualm I had was if you did any high intensity or high movement workouts they would probably fall out, so the fit isn't perfect despite trying multiple earpieces.

I had no problems with the Jabras until about a week ago when during a core workout the left ear fell out no more than 2ft and hit the mat. The faceplate fell off and stopped functioning. I have had the earbuds for no more than 6 months. Customer support said accidental damage is not covered and gave me a coupon for my next purchase.

For a (at the time) $150+ pair of headphones, you'd expect them to last longer than 6 months. Follow that up with customer support who doesn't care and takes about 3-5 business days to respond to each response. You've lost a customer for life. 100% chance this customer service experience extends to their new line the 75t.

They have a more solid fit inside the ear and do a fair job of maintaining sound quality and volume. The bose soundsport free needed to be at nearly max volume while at planet fitness in order for me not to be able to hear the fans going overhead, meanwhile with these I can keep them at a more reasonable level.

The most important distinction though is that the bose soundsport free are currently incompatable with windows 10 and suffer from an insufferable number of bugs if you intend to use them with a windows machine. The bugs with the bose soundsport free include - video / audio desync, and constant dropping of the left earbud. These have been bugs since the beginning and are not showing any immediate signs of improvement. By comparison, I can use the Jabra elite with windows and my phone and have found no bugs or conflicts of any sort that could not be easily resolved.

The only feature that was better about the bose headphones was that the case was magnetic and opened much more nicely, but that was meaningless in the face of the Jabra's many other positive qualities.

In short, if you are considering whether to get these or the bose soundsport free I would  highly, highly recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lifting boxes for 12 hours straight.

  Connection to my cell phone is quick and easy right out of the box. As soon as you pull the right bus out of the case thereafter, it will connect automatically.

  Sound quality is excellent. Easily on par with my V-moda M100 headphones, though not as nice as my Sennheiser 85s. There is a bit of audio delay, unfortunately, so they can't be used with apps like Smule.

  They fit nicely, and I haven't had them fall out except for when I tried to wear them under my Shoei motorcycle helmet. Even then, they were comfortable, and only popped out because my helmet is very snug, so it gripped the buds when taking it off.
  Though, to be honest, it took some time to get accustomed to the things. The same design that keeps them locked in place can cause a bit of pain until either they get broken in or your ears do.

  The battery life is fantastic! As I said, I wear at least the right earbud at work, typically for at least 4 hours at a time, and they charge enough during my 20 minute break window to keep going for another 4 hours. It's absolutely brilliant. The only time they've ever died on me was when I forgot I was wearing them and didn't put them in the charging case. Even then, it was a quick 30 minutes in my pocket, then back to death metal.

  The hear-through technology is great when I'm walking around Walmart or something, and at times is even better than natural acoustics. However, if you work near machinery like I do, you'll want to turn it off unless you can dance to the sound of screeching and distortion. But, it's really easy to turn off in the app.

  Voice communication is crystal clear coming through the JE65's as well. I can't comment on what the other party can hear, but I haven't had any issues at all except people sometimes ask if I'm okay because I look like I'm talking to myself (I have shoulder length hair, so these things are invisible to onlookers when I wear them).

  Alright, so here's my biggest selling point. That's right, not the audio, not the battery, not the secure fit, but rather the unbelievable durability. I've used them for 6 months in a warehouse. I once dropped the case (with the left earbud inside) and the right earbud (which I had popped out to concentrate for a moment) from my pocket onto a concrete floor from 15ft scaffolding. The right earbud looks good as new. The case has some scuff-marks but opens, closed, and charges just like it's supposed to. I didn't find the right earbud until I had clocked out and used my phone's disconnection radius to triangulate the signal. Any audio device that can survive the kind of abuse my earbuds have taken deserves a 5-star rating.

  A word to the wise, place your JE65s in the top of the case, aligned with the mold, then close the bottom. Perfect charging connection every time.

  So, why should you buy the Jabra Elite 65s?

- Long lasting
- Tough and durable
- Very loud when appropriate
- Can be painful at first, but never falls out

So the sound quality to me is on par with Jaybird x2's and I really like the no wires.  They are barely noticeable when you have them in your ears.  The big issue for me that I cannot get them to stay in ear for more than a 1/2 hour of walking.  Either one or both will pop out.  I have tried each combination of the small to large silicone ear pieces and they just do not work for me.  Always had a problem with silicone so I have been using the Comply foam tips for several years.  The comply tips I have did not work well with the Elite Active.  I think partly because of the way they stuck out of my ear.  Comply has a new pair, TrueGrip Foam which do work.  I tested yesterday and had them in my ear for over an hour.  But the TrueGrip Foam fit very loosely on the buds so when you remove them the foam tip stays in your ear.  Easy to remove.  The buds will charge in the case with the foam tips on.  A big plus.  Hard for me to blame Jabra for my ear types.  If you order try them for fit as soon as you get them and make sure they work for you.
Edit 10/1/18  Contacted Comply about the TrueGrip Pro and they told me that they just released a different version called SmartCore.  Bought the variety pack which included two different styles, 2 pairs of the round and 1 pair of the sport style.  Tried the sport style and the earbuds never fell out over a run/walk for 90 minutes.  The only thing I noticed was the sport style caused the earbuds to stick out my ear a little bit more.  Also have to take them off for charging.So also been using the airbuds with the silicone ear covers and they never fell out of my air.  Major difference is the sound quality.  The airbuds do not sound as good as the Jabra's.  This is a good first attempt by Jabra but at this price point I feel they need too look at including 2 things in the future, 1.  Magnetic charger with a better closing mechanism on the charger (present one kind of cheesy for $180- earbuds, 2.  Foam tips should have been planned for the charger and included.  Many of the earbuds in this price range and above include both silicone and foam so buyers have options.  Sennheiser has a new pair coming out in October.  Price will be a little higher, but will be interested to see how they stack up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The good is that the sound quality is much better than most I have used before.
The comfort is good and for me can be enhanced with the comply ear tip ..the silicone that is supplied can cause discomfort over long use .

The Very BAD ... is that this noise cancelling as advertise does not seem to work .
You are able to reduce the noise around you etc..however it's all amplified to your recipients.  They all complain about every sound in my background being amplified.
So too I can hear their background noise way above them .
I have reached out to Jabra that has ask me.to reset ...having done all they ask it's the same ..additionally it has connectivity issues seconds at a time with phone in my hand .

In the end the only resolve from Jabra is that I send back to dealer for replacement..sad ..

Background noise makes these unusable in most environments go with Airpods.","I got these because Apple Airpods won't always stay in my ears.  These stay in my ears.  That's about all the good I can say about them.  I switched back after about three weeks of trying to use these.

I tried using them on the train, and it was hard to get people to hear me over the background noise.  I basically had to scream into the microphones in order to be heard.  Needless to say, I could not do that on the train, and it is not appropriate in most other environments.  Before I got these, people had no trouble hearing me through the Airpods that these replaced when I was riding on the same train.  Same thing happens in restaurants or other public places.

Basically, the only place these wind up working well are in a very quiet place.  That would be your own private space (like your office or your home) or a library, where you shouldn't be talking anyway.  Gee thanks.

Also, these do not connect consistently, and sometimes they stay connected to the device after you hang up the call, thus draining the battery even more quickly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now I ask Jabra for a refund, I think I've been patient and their response was ""you'll have to talk to Amazon"" and they offer to send a replacement set . I agree to the replacement set (no real choice as they wont refund my money), but I have to send back the broken set and ""wait for the process"" only this time, I get an email that says ""these are on back-order and you should have your buds in 3-4 weeks"".

But then they stop working.","I've gone through three pairs of the non-active Elite 65ts in the last year- two new, one refurb. Used them daily (non-exercise, just commute, while doing chores, etc). After 2-4 months every single pair had the same problem- the left bud would stop sending audio from the phone- sometimes it was still connected and could control volume but no audio 90% of the time.

When they work, they work great. Lots of options for fit, and when I found the right size, they stayed in the ear and were fairly comfortable, and they isolated sound well (not active noise-cancelling, make sure you understand the difference). HearThrough is a great feature and easy to toggle quickly. But then they stop working. Three times with three different sets of buds and cases.

Just ponied up for the Sony WF-1000XM3 which are expensive, quirky, bigger (especially the case) and I'm not a fan of the lack of volume control.

At first I was tragically disappointed in the bass even after using the in app equalizer, but then I decided to try the different ear buds and when I tried the large ones a magical thing happened, the bass truly appeared. Now they sound great! I also re-tweaked the EQ (see photo). They also do an ok job (not great) of blocking outside sounds

Comfort is o-k. Like a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, but once I've had more time to wear them I may edit this. The best trick I can offer to get good comfort is to suggest you don't over-rotate them into position - rotate just enough to get a good seal. In other words as you rotate the mic towards your mouth (clockwise in L ear, counter-clockwise in R ear), don't over do it.

Also a tip on opening the case -- pinch the sides just below the hinge line then pull open with other hand, very easy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_268?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=268&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love these earbuds, they're super tough and I use them all the time for indoor cycling, lifting, sitting around at home or work, on the bus, etc. I've dropped the case with buds in it probably 5 or 6 times now and it's still going strong.

I haven't had any ""left ear static"" issues either. I use a OnePlus 6 so maybe it depends on what phone you're using.

The call quality is average, but I admittedly didn't care about that when buying this. I can hear people just fine, but they say I sound a little distant, idk.

When I tried running with these, which was the whole purpose of my purchase, I was less than satisfied. I went on three runs to test out each of the bud sizes and none of them created a secure enough lock to keep them from falling loose.

I thought 5.0 would solve all the No device connected problems I’ve experienced with other (cheaper) 4.1-4.2 headsets but the 65T was worse. I’d get those messages while holding the phone in my hands. When you report problems to Jabra support they just blow you off. The second problem is the ear jells aren’t adequate to hold the ear buds in your ear. They lack the ear wings found on the Elite Active ear buds which would help to solve the problem of falling out of your ear.
As for the call quality it’s good. Just as good as my $10.00 ear buds that  you can find at a discount store. I also had a problem with the App installing completely. When you report any problem to support they just blow you off saying it works good on my phone. The app equalizer is nothing to brag about. If you have a iPhone it’s much easier to use the iPhone’s music equalizer to adjust sound levels.

Now, as soon as I take them out of the case, both earbuds turn on automatically so I haven't had any issues sense.  I love these for hiking and generally running errands but haven't used them to talk on the phone so no clue how well they would do.  I've worked out a few times in these and have noticed that sometimes they feel like they're going to fall out but not sure if this could be fixed with one of the larger ear bud covers.

Long story short I buy them for $140 dollars which is the standard price for them all across the board. I received them yesterday, everything appeared to be in order.  However, upon opening and testing them out, I noticed that the left earbud was making a really loud static noise. Assumed maybe I did not have them properly paired or maybe not fully charged. But after a few hours of trying to figure out the problem came to the conclusion that the left ear bud was defective. Could not get it to work with out a really loud static noise that could not be turned down. So second part of the story is that I go to exchange them and now they cost $90 more then when I purchased them. Now at $230, when you look at competing sites they are still only $140 and amazon told me that they can only refund me and not exchange. So now if I still want these headphones that I bought the extended warranty for, I will have to be an extra $90 dollars to do so on Amazon. If you ask me it seems like  a complete SCAM. 100% disappointed and 100% would not buy from amazon again in the same situation.

After having the Jabra elite 65 for almost 2 months I can feel comfortable to write a review. Well this is an amazing product. Start with the bads: my biggest fear is to loose them! And no matter how snug they get in your ear they can easily fall from a slight unaware touch. The microphone is good for conversation but it catches all noises around as well.. Regarding the hold in the ears, they hold good but I won't feel comfortable runing with them above a street grating or something.. That's the bads.. Now goods: looking great! The material is high quality even the case. Sound is the best I heard for a wireless earbuds. The control buttons and app are wonderful!

The sound quality is amazing but I had no worries in that department, with them having the Jabra name.
The set up was super simple and let us talk about the battery life for a second. 5 hours of battery life and 15 with the charging case!  Now that is what I am talking about!

Lot's of talk about the microphones not picking up a user's voice, the left sounding louder than the right, a constant hissing sound. I waited a month before posting this review and I can say that my experience has been none of the above.

I ride my bike to work every day. I have made calls while riding my bike. With a winter hat over the microphone. Have never had a problem with the person on the other end hearing me.

Sound quality is astounding. Ran multiple speaker tests and are near in sound range that is capable from my Audio Technica M50x. Obviously not the same in bass and sound movement, but pretty darn close for a pair of buds that have no wires.

They connect very easily to both my phone and my work laptop (windows 10 DELL). The range that I can move from the computer is astounding. Have taken walks around the office with no dropping incidents.

The sound quality issues I mentioned above almost scared me away. I have heard heard hissing at times, but only after I reconnect the left after just using the right. But the hissing goes away after less than 60 seconds.

I read that the Jabra app might be causing these audio issues, and i chose to not download and risk a drop in quality. I've had zero issues since and I would advise skipping the app as well.

Overall very happy with the pair. Hopefully they will last a few years before biting the dust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They check off so many boxes like good battery life, good sound quality, secure fit, adjustable music equalizer and and an app that has many features like hear through mode. Also call quality is pretty good and better than most other earbuds. There dust and water resistant IP55 or IP56 if you have the active version, and there pretty comfortable (especially if you use the comply foam tips). They also look really good particularly the active version, I really like the matte finish. The charging case is small and easy to fit in your pocket although I wish it was USB-C instead of micro USB, and it would of been nice to have the earbuds magnetically secure in the case. The controls are nice and simple, volume up and down on the left earbud as well as touch and hold to skip or go back to previous tracks. Tap once to play or pause music and answer or end phone calls on right earbud, tap twice to enable or disable the hear through feature, and tap and hold to trigger your voice assistant. I really like the hear through feature, and sound quality is pretty damn good. SO.... You may be asking your self why I gave these earbuds only a 3 star rating after all of the positive things I had to say... Well the big DEAL BREAKER for me is the persistent, constant, frequently audio dropouts. Now if I didn't have this problem I would have easily gave these earbuds a 5 🌟 rating. Even though they are Bluetooth 5.0 im constantly getting audio dropouts. And I also started having issues with the left earbud being lower in volume than the right earbud. It's inconsistent, sometimes they will be well balanced and other times it will happen again. I recently bought a brand new pair of the active 65t version and experienced the same issue with the Bluetooth stability. When I'm walking the music will cut in and out at least every 15 to 20 seconds which completely ruins the listening experience and it really frustrates me because I really wanna love these earbuds, however I paid 200 bucks for this product and the audio dropouts are just unacceptable. If Jabra could fix this issue with a software update or something I would gladly give the elite 65t a 5 🌟 rating..... But in the meantime I'm just waiting for the Power Beats Pro... 9 hour battery life, great sound quality and most importantly... GREAT BLUETOOTH STABILITY.  Fix this Bluetooth connection issue 😡 Jabra you have a great pair of earbuds don't let this issue ruin your image.  UPDATE 6/9/19: As I mentioned above these earbuds have so much potential. The sound quality is ok, although the bass could be improved. Mids and highs are pretty good. But like I said before the constant audio dropouts are so frustrating I just wanna take these stupid earbuds off and throw them against the wall. I realized that even when the phone is in my pocket I still get dropouts. It's even worse when the phone is in my left pocket, the music completely stops. I shouldn't be experiencing these issues with a pair of 200$ earbuds. And apparently Jabra isn't doing anything about it. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE POWER BEATS PRO TO COME OUT SO I CAN LISTEN TO HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND HAVE GREAT BLUETOOTH STABILITY","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good fit. Good battery life (about 8hrs at mid/low volume). Works very well as headsets for phone calls, too.
As for volume and battery life: That of course is dependent on your liking? With the good fit I found I didn't need to have the volume up to hear my music while working in a fairly noisy place. But if you like to blast your ears the volume will do it, but I am sure the battery will not last near as long.
Also, they have a ambient noise bypass. which is they will let other noises through so you can hear things around you.
Dislikes: Well don't really have any. Some might say they are to pricey but I say you get what you paid for. I have had other cheaper earbuds that just sucked in some way. Could have been low volume, or poor fit, or piss poor battery life.
Well with these you wouldn't have to worry about any of those problems.
IMO they are well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I dont use them to hear music at all. so, sound quality is not a big interest to me.
 the most important thing is the quality of phone calls and that was the only reason that made me buy these earbuds as jabra announced that with 4 microphones these earbuds cancel the ambient sound near you so the other part you're talking to would only hear your voice and not get distracted with other noises.
Actually thats not what happened!! I used these for only 2 days and everyone I've talked to complained that they cant hear me clearly because of the noisy sounds near me.
Im not saying they are bad. They are good but the thing that make these earbuds unique ""phone call quality"" actually dont exist.

Over all:
1)Sound quality is very good but not compaired to bose sound free (although, better than most of the true wireless earbuds in the market)
2) design is great but not suitable for people with small ears.
3) microphone quality is good unless ur in a noisy enviroment.
4) connection: good but, sometimes the left bud dont connect so you will need to put it back in the case, close the case and re-open it and take it back (not a big deal for me but other people might not like it)
Over all 7/10

*update*

Pros:
1. Noise cancellation is top notch.  It does a great job at drowning out surrounding nose.
2. Sound quality is amazing.  My music and videos sound great.  My calls were clear for both myself and the person I called.
3. Very easy to connect to my phone.
4. Easy to use (volume and disconnecting a call)

Cons:
1. THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE!  I was concerned because there are no ear hooks and they just sit in your ear.  You have to twist them to make a snug fit.  My ear aches after just one day of use.  Actually not even a full day.
2. While the sound quality is great I'm concerned that they will damage my hearing because they are in your ear vs. sitting on your ear.  I actually have a slight ringing in my ear that has not gone away.
3. They have fallen out multiple times.  I have twisted them as instructed but they began to loosen and I subconsciously tilt my head to try to hold them in.

I will be returning these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_321?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=321&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've always been afraid of wireless because I worried they would fall out and get lost.
I got these for Christmas and I am impressed.
1. First, and most importantly, they don't fall out when I run.  I have done 6 runs and they haven't fallen out once (after I figured out left and right, see complaint #1 below).
2. The sound quality is really good - not 'superb' like with my indoor headphones for music, but for sports headphones they are very clear.  I can choose to hear 'surrounding noises' when I run outside but turn that feature off when I run inside on a treadmill.
3. The App is easy to set-up and use on my phone.  I'm not great with tech and even I found it really simple.
4. I love that I can skip or repeat tracks without having to dig my phone out.  That is a big deal at the end of a long run when I just want to hear that one certain song that keeps me motivated.
I have two complaints:
1. It is hard (for me) to tell the left and right apart.  They will go in my ears either way, but if I get them backwards they will fall out after I start running.  There is a small 'L' and 'R' on them but with my eyesight I can't see it.  I'm going to put a drop a nail polish on one to tell them apart easier.
2. The case is hard for me to open with my older hands.  I have had to get someone to open the case for me every time so far.  I am hoping it will get easier after some uses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really do. I don't want to be another douchebag finance bruh with an airpod sticking out (literally) of their ears. It's a pain for me to walk to my midtown offices where you'll most likely see them powerwalk to their corner offices in their custom-made suits. I'm not about that life. So I decided to see what's out there.

Samsung? eh.. I do use a S9+ but I've never been a fan of their audio products. Bragi? seems too startup-y and worried about them not being around for too long.. Bose or B&O? seems like they're behind the curve with the 4.x bluetooth tech when 5.0 is available.. plus wasn't too sure about their water/sweat resistance considering my active lifestyle.. Jaybirds? I've used their ""wired"" bluetooth headphones but wasn't really feeling the look. So the only option left were the elite 65t and the active version and I chose the elite 65t simply because of the low-key colorway.

Setup
Pretty easy. I connected it to my Galaxy S9+ and 2 laptops and it was a breeze. Just a simple long-hold of the right side bud button and find it available on the various devices.

Fit
The small bud size that is equipped as the default wasn't creating a tight fit in my ears so at first, it sounded very air-y. after trying on the other earpiece options, I found that the largest one fit my ears the best and creates the ideal fit & outside-noise blockage.

Material quality
It's plastic. Everything's plastic. And I have no issues with that. One potential issue I see is with thin piece of plastic that holds shut the case. That thing was not designed to last so optimistically (opening & closing the case around 10 times a day), it'll last 2 years at most. I've learned to be very gentle in my approach.

Audio Quality
Very good. Companion app helps a bit with equalizing the low, mid, high (also you should probably download it to get the latest software updates). I generally listen to hip-hop, rock, classical and personally I think it covers the various genres very well. You really need to get a good fit in order to fully appreciate the audio drivers.

Day-to-day usage
Ok so here's where the story goes downhill and never recovers. Is it just me or is Bluetooth ""5.0"" just a blanket marketing term? In my old job, I've used Bluetooth 5.0 headsets (connected to PC) and walked around my office without dropping any audio (I actually went outside to the 1st floor just below my desk on the 5th floor and it still worked. amazeballs). I was expecting the same from these headsets. Instead the audio constantly skips when my phone is in my pocket. Ok.. maybe my pants are lined with some sweat-wicking materials that's interfering with the signals possibly? So i try on my suit pants (I don't wear full suits thankfully) to check and yup, still skip city. OK so I guess I'll just have to adjust my life to fit the needs of the phone and start holding it while walking (I do walk alot living in the city).. But nope. Still cuts in and out. It's a shame really.

Another thing that irks me is that whenever I take out my headset there's a very subtle static-y noise. It gives me a nice wake-up around 2pm when food coma kicks in tho.

Another thing that annoys me is that sometimes when I take the earbuds out and I don't take out the left buds quickly enough, the right earbud will connect by itself thinking that I'm going 1-bud for a phone call so the left bud won't work until I take out the right bud, put it back into the case, and take em back out quickly or at the same time. Annoying.

One thing I do love is the hear-through feature (enabled by double-pressing the right earbud button). I bike around the city often and being able to hear the cars, other bikes, and pedestrians is really helpful and got me out of possible accidents. However I'm never certain about the direction from which the sound is coming from so I essentially go into a Meerkat-like state and check all my periphery to see what's going on. I do think the soundstage (available in more higher-end audio equipment where various audio sources can be ""placed"" in different ""spaces"" to give a spacial effect) is a lacking feature and/or is too subtle to even be called a soundstage. A big miss in my opinion.

Battery life
It's ok. I get a good 5 hours per charge and the case can give another 2 charges so at least the battery life is as advertised. I haven't figured out the battery life indicator on the case yet but wish it was a meter rather than a blinking light but i'll learn to live with it.

Mic Quality
It's great. It has more mics than you'll ever care but it's honestly the one redeeming factor of the day-to-day experience. I'm constantly on a skype call through my phone or laptop and after testing it with skype's mic test & hear-back feature, I can say that the quality is top notch. I've used it with Google Assistant while hitting around 20mph on 8th ave in NYC and even with the wind-noise, cabs, etc. it worked flawlessly.

One annoying thing is that when it's connected to 2 devices and I'm switching from listening to spotify on my phone to getting on a call on skype on my laptop, it doesn't always switch consistently. Sometimes I have to disconnect it from my phone for it to be ""dedicated"" to the laptop but I've seen that happen on other bluetooth headsets so can't knock jabra too hard for that.

Conclusion
Overall, if you're sitting at your cubicle and want to isolate yourself from the world (but maybe listen in on the office gossips using the hear-through feature), it's great. If you're on the move constantly and can't afford to hold your phone close to your ears, it's a hit or miss.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The sound quality, battery life, and comfort are all amazing.  I have used the Jaybird Runs and Airpods and think these destroy those across the board.

The problem I'm having is with sound cutting out, mainly in the left headphone.  At first I thought it was just my house as I have a ton of different wireless devices, but even in the wild I'm running into random pockets where there is some kind of interference that completely destroys the functionality.  The sound keeps clicking and then connectivity will continually go in and out.  I ride public transportation and will often have to go to different cars on the subway to avoid whatever is causing the interference.

I had initially planned to just deal with it, but I've had to swap them out for a back-up wired pair that I keep just in case  too many times at this point.  I had previously been using several generations of the Jaybird Xs and never had this issue, so it's disappointing that it's happening with this (more expensive) pair.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately, these earbuds fall very short:

- didn't pair automatically with my phone/laptop. In fact, it was sometimes difficult/impossible to pair with my laptop.
- didn't fit well in my ear, in spite of having more customizable rubber eartips. Consequently, they fell out of my ears when walking.
- voice instructions are too loud and are not adjustable
- the case itself is difficult to open, and is poor quality. I feel like this was clearly not tested in user groups, as I'm a woman with medium-length nails, and I usually struggle with opening the case because there's no way to grip it without scratching the case.

Things Jabra does better than the Airpods:
- sound quality
- sound blocking (due to the rubber tips)
- having LEDs on both the earbuds and the container. It was nice knowing when the earbuds were fully charged and the case was not, and vice-versa.

Unfortunately, I'll be returning these due to the above reasons.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

TL;DR: The mic didn't work as well as others have stated for me and the fit. Read on for details.

I purchased this locally, to get it that day instead of waiting for shipping, based on all the reviews saying how good they were including the mic. I didn't need headphones but a good headset. But according to all the reviews, I thought these would fulfill that need AND be a good set of headphones too. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I kept having to really raise my voice for anyone to hear me. Almost yelling. I was told that sometimes it sounded only ok and sometimes it was like I was way down a hallway. I do drive a truck and there is background noise from that, but people have mentioned how great they were even in windy/noisy places. Not from my experience.

As far as the fit, the medium didn't feel very good in my ear. I tried the small bud and thought ""Yes! Perfect fit!"". Until my first call... I guess the seal wasn't good enough because it was much quieter than the medium buds. Maybe I could get used to the mediums, but with the mic being an issue I won't find out. This is a personal thing that either will or won't be an issue for others. You just have to try them and find out.

I gave them 3 stars because as headphones they are really good. If they were just a headset, I would've given them 1 star. But that wouldn't be fair considering these are headphones first and foremost.

Also, they are a bit slick when trying to get them out or put them in the box they come with. Which is super nice by the way (not sure why they didn't go with magnets to hold the headphones in it though). From what I understand the active ones are a bit more grippy. I found that you can't really put them in wrong though. When you close the box, the headphones only fit one way in the top section and it should basically position them just right or not close. I saw some reviews mention how hard the box can be to open. And as someone who has a bad habit of biting my nails I can see that being a potential issue. Although I found it pretty easy to open by lightly pushing back on the top part instead of using the little ""lip"" to pop it open with my nails.

Overall, I really liked the headphones, and you can tell they went all out to make a great product with a couple small caveats (slickness and no magnets to hold them in the box). If only the mic was better, I would've kept them and maybe tried some other ear tips if I had to.

Sorry for the long review. Hopefully it helped someone though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can't ever go back to wired ear buds. With comply memory foam tips (not cheap..), the sound quality and sound isolation are awesome, and not much worse than my Bose QC20s. I enjoy having the equalizer options and the automatic pause when one is removed. The battery life is also pretty good. Microphone quality is superb.

But I also slightly hate them, because:

THEY ARE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THEY BRUISED MY EARS. When I wore them with the tips they came with, I experienced actual bruising in my ears after a couple of hours. I tried EVERY position possible and was twisting and turning them for days to try and find the right spot. I have pretty normal size ears for a woman (do women have smaller ears than men?), and the bulk of these ear buds is just enormous and bumps against multiple parts of my ear painfully. Also they fell out very easily.

...BUT I found a solution. With the Comply memory foam tips, if I wear these in the opposite ear as intended, they are tolerably comfortable and I'm able to enjoy the great audio quality and noise isolation I wanted.

Sadly the tips that are comfortable do not fit in the case and I have to remove and store them separately every time, which is a pain in the ass a few times a day. The shorter Truly Wireless tips are as uncomfortable as the default ones, whether I have them in the right ears or opposite ears, but fit into the case.

Oh and the case looks & feels sleek, but the opening and closing action leaves a lot to be desired. It takes a bit of finangling every time to get the ear buds to sit correctly in them no matter which tips are used.

I wish I had gone with a different brand with smaller ear buds or a different shape because the sound quality isn't quite worth the cumbersome methods for making these not extremely painful to wear, and not-being-in-pain is a bit more important than superb sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also if you think you are concerned you may lose one of these pieces, you might as well buy new earbuds because they won’t supply you with a replacement product even if you pay. I had the charging case drop out of my bag at the airport... yeah my fault I get it... but it’s been two months now with now update or response from their team. They are holding all their components for a total product sale and string you along when it comes to replacement parts. The Apple air pods are way easier to come by with replacement parts, sync muchbetter with your iPhone (if you have one), if you have an Apple Watch good luck with these it’s a nightmare, and air pods cost less

Before buying anything like this I usually do extensive research, so scoured the web for competing products in the same price range or higher--read/watched as many reviews as I could (reddit, youtube, amazon, random tech sites, etc.)

Background: Bought these slightly apprehensively as I read about left earbud issues, static, connection, quality, etc. Though kept in mind that when reading reviews, they tend to be skewed as those with issues are more likely to review than those who are happy with their purchase. But compared to the competing products/brands (Bose, Sennheiser, etc.) these seemed like the best choice. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile per se, but am knowledgeable and have a decent ear (play a few instruments, sing, listen to a lot of music). The audio quality on these is great, considering that they're true wireless earbuds. My over the ear daily drivers are Sennheiser 598s and Beyerdynamic 770s.

Length of ownership: Have only used these for about a week so far, so will update if I encounter any issues (some users with issues stated encountering problems a month or two in).

Pros:
- Battery length
- small/convenient case (no magnet..why? D: )
- audio quality (pretty detailed, also feel no need to EQ via app)
- ambient sounds are actually really cool (haven't used them extensively yet but rainy day and storm I would actually use)
- hear-through tech is pretty useful as well (better directional sound than I anticipated after reading reviews)
- look nice
- don't fall out (haven't exercised with them yet but gym is definitely no problem--will try playing a few sports with them in)
- comfortable enough and haven't felt the need to change the tips (silicone is fine though I did buy comply tips as well)
- Blocks out sound very well (this will vary for you depending on your ears--need a good fit and seal)
- Haven't had any issues with calls--seems to block out wind very well

Cons:
- Why no magnets? Would feel super premium and would make taking them out/putting them in so much easier
- Sometimes it'll think you're trying to go mono-bud (right earbud only) mode. Tip: take out the left earbud first and then the right quickly after.
- Bluetooth in random areas: I haven't had any normal skipping issues or audio lag for videos which is great! Though occasionally walking around places like stairwells or other areas with physical/digital interference causes the buds to go in and out. I'd assume this is simply the case for BT buds in general. No problems outside so far

They lose connection and the sound cuts out.  Worst headphones I have every purchased.

UPDATE 1 Aug 2019 - just under 3 months in they have failed completely.  The right earbud will not take a charge.  Jabra has the worst customer service and most complex return policy I have every seen.  Numerous phone calls, days of email exchanges, and they still will not send a return label, just more questions.  I asked Amazon to step in for assistance, but they will not take any responsibility saying it has been more then 30 days.  I do understand this policy, but ultimately Amazon is the one who took the money.  They do have share responsibility.  I have been forced to move on to file a dispute with my credit card company.  This has been a very frustrating experience.  I strongly discourage buying Jabra products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_315?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=315&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First time I put these in while walking I threw one right into a pachysandra garden. Fortunately found it. My daily commute involves crossing a river so I always wait until I’m across. Point is: these are small so if you’re moving from wired buds, handle them carefully.
Tip 2: Insert the left bud first. Inserting right first makes it think you’re going solo.
Tip 3: Occasionally the left bud doesn’t connect when inserting. Simply return both buds to the case then start again. If you look when removing these from the case, you’ll see a green light indicating that they’re powered up. If you don’t see it, put it back and remove again. This isn’t a frequent problem and easily resolved.
Other comments: The app feature of cutting out ambient noise or picking it up on the external mics is excellent. While commuting I allow external sound so I can hear when the conductor makes announcements and traffic when I cross streets, and on a recent flight I tuned out the noise while watching a movie.
The light indicators on the buds and on the case are intuitive. Watch the light when you close the case and if it’s yellow, recharge it soon. Easy.
I’ve tried many buds that don’t stay seated. Using the largest rubber insert, these stay put even if I run with them in.
Sound is very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_309?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=309&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been using these for at least three months. They look good, are light, are easy to pair, are comfortable and have a long battery life.  The app the earbuds is used with is easy to user friendly and provides more capabilities.

I ran approximately 50 miles total and used them in the gym numerous times from 20-60 minutes at a time.  The earbuds have not fallen out and fortunately have not hurt my ears.  The sound quality is impressive.  I even took a couple of phone calls and they sounded good.  I have not been disappointed.

The only thing I kinda don't like is the pass through ability.  If there is very loud noise or very loud music being played, the earbuds will go silent in order to allow the noise to be heard.  I guess that's not a bad thing in case of emergencies and I guess that what the pass through feature is supposed to do.

I have worn them on a run when there was light rain and  did not have any issues.  Since the weather has been cold I haven't drenched them in sweat.  However, on a particular day, I ran 8 miles and did get sweaty, but I did not have any issues with the earbuds.

Since I've had them I have not had to charge my earbuds or the earbud charger case.  I have simply placed them in the charger case and pulled them out when I wanted to use them.

Throughout, I did have a small pairing issue.  But I put the earbuds back in the case and pulled them out and earbuds were fixed.

The earbuds have a feature that I think is pretty cool.  While wearing the earbuds, if you pull an earbud out of your ear, the earbuds will go silent.  I think that's cool.

If you are willing to spend the money they are worth it.  You get what you pay for.  I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything else is a mess. The bluetooth is really spotty when paired to my cellphone (Pixel 3 XL). To make it worse, when you're around a fair number of people also using bluetooth headphones (say, in a moderately busy gym), the audio crackles and cuts out.

The charging case is also pretty bad. It feels downright cheap when you handle it; every time I open the case, I fear the cover will snap right off. But that's nothing compared to the charging itself. The indicator light on the case is useless. It's green until the whole thing is dead. You never get a good indication that you should charge it. And, most infuriatingly, if you put the earbuds into the case while the battery is dead, the case drains the battery of your earbuds. If the case is out of batteries, it's literally better to manually power off the earbuds and leave them loose in your pocket or bag.

Finally, I just have to talk about the android app. Or, I should say more accurately, the apps. Any time your earbuds are paired, there are three different non-dismiss-able tray icons. One lets you know what ""mode"" your earbuds are in, one gives you a tray icon to find your earbuds if you misplace them (note: this tray icon appears _when the earbuds are paired to your phone_), and third tray icon that seems to serve literally no purpose. The only features these apps offer are an equalizer and the option to choose your voice assistant (alexa vs google).

These are truly a disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_318?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=318&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is mediocre. You can improve the sound by putting a bud on that fully seals your ear canal, but then they become very painful to wear. That being said, their controls are fairly good and they are ascetically pleasing when you look in the mirror! Their main competition (IMO) is Bose's fully wireless Soundsports. And, honestly, Jabra does not compare. Jabra's controls are slightly easier to use (you have to press 'hard' on Bose's) and the Jabra's look better in your ear.

I would have preferred to buy these from Amazon, but they weren't in stock.  They paired to my iPhone 6S easily and also my Apple watch.  Next was a quick firmware upgrade that only took about 5 minutes.  The firmware updates while the earbuds are in their case.  The medium ear gels seemed to fit me the best.  While it took a little while to get used to waring these they were pretty comfortable.  The feel solid and I don't believe I'll need to worry about them falling out at all.  I've tried a couple of calls and the people I spoke with said the call quality was great.  I thought the sound they produce was good and did take advantage of the app to adjust the EQ to my liking.  The ""hear through"" function basically uses the microphones to electronically push the outside sound into your ears.  I plan to use these for running and cycling and think the pass through will work just fine.  If the fit during my exercising stays solid (I think it will), I may even try these on my motorcycle.  It would be great to hear music and my GPS while I'm cruising.  I'll update this review once I put some hours on these.

Update 5/29/18:

Ok, so now I've used these on a run, a bicycle ride and on my motorcycle.  They have worked really well.

During my run they were comfortable and secure.  Being able to turn the hear through feature on or off while running using the button on the headset is very useful. While listening to music, it can be difficult to tell if the hear through feature is on or off.  I recommend Jabra add a tone or message to confirm if the hear through is on or off.

On my bicycle ride, the ear pieces stayed put and never shifted.  I put ""hear through"" on and it worked well.  There was some wind noise which I expected, but  I didn't mind as I was also able to hear cars and outside noise.  I did try turning hear through off while riding on a trail and the wind noise stopped instantly.  These worked better than I would have thought.  I did end up leaving the hear through on most of the ride as I felt safer and was able to speak with people I passed.

Next was a ride on my Harley. With Vance & Hines pipes my bike is a little loud. I turned the ""hear through"" off and the volume up a little and these worked great.  I wear a half helmet and these fit well under the side straps.  I even made a call while at a traffic light and riding at slow speed. Over 50 mph I turned the volume up a little to find a good balance between hearing music and my exhaust.  I also tested these using my GPS.  Actually hearing ""turn by turn"" directions while riding was a big plus for me.

Over all, I'm very pleased with these.  While I've only had these for a short while, they do everything I need them to and more.
Good work Jabra!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are absolutely 'ok' ear buds, but there are better alternatives","I returned this after 3 weeks of use.  Overall: mediocre sound, not comfortable, finicky to connect and painful to control.
Details:
* Sound was terrible until I changed the ear cup size, then it became ok.  Still tinny.
* The medium cup was too small and the large too big - I felt them in my ears continually.  I never had this problem with my old JLab earbuds
* Changing volume or controlling anything required pressing the ear unit and it was painful
* If I was not super careful removing them from my ears, I'd lose an ear cup sometimes requiring tweezers to get them out
* Refused to pair with my older MacBook.  Several times had to 'forget' and reconnect with various devices, a major pain switching between phone, (newer) computer and exercise equipment.
* Often refused to connect and had to put them back in the case or power cycle them
* Not very good a blocking outside sounds
* The 'hear through' feature meant to allow in outside sound didn't really do much other than add a faint 'hiss' (You can already hear conversations, it's not needed.)
Overall an average experience. If these were all that existed in the world, I""d probably use them as better than nothing, but there are better choices.

For alternatives, AirPods would be much better experience though lacking in any noise isolation.
I'm planning to try the new Power Beats next.  More expensive but presumably they will deliver where Jabra falls short.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros :
1- Great sound quality (very heavy bass, helps a lot in the gym).
2- Good fit for the Gym.
3- Bluetooth Multipoint (its a con too.)
4- battery lasts long.
5- Microphones are no joke, hands down you won't regret making phone calls using these buds.
6- No Latency whatsoever.
Cons :
1- Case is bulky, won't fit in pocket, feels cheap, not magnetized, and very hard to open the first couple of times.
2- No USB-C.
3- No Wireless Charging.
4- Bluetooth Multipoint can only pair two devices at a time, and there is noway to turn it off (why would you want to turn it off ? because if you're moving around the house and getting out of range from the second device, the earbuds will keep connecting and disconnecting from such device and keep disrupting your activity, trust me I specifically chose these earbuds because they had Multipoint, but now I'm regretting that I was too focused on that part).
5- only the Right earbud connects to the device.
6- They became defective after 5 months of usage, and Jabra's Tech Support was very frustrating to deal with, they took over two weeks to complete my return, and kept asking silly questions.
I would still buy these again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality is good with an equalizer feature that you can customize your sound settings with.
Hear through feature enables you to hear outside noise (when turned on) so you don't have to pull the earbuds out for quick conversations.

Only thing that would've made these headphones great is if you could use the left earbud independently of the master right earbud. The left earbud cannot be used unless the right earbud is pointing directly at left earbud (eliminating the ability to share earbuds with another; and/or, use only the left earbud as the right one charges).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_322?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=322&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm good with keeping them working just the way they have been. Please continue reading!

I've owned these for 5 months, so I've had a chance to really use them in all situations - listening to music while working out, running, while riding in the car or on a plane, or at my desk as well. I've also used it to take calls. I am really impressed. I love the low profile as they don't look outrageous when I'm wearing them (I got the copper black color, like it better than any other released colors). Water resistance was what really steered me towards these when I was comparing against others (I was about to purchase the Sennheiser Momentum bluetooth earbuds, but they are not rated as highly against dust ingress and water resistance; for those interested, the Jabra Elite Actives are rated as IP56 while the Sennheiser Momentums are rated at IPX4). They don't fall out, they connect almost instantly, they do not drop connection to my phone or each other, and the controls are easy (forward/back, volume up/down, answer call/hang up). My music sounds good; note that you will not get bass like you do for over ear headphones. I was aware of that during my research for bluetooth earbuds, you should be too. When I have the volume up (as much as is considered safe), I am not hearing too much outside noise, so noise cancelling is good enough for me (used them on my business flights). Battery length is pretty good, and the extra charge you get from the case is good too (a 20 min charge from empty will give you about an hour's worth of operation).

As for the HearThrough option, while I can notice it a little bit, I don't really see it as anything special. However, that was not a deal breaker for me. You need to decide whether that's something really important.

A tip I saw on a different review that I followed myself after reading is when you are putting them into the charging case, ensure that you line them up on the cap and then close. Works every time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I offer the following:

Pros:
1.  Audio quality is very good.  While the set I have does not include noise cancelling technology, the noise isolation feature works very well, resulting in close to the same results as the Bose wireless earbuds I have for a much lower price.
2.  For my ears, they fit very well, and are comfortable.  Your experience may differ.
3.  Sturdiness - They hold up well when you are sweating.  I've not seen any moisture-related issues, and I have given the set plenty of time to prove itself in that regard.
4.  Battery life - Considering the size of these earbuds, the battery life is excellent.  I routinely get two to three hours of full-time listening without need to charge.  When I am on long duration conference calls, the battery life is shorter, but not significantly so.  Pop them in the case for a half hour and you get another 3 hours or so of full time listening.  When the use is intermittent, I get all day use without recharge.
5. Bluetooth range - the range is very good, much better than the Bose set I mentioned earlier.  I go out of the room my phone is in (20-25') without loss of signal.

Cons:
1.  I have recently noticed a tendency for the left ear bud to come unpaired with the right.  The right earbud is the one that communicates with your phone, and the left simply receives its signal from the right.  I will be rocking along enjoying some music when the left ear bud will come unpaired.  I have to put them in the case, turn off my Bluetooth on my phone, and then take the right one and start it to pairing.  Then I have to press both sides of the control buttons on the left earbud for a slow count of five to get it to pair with the right.  This started showing up after a recent firmware update (the firmware updates automatically to the buds from the app), so the problem may be software rather than hardware-related.

Considering the star rating I've given the product, this one con is a deal-killer for me.  I don't know the cause of it, nor am I interested in finding out why.  I just want them to work reliably.  They don't, so my message to the prospective buyer is: buyer beware.  I expect a minimum of two years of trouble-free service from electronics of this nature.  This one doesn't pass that test.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just received it and did the firmware update and then tried to have a voice call while having a brief walk around the block. The person on the other side was constantly complaining because of the outrageously loud sounds coming in from the cars (although they aren't that loud but only magnified) and the smallest car honk and bike passing by.
I wanted to check for myself so I started the voice recorder on my phone and was standing around 50 feet away from the main road. I kept talking for around a minute and cars were passing by on the road. After I stopped to listen, my voice was barely heard while I could hear the sounds of every car very loudly. I could even hear a slightly loud pick up truck which i saw around 70 feet away. Its sound was annoyingly high in my ear knowing that the volume was on half.

These earbuds are falsely advertising great call quality, this is THE worst experience i have had through all the earbuds, earphones, headphones or even phones itself. I emailed jabra about this and will be updating this review with the result whether it was positive or negative.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_398?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=398&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Used it regularly for under two weeks before the left earbud died while it was in the charging case. Tried to get it to work but it won't even charge anymore. The volume is pretty loud since you can adjust the volume from the earbud and your phone independently, others will only adjust your phone's volume. However, it lacks deep sound while listening to music, even with the equalizer from the Jabra app. The hearthru option is a nice idea but all the noise sounds much further than it is so it's a challeng making out words. Also all noise it picks up sounds as if it's at equal distance. Someone speaking to me 5 ft away is the same volume as someone speaking 30 ft away. As far as volume other hear while on calls, the mic seems to be too sensitive. Doing normal things around the room would hurt the ears of the person I'm on the phone with (closing the door, footsteps, throwing garbage in the trash.)

Things I like:
secure fit if inserted as in the instructions.
Very loud potential for volume
Good battery life
Charging case
Jabra app helps locate earbuds

Things I dislike:
Lack of deep sound
Poor quality mic
Hearthrough option needs improvements
Buttons require too much pressure to register command
It's a gamble if your earbud will die early
Can only use right earbud independently
Range feels too short. Starts cutting out around 20 ft.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Made a mistake replacing my Bose Soundsport with these. Charge very slowly, if the buds and the case is dead, they don't charge in the case while the case is charging, leaving you with at least an hour of charging time. Soundsport you can plug in for about 15 minutes and get at least an hour out of. I never found a comfortable fit, they either plug your ears so you get a very closed sound, or they're about to fall out. If you shower or clean your ears before wearing them, it is near impossible to get them to stay in. Additionally, the noise cancelling aspect is very dangerous in sports headphones. You cannot hear cars or atmospheric noises until they are right next to you. There are buttons on the buds that allow you to advance the song, adjust the volume, or turn the buds on. In order to push these buttons you have to leverage the bud against your war. Turning the music up comes at the expense of jamming then into your ear. Also, they constantly autoplay music if they're in your pocket and not in the case, running down the battery of both your phone and the headphones. The charge amount given fresh off of the charger is never accurate, it will say ""50%"" and then 10 minutes later they'll be at 10%. Sound quality is good, that is if you can actually get the headphones to stay in your ear or stay charged. The worst purchase I've made in recent memory. Maybe wait until an updated model is released.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While I can't say much for the control app as it never quite works, the buttons have all the functionality you need.  I'm am constantly concerned with the quality of the microphones I am using as I pretty much talk on the phone all day for work and I have received nothing but positive feedback for sound quality.

I also use these for listening to music on my mountain bike rides.  While they don't have a nice full response for music, they sound fine for listening while riding and the Hear Through function lets the ambient noise in if you want to hear other the surroundings - for me other riders/hikers/horses.

The battery life is great if you keep the little charge case charged and bring it with you.  They really do give you around 5 hours talk time and they charge quite fast in the case.  This is still the case after 6 months.

Although they have never fallen out of my ears, I have accidentally dropped them in the dirt a dozen times without any damage.  They have also been through 2 FULL WASHING MACHINE CYCLES!  Yes, I accidentally left them in my bike jersey and washed them... twice.  They still sound the same... including the microphone.  If that doesn't say something about durability, I don't know what does.

I love the functionality for calls.  My phone rings.  I put the earbuds in and it answers the call immediately so I don't miss the call.  I also love how easy it is to adjust the volume.  Do not expect amazing sound quality.  These earbuds have 2 purposes - music while exercising and phone calls - and they are great for those 2 things.  I was hesitant because of the price but after 6 months, I am completely satisfied.  If I want sound quality for music or even movies, I'll use my over the ear headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am not alone!","I wish I could recommend these headphones, but I can't.  BEWARE left earbud no-sound issues.  Got them brand new from Amazon, opened and set them up as per Jabra instructions (the included instructions in box are horrible, make sure to go to Jabra.com to get the full manual so you can see what the lights mean and buttons as it's not that user friendly).  Right earbud works fine but no matter what I did the left one will not play any sound.  I contacted Jabra support and none of their super obvious ""solutions"" worked.  Factory reset (I did this like 4 times already, no change), update firmware (again, no change), fill out warranty and wait to get replacements (hell no!).  I looked online and this is far from a unique problem.  There are posts all over the web with the same issue.  Even one YouTube video from some random person titled ""left earbud no sound"" with over 11,000(!!) views.  That is not an isolated problem and Jabra should be recalling and doing better QA.  So I am returning to Amazon and looking for a more reliable brand.  It's too bad because from what I heard through the right earbud, the sound was very solid.  I tried Cambridge Audio's true wireless and they just did not sound good and apparently they have a terrible mic for taking calls.

Other feedback about the buds in general:
1. The fit is pretty decent and I have small ears which often makes it tough.
2. The buttons are super annoying and put quite a bit of pressure on your inner ear to press them to increase volume, pause etc.  Not sure how to fix that given the buds are the only place to put buttons.
3.  Pairing is kind of a clunky process and all the different flashing LED colors on each bud are only obvious after you read the full user manual which is not part of the package but online.
4.  Charging case is a really nice compact size, but super tough to open.  Feels like I'm going to break it every time I open it.

Again, I was ready to love these earbuds, but not having both buds play sound is kind of a big problem.  Do your research and know that you might get ones that work perfectly and you'll love them. Or you'll be unlucky like me and seemingly thousands of other people and have this issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only issue I have is with one of my ears. That your phone does start to hurt the inside of my ear after an hour or so.

Sound quality is excellent, the connectivity is nearly seamless, and the app is perfect.

I believe a lot of the issues pointed out by previous reviews (left ear bud not working, low volume) are fixed by the sound+ app! They fit/seal fine in my ears. Worth every penny!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My initial impression of sound quality was that it was sub-par compared to the jaybird x3 headphones I had been using.  I need large tips, the ""vacuum"" the seal created in my eardrums was annoying, and after a short amount of time became very uncomfortable in my ears.  I did not get the noise isolation and deep bass that I was used to getting with the jaybird foam tips and I felt that I was constantly adjusting them trying to get a better sound out of them.  Played around with EQ settings and the sound didn't get any better. I tried this setup for a couple days and could not get used to it.
I had some extra pairs of comply T-500 isolation tips laying around from a previous set of jaybirds.  At first, they fell right off the jabras.  Using a razor, I carefully cut the clear silicone part off the original jabra small tips, leaving only the red inner sleeve, and put the red sleeve back on the jabras. Then put the Comply tips on over the red sleeve.  Guess what, now my Comply tips fit the Jabras perfectly. WOW.  What a difference!  After tweaking the bass up using the EQ in the Jabra app, the sound was way better.
The earbuds fit snugly in the case with the Comply tips but they do fit.  Occasionally one tip gets stuck in the case when I take the buds out but it can be easily pried out.  Minor issue considering these tips weren't designed for these earbuds.
The jabras are perfect for lifting weights and have made me forget how annoying corded headphones can be!  With the X3's, I've pulled an earphone out of my ear many times and would need to move the cord from back to front so as not to get caught in between a barbell and my neck or catch on the bench.
I have had them in my ears all day and they're still comfortable now. Often I wear them all day both at they gym and making calls from my home office.  Battery getting low?  15 minutes in the case and they're good for another conference call.
Noise isolation is good but not great.  Significantly better call quality than the X3's.  Now I can talk on the phone with the windows down in my 3/4 ton diesel and my wife says she cant even tell I'm driving.  On the X3's, call quality was atrocious with background noise present so its definitely better there.  But it still seems to pick up some outside noise, particularly higher pitched noises, so I wouldn't put the noise isolation up against a trucker's headset like the blueparrot series (which i have also used in the past)  In the office they work fine, although sometimes I need to adjust them to make sure the mics are pointing in the right direction.
Bottom Line, get the right tips and you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They fit securely, more so than any wired or semi-wireless earbuds I've owned ( a bunch, from Shure to Beats to Bose).

I have been attempting to contact jabra’s customer service for weeks now (multiple emails and calls) with zero response. I did enjoy the headphones prior to the case stopping working (good sound, good noise cancellation, and only ever had them fall out with heavy sweating), but the price is way too high to pay for just 6 months of use plus being unable to get ahold of customer service.

However for heavy sweat workouts these jabra elite active 65t lasted two months. The two stars are because you can’t advertise sweatproof and still fail like cheaper headsets.  Over time sweat will eventually have a corrosive impact on the hardware.

Of note I run marathons and primary use is for running and weights.  I do sweat a significant amount compared to my fellow runners.  I use occasionally for streaming movies when traveling.

I have used Jabra, Jaybird, JBL, Sanso and others but I won’t compare them.

Negative:
1.  After two months the right headset volume output decreased suddenly.  While I was running on treadmill there was a pop noise and output went to half the volume.  This has happened on cheaper headsets and always on right side which is usually the master side.

2.  The hear through feature is designed to hear sounds while working out for safety, etc...  I used it during runs and found you could hear traffic but sound quality is significantly impaired.  You are better off getting bone conduction headphones.

3.  Volume controls harder to use when running but fine for low impact activities.

4.  Lasts longer than 4 hours so it is good for long runs.  The charging case works quickly and easily but caution as it can fall out of case because not magnetized.

Positive:
1.  Very good sound quality if not working out or running.  Quality decreases with hear through feature.
2.  Initial fit was uncomfortable but ear canals adjusted so very comfortable.  It did not fall out during long runs.
3.  Earbuds may fall out of charging case as it is not magnetized.

Overall this review is meant for people that sweat profusely.  This product is advertised specifically for active use.  After trying expensive and cheap headsets they all have a corrosive impact over time.  If you can deal with the headset warranty periodically then you will be fine.  It has good sound but you are probably better of getting cheaper headsets and replacing every six months with updated technology.  The sound quality difference is more noticeable with less strenuous activities.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm glad they work for them, but they sure don't work for me--I am definitely having buyer's remorse. The ONLY thing I like about these is the sound quality of calls. People can hear me fine and I can hear them.

Cons:
-the buds have to ""screw"" into my ear canals for a snug fit--I've tried both the small and medium plug coverings and they are both uncomfortable bordering on slightly painful.
-even after inserted they are prone to falling back out. I have to re-do the insertion several times.
-the aggressive insertion means I am pressing the buttons on the outside of the headphone.
-they only hold a charge for 5 hours, which means if you are on calls all day you'd better have a backup pair.
-the charging case is almost impossible to open. Honestly it's like adding insult to injury that I have to wrestle to get these uncomfortable headphones out of their damn charging case.

The idea of wearing these for a workout makes me laugh. I'm ordering a different pair right now for that purpose. If you've ever been told you have narrow ear canals these are not the wireless headphones you're looking for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I run in them, work out in them and listen at the office. The sound quality is good. I prefer more bass. But I am VERY satisfied with these.

Update 7/10/19
Almost a year since I bought these. I actually have two sets. I use one at work and one to run. Went through an issue where the sound was off balance. The left ear was quieter than the right. One pair barely has sound now and has a high pitch sound to them. I did the hardware update. Seemed to work fine for one pair. But the second pair would never update. I tried and tried with support and they always came back with something for me to try. It’s been 4 months and I wasted $380 on these two sets. These are crap and not worth the money. They start off great. They don’t last and support is awful! Don’t waste your money on Jabra.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros: Better sound quality than AirPod, it maybe caused by the tighter fit. Active noise cancellation. Personally like the low-key style. Not noticeable at work place.

Cons: quality is not good. Although it is like new condition and passed amazon inspection. Left ear bud volume became significantly lower than right ear bud after 3-month moderately use. Searched online, it is known issue. Jabara does not cover the earbuds from amazon market place because it is used no matter if it is still under 1-year from first usage.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought them because of their many features like the “hear through” capability because I run on roads and ride motorcycles with them and like to hear my surroundings. But unfortunately I dismissed the reviews that stated they had issues with the left earbud dropping out because there didn’t seem to be a lot of them. Alas I had mine for 4 months and they worked great, then I started getting random dead moments and clicking noises in the left ear bud. Jabra has very good customer service and agreed to replace mine under warranty (maybe good customer service? Maybe it’s because they’ve been seeing this issue? Idk). The reason I put sound quality at a 3 star is because my first pair didn’t seam to have the volume or bass I was expecting (wrote it off because they were water proof)and after I received my second pair the issue was confirmed because my second pair had much better volume and bass. But I was sorely disappointed when not even 2 days after recieving the replacement they started doing the same thing my first pair did. Called jabra and their sending me a third pair (hopefully this helps?). I suspect it might be something screwy with the headphones proximity system but I cannot confirm it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For the above $150 price range these earbuds look good but disappoint.
Bass range is inferior.  At times there can be subtle clicks in the audio.  Ear canal comfort is a bit below comfortable.
The design of the storage case is not that great.  The case is rounded which makes it easy to slip out of ones hands.  The flip top lid is a challenge to open every time, requiring two focused hands to peel that open.  I tried several methods to open, it is always a task to do.  I'm not sure why designers cannot make that happen well.  Pushing the earbuds into the case holder bays is also a focused task.  If you open the case the wrong way one or both of the earbuds can flip out onto the floor with a nice cracking sound.
Ran into issues where in a moderately industrial environment the person called gets all the background noise and also has a hard time understanding what is said because of cut off and ambient sound.  Using other brand earbuds or wired buds did not encounter this in same environment.
I can say, Sony puts out a better earbud for sound quality and Bose earbuds, while bigger, those do meet the challenges of being earbuds that work well for handling and delivery top end sound.  For the $150 range and up, better off going with those brands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_308?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=308&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In order for the ear buds to recharge properly, the case must be upright; however, there’s no way to sit the case upright unless it’s wedged between something; the bottom of the charging case isn’t flat and the earbuds don’t remain connected for charging if the case is on it’s side.

But they are at this point completely unreliable.  The left earbud only turns on half the time, and you have to keep re-closing and opening the case over and over until it lights up and turns on.  There is no manual way that I'm aware of to turn the left earpiece on, which is a bad decision when it doesn't reliably turn on when it's supposed to.  Also, they will sometimes turn on while still in the case which gets extremely annoying when I'm in the car listening via a headphone jack and the sound suddenly switches to my earbuds in my backpack.  Additionally when they turn on while I'm not using them, they run the battery down and start chirping and giving weird feedback, which is normally how I find out they've been sitting there turned on.

When they work correctly, the sound is good and they are mostly comfortable.  The battery life is very good.  For this price though, they're far too unreliable and I wish I hadn't purchased them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have used these earbuds for about 12 hours daily for 2 weeks and have come up with a different opinion.
They are worth every penny and they out class my apple Airpods by far.
If you do not own a defective unit, you have paid for a very good quality piece of equipment.
I will recommend the Jabra Elite 65t any day to anyone looking for a quality product.
My reasons are listed as follows.

Pros:
1. They easily connect to two phones at the same time
2. Bluetooth 5.0, meaning better and clearer connectivity and better range
3. Phone app has various settings, including a high quality equaliser, to suit your taste of music and sound.
4. One charge gives me about 6hrs on the right earpiece. Well tested and proven.
5. Charging case provides an extra 10 hrs of charge.
6. Clear and crisp sound quality for voice, though not too loud.
7.Volume control plus track fwd on left earpeace
8. Caller identifier, plus can receive or ignore calls with the Voice prompt without reaching for your phone by saying ""Answer or Ignore"". My phones can remain permanently on silent mode.
9. Noise cancelling can completely seal out outside sound or noice. Perfect for airplane travel.
10. Good quality microphones, 2 per earpiece. I can speak quietly and the receiver can hear me clearly. Well tested and proven.
11. Music stops when you remove an earpiece, just like the Airpods
12. Very good connectivity between the two earpieces. No delay in both connections like the Apple AirPods.
13. When using both earpieces, the sound quality outclasses the sound on the AirPods due to the reduction in outside noise.
14. Never falls off your ear ,unlike the Apple Airpods. This is due to the earpiece fit design. You can jog and  workout comfortably with them on.
15. Best of all, They look GOOD !!!

Cons
1.You can only use the right side as a single earpiece . Unlike the AirPods where you can use either. If you remove the right earpiece the left goes off. But you can still use the right side alone and still get good quality sound. I believe this is because the right earpiece is designed to be the Master.
2. Because of the high quality of the equaliser, you have to set the frequencies right, inorder to get very high quality sound for the music.

The Pros far outweighs the Cons.
I own the Jabra Elite 65t, a pair of Apple AirPods and the Bose QC30 Noise cancelling earphones.
Even though the Bose packs more punch on Bass frequencies, the Jabra is a lot more functional and an overall winner of the three.
Good job Jabra.!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_404?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=404&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The jabra 65t behave exactly like my 20$ mpow earphones I use for the gym. They make it sound like you are standing in the walkway of a stadium. The mic will pick up the music in Starbucks instead of your voice. If you want to experience what your caller hears turn on the pass through and all the ambient noise will be in your ear too. The fit is great. For music the sound is good and the noise canceling functions. I bought these specifically for conference calls and because jabra is supposed to be known for its mic technology.

This Summer, as temps work towards 100 degrees plus, these earbuds have been my constant companion.  Whether blocking noise for work, listening to a podcast while cooking dinner (although the noise cancelling makes hearing the sizzle of my pans difficult), or turning over my garden, these earbuds are the best!

Even if they both worked I would have to damage my ear drums to be able to hear my music/podcast/audiobook. They are not incredibly comfortable either and will just pop out of my ear regardless of the size of ear cap I tried. These more match the quality of a bad knock off product than something over $150.

My main problem is that I am having a very difficult time trying to consistently get these to stay in my ears.  I like to go running with these and, while they haven't completely fallen out yet, there have been a few times where they've come very close.  I reach up to check on them because the sound gets a little noisy and they're barely still in.  Maybe I'll get used to this and will provide an update.

My earbuds failed to work properly (right earbud volume was drastically lower than left earbud) within 2 months of purchase with normal use at the gym. After 2.5 months of back and forth with customer service (usually with a week between emails from customer service) - including filing a formal warranty claim - Jabra's customer service never sent me a replacement device. They also stopped responding to my emails entirely once I submitted the warranty claim. This includes me sending them two warnings that I would leave a negative comment on Amazon and file a claim with the consumer protection agency.

These earbuds worked for only 2 months and then Jabra's customer led me on for months before simply not responding. They never sent a replacement device either.

I have been using them for about a week at work, leaving them in for long stretches and not once have I ever felt that they might fall out and they are surprisingly comfortable even using the standard silicone buds. The design is sleek and user friendly. Once they are connected to your phone the first time you are good to go, never needing to go through the hastle of pairing them again, at least with my Note 9 that's been the case. I haven't experienced any of the connectivity issues mentioned in other reviews (perhaps a firmware update has addressed this issue since those reviews were written.)

The only complaint that I have is that the sound quality is a bit lacking for the price range. I wouldn't expect these to compare to a pair of Sennheiser or Bose over ear headphones on terms of quality but at $170 I would expect them to at least be comparable to my Bose wired earbuds which only ran about $120.

If sound quality is the end all be all for you in a pair of headphones/earbuds I would reccomend sticking with something a but more substantial. Wireless earbuds just haven't gotten there yet, but if you are looking for something incredibly comfortable and very convenient then I would recommend these over any other product I have tried or owned including apple air pods which don't even compare to these even in terms of sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- They fit me perfectly, and don't fall out, even when running.
- I think they look pretty good - not too bulky like others I've seen.

- The case makes it super easy to charge the buds.
- I can hardly hear my environment even when they are on low volume.
- In the app, there is a HearThrough feature that let's you hear your environment a bit more. Works good enough.

The app also let's you adjust EQ, which is cool.

I’ve tried all the different sizes of ear adapters and read several descriptions of how to get a good fit and none provide a good fit that will stay in my ear.  I’m not an audiophile but the sound quality is quite good and much better than my previous Bluetooth earphones and better than the AirPods.  The equalizer in the app does help create a better sound profile.

They have some noise isolation but they are definitely not noise canceling headphones.  The noise isolation is largely dependent on how tightly they are in the ear canal which also has a negative impact on comfort.  Noise isolation is pretty good if they are deep in the ear but that makes them quite uncomfortable.  I’m not sure but the HearThrough option in the app seems to amplify/distort outside noise rather than remove it like active noise isolation does.  When turned on, it made the sound from lawn equipment sound really weird.  Either way, traffic noise, car horns, lawn and construction equipment can be heard quite well with or without HearThrough enabled.  This is quite different than the Bose noise canceling over the ear headphones that nearly completely block out computer fans and a distant car alarm (which was going off as I wrote this).

It is kind of nice to have the additional functionality associated with multiple buttons vs the Apple AirPods.  Still, it can be difficult to find just the right spot to change the volume or skip tracks.  Mostly it is easier to just pick up the phone than it is to remember which ear phone (right or left) is for volume and whether to tap or hold for the function you want.  Also, using the buttons can tend to push the earphone deeper into your ear which is not what you want to do.  Still, in some circumstances, this works well if you use it enough to remember which button and to hold it when pressing.

Due to the fact that the earphone’s noise isolation and sound quality are dependent on being buried deep within your ear, they are not nearly as comfortable to wear as the Apple AirPods.  I’ve worn them for a couple of hours so it isn’t bad but it is definitely not comfortable.  It would be really nice if they came with the extra clips to fit in the ear like the Jabra Elite Sport, but they are not worth the $50 difference in price.

The recharging case is a nice feature which allow you to recharge even if not tethered to power.  Also, storing the headphones in the case pretty much ensures that they are charged each time you use them (if properly inserted in the case).  The case can be difficult to open (I still struggle with this) and seating the headphone precisely in the case is important as one time I pulled the headphones out of the case and they were nearly dead because they didn’t recharge.  This is different than the AirPods that just drop into place in the case with no worry about making sure they are seated correctly on the connectors.  It is also really nice that they connect to the phone when you pull them out of the case so that by the time they are in your ears, you are connected rather than having to push a button and wait for the Bluetooth connection like my previous earphones.

One nice feature that I discovered is that when you get a call, you can simply say “answer” and it will take the call rather than trying to find the button to answer.

You can use these in the shower or in the rain (they are splash proof) but they tend to cut in/out.  My guess is that they are pausing and starting because they think you have removed them and reinserted them as the water splashes on your head.  Still, it was nice to see that the “rain” didn’t cause a real problem.

They almost always stay put in the ear (if properly embedded in the ear) when sitting at the computer or lying down but walking or bending over tend to cause them to get loose and running or other more active workouts cause them to fall out pretty regularly.  They also tend to fall out when you roll over if worn in the bed.  The worst is when you step off a curb and they fall out and bounce down the street.  Luckily this caused no damage and I don’t even see a scratch after this happened twice.  Now I’ve learned to hold my hand to my ear when stepping off the curb but I shouldn’t have to do that.

Overall, I’ve found that I like them much better than my previous set of $20 wire-between-the-headset Bluetooth earphones (but 6X the cost) but falling out of my ears may be a deal breaker.  It is still a tossup between the AirPods and the Jabra.  Jabra has better sound quality but the AirPods are more comfortable and fit easier into the case.  Between the Bose Quiet Comfort and Jabra, there is no comparison in sound quality, comfort and noise cancellation (Bose is in a completely different class) but these are much more convenient and tend to get much more use than the Bose for general use and just walking around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The big big but is that the mic does not work well if you have a deeper voice. At least 3 other people tried these with me, they all say that they could not hear me well at all calling with these. The other 3 people do not have deep tone and they sounded fine when they called with them. So the best guess is voice tone is an issue. BTW I have tried a few other True wireless buds, and most do not work well if you have a deeper voice tone. Only a guess, but maybe it's the noise canceling is the issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first one died within a month. No problem, they sent out a replacement under warranty. When I lost the “new” left one a few months later, I purchased another left through Amazon. It came quickly but was very staticky and continually dropped in and out of sync with the right ear bud. Called customer service. the same day I received. Sat on hold for an hour. Rather than replace, I was told by Jabra customer service that I had to send both my latest defective left and my working right ear buds back and they would send a new pair. I use these for work and resisted since the right was working fine but was told they would cross ship as soon as the package was logged by UPS and should have them by within 4 days. Following up over a week later, and sitting on hold for another hour, I was told the previous customer service rep lied. They will not cross ship. The package has been received but not processed so it will probably be another week and a half before I get the replacements. Fingers-crossed that the left works....This is why I buy Apple products.

After my last pair finally kicked the bucket, I decided it was time to upgrade. These headphones are definitely worth the upgrade! The batteries last several hours and the charging case let’s me go about a week between charging. The noise cancellation works well, although the hear-through (or whatever they’re calling it) tech still needs a little work. It works great sometimes, not so much other times. When bike riding, the microphones it uses pick up quite a bit of wind noise - to be expected - with running it isn’t so noticeable except on really windy days. The sound quality is excellent even at the higher volumes with good bass for such small headphones. You never realize how much your headphone wires get in your way until you get rid of them... big frustration saver during intense workouts.

My walks to and from school became really great with NPR podcasts through the unfriendly U of Montana campus. Sound was ok relative to my Noble wired earbuds, and good compared to Koss Porta on the ears headphones. Bluetooth connectivity walking through the campus was erratic and frustrating. Nothing I did, a 2019 software update and fiddling with my iPhone XS Max would hasten a 100-200 yard walk with no sound. I lost my right earbud when it fell out just as I bent over a flushing toilet. My hand dove without hesitation into the water to no avail. I paid for another right earbud immediately without reservations. I expected to receive a replacement in 1 - 2 weeks maybe closer to 20 days after 3/24/2019 because it’s Missoula , MT. I started to write to them around 4/20/2019. After 4 communications including a pleasant and  quick connection to lady she assured me that I would be notified as soon as a right earbud shipped from China. I wrote 2 more times around 4/24/19 and the 4th email came around 4/26/2019. It said that there is essentially no time even after a month when a right earbud will be produced and shipped to me for the $49.99 I paid. That seems like a long delay. Well I’m starting to look elsewhere including buying another set of the same buds. The Bluetooth connectivity is far from infallible and the right earbud has always been unpredictably stuck in my outer  canal. I’d rather buy a newer better different product at this point but this appears to be the state of the art.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_274?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=274&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The jabras are lovely. I love all the features with the calls and the background noise modulators. Although they don’t sound quite as good as the Bose. These are a keeper. The case is garbage though. My Bose snap into place to charge and the just set in the case. If you want an AirBuds alternative these are it. Sound good, call quality is good. I asked my callers if they could hear me in noisy situations and they reported I sounded up front and clear. I recommend these for all around use.

Jabra has no helpful customer support","I purchased the Jabra Elite Active 65t as a replacement for my AirPods after one broke.  I intended to use these for road biking as well.  I’ll cut to the chase and say this was the single worse electronics purchase I have ever made. Everything about these screams cheap, including the wailing feedback these puppies make in your pocket if you have the ambient mic on.

I took these for one test bike ride and one fell out twice.  In 1.5 years of AirPodsni has one drop.  So I did some Internet research and tried again, screwing them into my ears.  This time no drops.  Next ride, after the same routine of twisting them into my ear one fell out on a busy road. It was not retrievable.

Best buy won’t take thenm back, jabra will only give me a 20% off coupon which I’ll never use.  Even when I had two if these the plastic case was flimsy and cheap feeling. Sound is on par or worse than airpods. Ambient mic is a stupid gimic.  They suck at noise blocking to begin with and the headphones squeal in mice in your pocket if you dot turn off that stupid feature.  Battery was horrible as well.

If you want to waste $185 I suggest finding something more fun than this junk.

I want to begin by saying that I previously purchased and extensively tested Bragi, Jaybird, and Samsung earbuds. Bragi has the hearthrough function, but terrible sound. Samsung and Jaybird have better sound but no hearthrough, voice quality and connectivity issues, and still only sound mediocre. Jabra delivers on all those functions. Out of the box they sound good, but with a little tweaking through the Sound+ app they sound amazing! They connect no problem and do not drop out, unless of course you take one earbud out then as it should the music stops playing. The voice quality is on point, it cancels out background noise so the caller can hear you clearly. I believe this is thanks to the four microphone placement, which picks up on your voice with ease. The battery life is extremely acceptable considering they are completely wireless. In a full shift at work i can listen for most of my shift and if they are low on juice I pop them in the case for a half hour and they are good to go again. They stay secure in my ear with no worry of jiggling loose, however I highly recommend putting great focus on testing out and finding which tips are the best seemless fit. I thought I wore a medium but tried the large and noticed how much more of a seal I had achieved. With that seal the sound is at its peak performance. The rest of the headphone sits nicely so that it is not rubbing all day against the tender parts of your ear canal. Lastly, the hearthrough function... Wow. Now this function relies heavily on 2 factors. One, the microphone. Two, the software. With the Bragi I could barely just sense loud bangs or someone screaming at the top of their lungs, but Bragi had only one mic placed terribly on each earbud. Jabra has 4, yes 4 microphones with 2 of them jutting out towards your face. As for the software I cannot say but I can actually HEAR people, including myself,  if they are trying to get my attention. The app also allows you better control over the function.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like listening to music some, but mainly I need headphones/earbuds for conference calls at work. Many reviews I read across the internet touted these ear buds as the best for being noise cancelling, but I found very little information anywhere on call / mic quality when I'm on a conference call (how well can OTHERS hear YOU). I took a chance on these ear buds and thankfully after my conference call this morning, I found that I was very clear sounding to those on the other end of the call and I could hear the others on the call quite well. My coworker said if I'd hadn't told him I was listening via true wireless ear buds he would have sworn I was using a headset with a mic. I'm very pleased with those results! Hopefully someone will find this review useful. I realize many people just by wired headsets/headphones for conference calls because of mic quality, however I wanted something I could use in the office and outside of the office (I travel a lot and needed a good product for listening to movies and music on the plane).

The battery life is awesome too, you can wear them beyond 5 hours with the volume at mid however if you want to crank the sounds you will get about 5 hours and a VERY quick recharge about 20-30 min and you are back in the game.  Lastly you will experience some cut out if you place it in your left pocket otherwise very minimal cut out love these BUDS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have no Quams doing it either. These wireless ear buds have superior sound quality and with the EQ customizing sound to your choice is a pleasure. Very easy to set up and bind via Bluetooth. Volume control and on off control are readily accessible. It takes a bit of practice to use the buttons but I found I was using the buttons in a few hours. It’s great to have everything from volume to battery level all accessible via two buttons!  I have read some reviews where users had difficulty putting the earphones into position to charge. Read the manual!! There is no need to align the earphone connectors to make contact with the brass contacts in the charger case. Just make sure you put the phones in the correct charging holes left/right and close the lid. The lid is designed to push the buds snugly against the charging contacts. There is absolutely no need to align the buds. They will be aligned once the cover is closed.
I have 4 wireless sets of ear buds and as many wired. None of them can compete with the Jabra 65!! Get them. Yes they are a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.

They had good reviews, the colors are fun, and I was so pumped to be totally wireless!
I was very quickly disappointed. For starters, they hurt to wear...now that I’ve had them a couple of months I have gotten used to that...sort of. But the biggest issues I have with them:

1. If you sweat a lot they do not stay in. In really intense workouts they fall out and I have to dry them and my ear and put them back in. Total pain.

2. The left earbud does not always pair. The only way I’ve found to fix is to take both ear buds out, put them back in container, close the lid, wait a few seconds, then take them out of the box and put back in ear.

3. The hear through feature only seems to work on the right earbud. I am not sure if I have a faulty pair or if this is normal.

If I had bought these myself rather than received as a gift, I would not have kept them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_403?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=403&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've contacted customer support, so we'll see what they say about those things.

I bought these because they're the top recommendation on Wirecutter for wireless earbuds, and they're allegedly the unanimous ""best AirPods alternative"" on Android.

Audio cuts out for me in the left earbud constantly. Sound quality and volume is great when it actually works. At first I thought this was just a connectivity issue, but moving the headphone around and re-setting it back in its charge case seems to re-align something to fix it temporarily, but only temporarily. It seems like something in the internals gets out of whack and you have to get it to set just right for it to work correctly.

I'm going through Amazon's ""replace and return"" option now and hoping the replacement doesn't have this issue. A quick Reddit search came up with tons of troubleshooting q&a's along with other suckers like me who expected this to work the first time out of the box.

The headphones work great for calling, microphone picks up much better than I expected. I just wish these worked in the left earbud more than 50% of the time I'm using them. Dealing with one earbud cutting in and out is so infuriating, especially since I got these so I could be hands-free while commuting on the train to work. The quality issues are frankly unacceptable for a product at this price level. These are pricier than AirPods!

That said, I'd be willing to pay easily 25% more for these if they actually worked.

I wanted to like the because they had all the features I want: noise cancelling, an app that allows you to tweak it and an EQ. Water proof, supposed to stay in during jogging and box jumps.
I will add one more thing for the designers, that bulb at the bottom that sits in the depression of the ear lobe is too big for some, when I could get it to seat properly and stay it still hurt having them on.

9 days with repeated attempts to contact Jabra customer service.  I noticed Jabra has people watching Amazon reviews and posting comments... too bad they don't have people in customer service returning calls and emails.  $170 and they lasted less than 2 months.  I should have bought some of the $40 knock-off ones... I thought the extra money spent on the name brand (Jabra) provided quality and customer service.  I was ripped off.

*********

Three things I have never been good at:
(1) Remembering to turn things off
(2) Remembering to plug things in to charge
(3) Putting things back in their case

My favorite feature of the 65t was that I could accomplish all three with just one action; specifically, placing the device into the case triggered auto-off and initiated charging (I kept the case plugged in on my desk).  Phone rings… pop the case open, pull out the buds (which turned on automatically) and I was ready to take the call.  If listening to music when interrupted by a visitor, I could simply pull them from my ears, drop into the case, close the lid, and the devices turn off (disconnects from phone and music stops).  No fumbling to stop the music or turn them off to keep the battery from draining.  I was the envy of the office…

Just under 2 months in and the auto on/off has stopped working.  How did I find out?  Well, buds were in the case (on my desk, as usual) but still on and connected (without me knowing).  After multiple missed calls (the buds were connected and therefore “ringing” when the call came in) I realized they weren’t turning off.  If I turn off manually, then I have to fumble around to turn on manually (both of them) before I can take a call.  Tried reseting… no luck.  Tried un-pairing and re-pairing… no luck.  Contacted Jabra customer service… luck???  Waiting to hear back.  If they work then they are 5 stars for me… until then the best (and most generous) I can give is two stars; one for each month they worked.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The left earbud either cuts out or stops working altogether.  I ordered them in spite of that.  I was initially very happy with the product and would have absolutely agreed with the comments on the best of lists.  That is until 2 days after I got them the left earbud started cutting in and out and shortly afterwards stopped working completely.  It was fully charged but just never connected to my phone or the right earbud ever again.  I tried every solution on the internet.  I contacted Jabra and tried all of their solutions.  Nothing.  Initially Jabra's customer service was very responsive but the second I needed to send the product back in for a replacement they suddenly became waaaaaaaaay less responsive (another complaint in the user reviews).  I couldn't get them to send me a return shipping label.  Well, I decided that I didn't want to wait multiple weeks because of their crappy customer service.

Sound quality is decent.
Connectivity was initially good.
The ""hear through"" feature is cool and actually worked well.

Negatives:
After a few uses the left unit would choose not to reconnect after being removed from the ear.  This could be fixed by putting it in the charging case, then removing it and reattempting.
The case itself is difficult to open, and works reliably only by squeezing the plastic on the sides to ""pop"" the top.  Not sure how this was what they went with vs. a magnetic or other functional latching system everyone else seems to be managing with ease.
If you've been an AirPod user, you'll expect them to stop playing your song/book when you remove a unit.  They do this about 60% of the time, which is not enough to make it a feature you won't count on - so you go back to manually pausing like the old days.  I actually had them pause successfully, then heard them start playing again on their own a few seconds later sitting on my desk with contacting nothing.
The ear fit is via 3 different cushion sizes.  If one is for you then you'll be happy.  For me the small was so loose the sound quality was extremely poor.  The medium was too tight leading to discomfort, and the feeling that I was wearing earplugs.
As a final quality indicator, I dropped my left unit on the tile kitchen floor from waist height.  There's something rattling inside and now neither unit will connect.
I'm glad some consumers are enjoying these, but I really couldn't recommend them.  Especially considering the number of options at this price point.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They come with 3 different silicone tip sizes to help you get the perfect fit. I do many different types of cardio and never have an issue with them feeling loose or slipping out. Battery life is OK and the charging case fits into any pocket or purse.

I can definitely see myself wearing these out in a short amount of time due to how often I use them. And when that happens, I'll go right back out and buy another pair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ever.","This is the first and only review I have ever written and I use Amazon for 90+% of ever purchase I make. That's how amazing these things are! Best sound quality I've ever heard, across all devices, speakers, headphones, any and everything that makes noise. The bass is mind blowing! They're also the most convenient thing I own. Auto pause when you remove one of the buds from your ear, auto power on and off, the speak through function allows you to still hear the environment around you because of the amazing quality of the noise cancelling, it never runs out of battery because of the auto charging dock which holds 5 full charges (I believe... It may be 2, I don't remember but it honestly doesn't matter because they havent died once) literally the only downside to these bad boys would be damaging them or losing them and jabra has you covered there too with the water resistance, 2 year warranty, and freaking GPS track. Are you kidding me?!? I know I sound like a fan girl(I'm actually a 31yr old man), but seriously this is the single most amazing product I've ever purchased. I work at a body shop with lots of loud noises and a dirty environment and these things have kept up every step of the way. I cannot overstated the value of these things or how highly I recommend them. Quit worrying about the price and buy them. You'll be glad you did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have these as well as the Beoplay E8 earphones. I purchased both planning to return one of the two pairs but never did. Never returned the Beoplay E8's because they just sound amazing but if I were forced to choose, I would choose the Jabra's. The Beoplay E8's do sound great, but you wouldn't really be missing out on anything if you just went and purchased the Jabra's.

These things are all around amazing. The sound is great and they are more than loud enough (if they aren't loud enough for you please stop wearing earphones and see a physician). They fit extremely comfortably in my ears which is a huge feat because I have small and oddly shaped ears and have never (until now) found earphones that can fit in my ear comfortably and stay there. Another awesome thing I love about these is how easy it is to connect via bluetooth. Once you connect them to a device all you need to do is take them out and put them on. Usually by the time they are in my ear they are already paired and they can take 2 devices which is also awesome if you are always working with a computer. Because of this I find myself using these much more often than the Beoplays (which also says a lot as I am one of those audiophile types and the Beoplays have AMAZING instrumental separation to the point where you hear everything and in a well balanced manner).

They don't really have the best sound isolation (the Beoplay's absolutely clear outside noise; it's like wearing over-ear headphones with awesome passive noise cancellation). With these, you will definitely hear some outside noise but it isn't absolutely terrible, just raise the volume a little and you should be good as long as you don't destroy your hair cells. That said, they do have a cool hear-through feature which works ok (Beoplays are actually better at this somehow).

Lastly, these things are great with phone calls which makes sense; from my understanding this is the area of tech that Jabra really has it's roots in and it shows. Easy to take calls (I have it set up to my phone's default voice command system so it may differ by device but if I get a call I can just say ""Answer"" or ""Ignore"") and everyone sounds very clear. I'm not sure how I sound on the other end but haven't had anybody tell me anything yet so must mean something (I made a call with the Beoplays once and they told me they couldn't hear me very well).

All that said if you are looking for true wireless earphones and these are in your price range, take them. Don't even bother with higher-end earbuds UNLESS music is the absolute (maybe even sole) selling point for you. If you absolutely need that 3D/vast feel to the sound of your music then get the Beoplays, otherwise I absolutely recommend these over anything else ESPECIALLY those damn apple airpods. I say this because this company (Jabra) has made these absolutely amazing earbuds only for companies like Apple, that are already extremely well established, to produce poor quality earbuds at high prices for everyone to lap it up (don't get me wrong their bluetooth pairing is seemless but that is really the ONLY selling point; they're ugly, sound crappy, are expensive, have no sound isolation, etc.)

I get pretty sweaty on long runs, my ears included. Every now and then I’ll have a run where one side seems to slip a bit and I need to adjust it every 5-10 mins, but for the most part they comfortably stay put. But, the main reason for my 5 star review is that after a half marathon this weekend I stuck these in my pocket, forgot about them, and washed and dried my shorts.

I know Jabra has been a player in the bluetooth headset arena for awhile. But I will admit that upon opening the well packaged pair it read ""welcome to superior sound"" I was skeptical. Well I am skeptical no more, these guys deliver in every way. Calls are clear, been told on the other end I sound clear, and connectivity is consistent. The sound reproduction for all types of music in my opinion is outstanding. The sweet spot for me is lower to mid volume, the soundstage is balanced and full. They can get a bit ""tinny"" when the volume is pushed. With that said, they are plenty loud enough. ****** Play with the different sizes of cups and settle on the largest one that you can ""stuff"" comfortably into your ear canal. It will measurably improve the bass response. The app is also very handy, you can tailor the sound with the EQ, switch the pass through mics on or off to name two.

I'm wearing them probably around 5-8 hours every day.","So I have now recommend these to EVERYONE  I see using wireless/cordless headphones. I have gotten 6 people to purchase them and they love them. The sound quality is there in my opinion they bet boss and other top of the line options that are truly wireless.

Pros:
Fitting. I have ALWAYS had trouble here, but the right head phone sits perfectly and i can keep it in for about 4/6 hours before it starts to hurt. They dont fall out and if I got on an intense run or just lounging around. I also use one when riding a motorcycle for quick trips and it stays put and still comfy in a tight helmet.

Comfort: see above statement. The only one they doesn't fit well is the left one and i think that is more of a me thing than design as it exactly the same.

Battery: Amazing. So like stated i use these a lot i my charge them twice a week.

Case: strong slick case.

App: the app is decent nothing to be mad about really the UI could be more interesting I guess, but it does the job.  Also the ear bud tracking has come in handy a couple times when I just leave it on a table or something.

CONS:
App: WHY CANT I TRACK MY CASE...

Water proof/Active use: So if you sweat so much you start having the salt come off you this will DESTROY these buds. I know they say they are but if you just got done working out and don't rigorously clean these before putting back in the case after about 4/6 month you will noticed a drop in charging, paring, audio quality etc.  I actually got them replaced because of this.

Warranty replacement: OKAY with some grains of salt, they took FANTASTIC  care of me for my warranty replacement, but to get to that point it seems super rigid, complicated, and I almost just didnt do it due to the initial hassle. Guys if I have your app left me do the entire warranty replacement from the app..

OVERALL: Buy them. Enjoy, and promote the product if you truly enjoy and want to see more from them. Give feedback on the pros and con's you find so the next series will be even better.

My first impression with these earbuds was positive but quickly noticed that I could only hear sound out of one (the left) bud.

Like cheap plastic. A child's toy. Without a magnetic connection from H'phones to charger (like the Bose SSF), other than charging contacts, it's very difficult to seat them in the charger.
Another direct comparison to the Bose SSF, is that with Bose I can use one bud L or R st work. With Jabra even with the auto off set to OFF if I remove the R Jabra bud, the left one turns off! Anotjer bad news comparison to Bose SSF. the ear tips. First they must be shoved all the way into the ear canal to remain in place. Even with the smallest ear rip, it still becomes excruciating to keep in for a long period of time. In my case, 2 plus hrs of audiobook listening at work. The left bud became unstable and crackly at high volume.

But the real reason for the one for the one star rating and the last bad comparison to Bose SSF, the eartips can and do pop off open removing.  Mostly they end up falling on the floor. But this time the right rip stayed in my ear canal as I pulled out the bud!

It took a coworker performing emergency surgery with a toothpick to remove it! So back to Amazon they went.

App is better than Bose. Hear through feature is awesome. Battery life is better than Bose SSF. Sound is great as long as you push the buds through your eardrums. EQ is responsive and easy to use and unlike the Bose SSF, no lip sync issues. No cutting out, like the Bose. Firmware update  downloaded quickly.

If you like a broad range of audio adjustment, they're fantastic. Yet even with Bose's crafted sound and lack of noise cancellation the Bose SSF overall sound is light years superior to the Jabra or any other earbuds. The Bose are also far louder and remain stable without any distortion at the highest volume.

Sent the Bose SSF back to checkout the Jabra. For me it was a huge mistake and will soon be rectified.

Back to Bose to stay!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_398?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=398&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The earbuds worked well up until now.  Mainly used them specifically to listen to podcasts and news so I cannot really vouch or report anything regarding their sound quality (for music).  But its very disappointing that they only lasted less than a year before they have become unable to charge (or hold a charge).  The LED lights are confusing and the manual does a poor job at explaining why the earbuds blink red, then green for a few seconds, then back to red.  Green means a good battery charge and red means battery is exhausted and mine blink between the two and show 15% charge on my mobile device.  So basically, the batteries arent charging.  The case (which is a battery within itself) shows fully charged (green LED) but the actual earbuds dont hold a charge.  Went through all the troubleshooting steps on the Jabra support website with no luck.  I'm requesting an RMA to return.  If Jabra stands behind the product and repairs/replaced, I will be sure to write a follow up and change my rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Using an iPhone 8.

Pros:
High quality product/build.  (but can’t comment on durability after just a few days).

Almost great sound (comparing to over the ear Bose and BeatsX).

No dropping, or cutouts.

Phone App is functional.

Ease of use.

Battery life.

Cons:
This is very subjective - comfort is not ideal. The size of each bud is larger then my outer ear (ear-gel section is fine) - just my ears are smaller than the unit.

I’m hoping my ears adapt cause overall they rock! They are keepers.

The only issue that I had  was size, I have small ears and they tend to hurt after awhile in my ears so I would have to take them out for a minute.

The controls and charging/carrying case worked well.

I had to return them eventually because they didn’t fit. These come with several different sized silicone earpieces. The standard size was too big for my ears. They sealed against my ear canal so tightly that I could hear a rumbling with every step I took. The next size down eliminated that problem but at the cost of sound quality— the bass disappeared to such an extent that I couldn’t hear instruments I knew were in my music.

I’ve been dissatisfied with many of the silicone earbud headphones I’ve tried. So my guess is that if you generally don’t like silicone in-ear headphones you won’t like these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_323?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=323&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't know, its been 2 months now, ish. I've been meaning to update my review for a couple weeks when I noticed that they are no longer causing me discomfort. that could be a good thing or a bad thing so far as my ears are concerned??? Maybe they're misshapen or something now.
But the earbuds no longer cause me pain. so 4 stars instead of 2.
Day 8: Still having issues with connectivity. Spoke to Customer Service, I think my pair might be defective. going to try exchanging them tomorrow. As for comfort, They are becoming less painful. My ears must be, for better or worse, adapting to them.
Day 2: I see people rating them as the most comfortable earbuds... I want to see their ears.  I have large ears, and these things hurt. If I use the smallest foam piece that comes with it, then the cartilage in my ear hurts. aches is probably a better word. If I use one of the 2 larger sizes, my ear doesn't ache as much, so it is more bearable in that regard. But those two sizes irritate the skin around my ear canal. so wearing them make the skin around the ear canal feel like it's sunburned, or just brushburned like the skin under your nose can become during a bad cold if you're not careful.

I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality is at least as good as any other pair of earbuds that I have ever owned.

The left bud is a bit fickle in whether it connects or not. Sometimes it connects immediately. sometimes I have to hold down buttons on it to get it to connect. sometimes I have to put it in the case and close the case. the light on the case will flash yellow or purple, and then I take it out and it works. This could be a minor inconvenience, but I got these to wear at work. I can't be sitting around playing with them trying to get them to connect.

the noise canceling works pretty well. The only problem here is that the sound pass-through, when turned on, is a bit fickle. every few seconds it will stutter and not pass outside noise through. this can be distracting.

Other reviewers have wrote about the earbuds breaking after a few months, and the left one especially goes out pretty quickly... between this, my own experience with the fickleness of the left bud, and the discomfort I experience while wearing them, I will probably be returning them before I have to deal with customer service. I really wanted to like these because they have controls on them, and I can't find others with controls on them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_276?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=276&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Simple use - once paired with phone and playing Pandora.  Removing right ear bud - pause the music.  A single tap will also pause the music or restart after pausing.  A double tap allows for hear through listening and if the music is stopped they actually provide some amplification of the surrounding environment (like a hearing aid).

Pros: They are VERY loud and noise cancellation is very good. They do not all out of my ears at all and are snug. I like the function where you can hear ambient nose while listening which is perfect for working in office areas. The battery life is insane. The ear buds last over 3 hours and the case they give you is an additional battery which will charge them without being plugged in to %100. When taking phone calls, I have not had a pair of headphones that are as clear on both ends than these. Siri also works very well.

Cons: Every once and a while the connection will be lost only from 10ft. but finds itself right way. When pushing my self in the gym they tend to work their way out of my ear which seems to be standard anyway. There are times that my ear begins to hurt because it is so far in the canal. In order to only have one head phone in, it can only be the right side. It would be nice if i could choose which ear piece to have in the ear. This is not that big of an issue.

PROS

They connect flawlessly with my Essential PH-1, my Nintendo Switch (with HomeSpot transmitter), and my work laptop, a Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1.

Sound quality is pretty good - not as good as cans, but come on, these things are packing communication, battery, and sound production into a package the size of a marble.  They don't fizzle on extreme highs or lows like cheap earbuds.  They isolate sound pretty well if you don't have HearThrough on, which is a software feature that will intentionally let an adjustable amount of outside noise in - I don't want to get smooshed in a crosswalk by a siren I can't hear, so it's a nice feature to be able to toggle on and off.

Battery life is great.  I haven't flatlined the earbuds themselves because I usually use them for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.  I charge the case once or twice a week.

The charging case is sleek and secure.  No satisfying magnetic POP like Airpods, but the buds settle in without a lot of fuss with little notches where the microphone portion settles in.  The buds will blink red when they've made contact with the charging prongs, an LED between the buds shows their battery level, and an LED on the bottom shows approximate case battery level (green/yellow/red).  Pretty informative little package!

CONS

I am disappointed with their performance as a phone headset, especially coming from Jabra.  People on the other side often complain about every noise in the background getting picked up - a car horn a block away sounds as if it's two feet away.  If you're in a relatively quiet environment, they work great.  If you're not, though, they will amplify everything.

The buttons are not easily triggered.  Best thing to do is anchor the bud with your thumb and middle finger and navigate with your pointer... or just give up and change it on your phone like we had to in the good ol' days.

Sometimes the left one won't connect at first, so I'll drop them back in the case and put them back in.

Comfort is so-so.  I have small ears.  Someone bought me Airpods as a gift and the hard plastic killed my ears after just 15 minutes.  The soft tips on these are infinitely better, though after two hours my ears could still use a break.  They hurt more when I first got them, so there is some getting used to them.

OVERALL

If Airpods aren't your thing, these are a viable contender.  The case is slightly larger than the Airpod case and much less floss-like.  They're amazing for what they are - a pocket-sized set of headphones with a good battery life.  I like that the whole case + buds fit in my tiny girl jean pockets and I don't have to wear them around my neck.  If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones to add to your everyday carry list, these would be a great contender.  However, if you're looking for comfort and solid quality sound, I'd recommend a nice pair of over-ears instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can compare these with the Zolo Liberty+. I was an early backer of the Liberty+ and have to say that I've been very impressed with the sound quality of those buds. The problem is that the Liberty+ HURT my ears after a few hours of wear.

I was hesitant about pulling the trigger on the Elite 65t mainly because I've never known Jabra for anything music-related. Boy am I glad I took the chance. The sound quality is on par with the Liberty+ but different. The Liberty+ goes slightly deeper but the detail and clarity of the 65t is MUCH better.

Phone call quality is much better on the 65t; the call comes through in both ears and there are many more options for answering (or not) calls. The controls on the headset are much more expansive than on the Zolo's. Taking one of the earbuds out of the ear pauses the music, re-inserting the bud restarts the music. This is a neat feature.

Fit: I'm able to get a good seal with the supplied silicone tips but I have ordered a set of Comply foam tips to test comfort. My left ear develops a little bit of soreness, seemingly emanating from the tragus area, after several hours of listening but these are MUCH more comfortable than the Liberty+.

I think these deserve the high marks; for me they're the best option available right now for truly wireless earbuds. I've not tried an extensive range of sets so take that in the spirit it's intended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once in a while though there is a product that i will buy that i find myself thinking, ""how did i life without it before i had it."" The Jabra elite active 65t have been that product. I am in college and spend 12 hours on campus two days a week. I constantly have one ear bud in at all times, unfortunately only the right bud works without the other. the lift does not work alone. So if you lose the right bud, you are screwed. With that being the only down side, the battery life is great i think, they stay in the ear really well, while running, lifting and every day use they are very comfortable to keep in. sometimes i forget that i have them or just one bud in my ear. they look professional and are small enough that not many people notice them in your ear. I personally think these are the best true wireless earbud you can buy

I was out on the trail running, and the right earbud sounded a little scratchy, then died.  I thought maybe I hadn't charged them properly, so I recharged.  The left earbud puts out normal sound, the right is nearly inaudible.  You can hear it inside when it's quiet, but it is too faint to hear outside.  For nearly $200, I would hope that these would, at least, last 6 months, but they did not.

After some research, I found a couple of ""workarounds"" to remedy this relatively common situation.  However, after trying all of the online fixes, I have nothing.  One good earbud, one with barely any sound.

Other than this most obvious issue, these were pretty good earbuds.  They occasionally lose audio, if you crank your head to one side running, which is not often (hopefully!).  They stick in place dry, but will work themselves free when you are sweaty.  It is not a huge deal, but they start jarring free, and I was constantly adjusting them.  A slight twist every mile or so is not a gamechanger, but it is annoying.  Granted, I wore these mainly for marathon training, so they were in my ears for hours at a time.

The battery life is good, and the sound quality is pretty good too.  You won't get a great sound experience, but they are not bad for small wireless buds.

If it weren't for the loss of sound in my right earbud, this would have been a 4 star review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love them, but there are some quirks they need to work out.

PROS:
- Sounds quality is excellent with a nice balanced profile
- The EQ feature is exactly what I wanted and let me get the sound just right
- Fit is secure (a little uncomfortable at first but you can get used to them
- Battery life is excellent
- Controls are tactile and solid
- Calls just work. They are great.

CONS:
- Sound seems to be louder on the left side? Or the stereo image is shifted to the left ear slightly? (if anyone else has this issue please comment below)
  - I noticed this right away and had the same issue with a replacement pair
  - There also seems to be more bass in the left ear

I rarely give 5 star reviews. These deserve it.

i was looking for something that would stand up to sweat during exercise, sound good, and block out wind noise. i have a drawer full of ear buds from Bose, Panasonic, Shure, etc... None worked well.

Despite having some issues with pairing 2 devices at once at first, my PC and phone connect every day without any problems. The audio hand-off is sometimes a little funky, but that could be because of a USB bluetooth adapter on my PC rather than the headphones themselves. The HearThrough feature is great for keeping them in at the office or out and being active. Battery life is solid, too. I've been able to wear them for almost an entire workday, only having to take a break to charge them while I make lunch. Battery life is better without HearThrough as well, and the case is good for about a day and a half to 2 days before needing a charge. The only complaint I have is the bass is kinda disappointing, even with the equalizer. I really have to jam them into my ears for better bass and, while they don't fall out of my ears, they do shift a little bit and cause the bass to diminish. Honestly not a dealbreaker though.

It worked well out of the box. I liked how compact they are and the battery life. Sound quality was decent - not as good as Bose but the had a better fit and less bulk. However, after a few months I ran into intermittent issues with the left earbud not working. The fix is to put the buds back in the case and try again, and this usually got the left bud to ""wake up"". This happened enough times that I contacted tech support at Jabra. It is best to call by the way. If you communicate by email the average turnaround time from them to respond is 2-4 days (but they do respond). Their response is always the same - reinstall the firmware. Despite doing this, the left bud still sometimes did not work. I decided to just live with this issue as it was infrequent but annoying. But recently the right earbud stopped working. When I contacted Jabra, not surprisingly, they asked me to reinstall firmware and even do seemingly strange things like change the default language of the buds. None of this worked. Eventually I got the bud to come back to life by just tapping on the housing of the bud. When it did come back, its output was below that of the left. After multiple rounds of Jabra asking me to play with the firmware, they finally had me ship them back to them at their cost. They then told me they are going to replace them under warranty, but then immediately told me they are on backorder and gave no firm date on when they would be available. So now I have no earbuds and no date for a replacement. Whatever initial excitement I had about these earbuds is lost. I'm not happy with their durability and think their responsiveness to address this issue could be far better. I am regretting abandoning Bose for Jabra and considering I have no earbuds now and no date for replacement, I will be shopping for a new pair and I will not be buying Jabra again.

2 issues prevent me from giving it a 5 star rating.
1. the case is not easy to open, once closed.  I actually have to use 2 thumbs, apply fair amount of pressure to pop open the lid.  I've seen a co-worker's apple air pods and the case easily pops open without much effort at all since it is magnetic.
2.  I've tried every ear bud provided from the smallest to the largest.  these ear buds are not the easiest to stay in the ear.  I can actually feel them sometimes working themselves loose to where they have fallen out and I've had to catch them before they hit the ground.  Jabra should have included an over the ear attachment as an accessory for folks like me when their is a fit issue.  One of my colleagues has a Bose with an over the ear attachment and he loves it even though his is wired.  C'mon Jabra - you can do better!

Hopefully their product development will contact me if they have an over the ear attachment because I waited too long and can no longer return these.  I guess I just have to grind these into my ear until they stay in place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once in a while they don't connect to the phone right and I have to put them back in and pull them back out. Once had to restart the phone though, but I think that was more of the phones issue with Bluetooth. I can walk around my house without much worry while listening. The pass through though isn't as good as I hoped, its pretty much turning on the voice mic and you are hearing it all like that. You can definitely tell a difference with it on verse when it is not, but I was hoping for better.

I've used them for working out, never had an issue with them falling out, when you get them in, they stay in.

I expected a much more light gold/pearl color earbud, and instead received an ugly flat ivory/gold pair and also look much larger in my ear than I had anticipated. As soon as I put them in, I thought to myself that they look like hearing aids, and when I saw the other person's Amazon review indicating the same, knew I wasn't crazy.

I tested them out for a bit and they were super easy to pair, sound quality seemed very good (compared to much less expensive wireless earbuds I have purchased on Amazon), and the button press controls seemed intuitive. However, I could tell they would become quite uncomfortable after extended periods of time. Not only are they large, but you have to press the buttons (especially on the left bud which controls volume and song skipping) pretty hard to get them to work, which presses them in to your ear even more, and that ends up hurting after a while. However, I will say that when I first put them in, they fit very snugly and I would not hesitate to use them for working out.

I am going to go with my first pick and try out the Samsung Galaxy Buds instead as they are supposed to have a sleeker profile than these. If I didn't already have the Galaxy Buds in mind, I would stick with the Jabras but go for the black color.

**EDIT 7/21/19**: I ended up buying the Samsung Galaxy Bud and enjoy them significantly more. Rather than buttons, they function by gestures (ie, tap once for play/pause, tap twice for next song/answer call, etc.), and you can customize  what you want a long hold to do in the app that connects to the buds. In addition, they are smaller and have a much sleeker profile as I had expected!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_306?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=306&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They look nice, fit comfortably (unless you want to use them for working out, in which case you'll be chasing them across the gym!), charge easily and sound decent. I thought they were the whole package, and they were, for a few weeks. Then everything started to go downhill.

Major drawbacks:
- Left ear buzzes constantly, and for no apparent reason. This started about 5 days after the return period expired and hasn't stopped. Occasionally i can get it to go away for a song or two if i reset the earbuds multiple times, but there isn't a consistent fix.
- You can use the right earbud by itself, but not the left one. This is a design flaw, and often leads to inadvertent automatic pausing.
- Connection drops all the time, even when i am sitting at my desk mere feet from my phone. I don't have this problem with other products connecting to my phone via bluetooth. This was a real problem, as my phone would play my music for the whole office to hear when the earbuds cut in/out every couple of minutes.
- Interference is a huge problem with this model for some reason. They are almost worthless in airports/stadiums/malls/gyms/anywhere there are multiple connected devices operating. I've tested other wireless headsets in the exact same areas, and they worked just fine.
- Don't even bother trying to get Jabra to honor their product warranty. That's just a waste of everyone's time and patience. They are well aware of the connection/interference/static issue, and don't seem to care/know how to fix it. This was my first and last Jabra purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I debated and did bunch of research between Active and Elite.  The main concern was battery life due to the step in Active and Elite falling out.  Well, it never fall out for me so I'm satisfy.

Pro
- Wireless and can connect to multiple device.  I use it for my PC and cell phone.
- Rapid charging and last ~5 hours.
- Wireless charging in the case is one of the main reason why I bought it.  Didn't like my previous wireless needing to plug into the earbud to charge
- Charging the case is fast.  I'm not sure if the case have rapid charging capability but within 1 hours, my case is full.
- Regular Elite 65T does not drop out of the ear.  Make sure you rotate it after you put it in.  I ran on the treadmill for hours multiple days and no sign of it falling at all.  Even the sweat didn't affect it much (except making it a bit more slippery when I took it off)
- No voice out of sync at all when watching movies
- Hear-through is great.  I haven't try too much in public places but I can definitely hear sound from further away if my slider is up high.  It would also amplify my key press while typing this review.  Only recommend if you want awareness.
- There is an equalizer in the apps, but almost every music apps have them too.  I don't play around with those, just standard guy who listen to music as is.
- The Sound apps also have background music if you want to go sleep like Oceans wave or Rainy background.  Not sure if that the purpose of it though,  Have 3 profile, Regular, Commute and Focus (study mode)

Con
- Randomly drop signal for 1 sec like once every 3-5 hours?  I'm ok with it but many like it to be perfect.  I also notice, if the device you connecting to have crappy bluetooth, you can expect some signal loss.  With my S8 phone, no signal drop at all.
- I prefer that my Right Earbud, pressing it once would automatically activate my voice assistant like Ok Google or Alexa.  I have to press the button then say those command.  Just a personally preference.
- Don't really like pressing buttons into my ear, but something I can get use too.

So I sacrifice my body for some numbers.  I would not listen for 5 hours straight next time.  Stopwatch and battery level based on the Sound apps at 50-75% volume.  This is for my Earbud.  Yours may be different but it should give you a picture somewhat.

1hr 03min 92%
1hr 12min 88%
2hr 03min  62%
2hr 45min  50%
3hr 13min  43%
4hr 10min 23%
4hr 39min 9%  Battery low announcement
4hr 49min 4%
4hr 53min 2% Dead

Now, here the thing with Rapid Charging using a fully charged case.  It blew my mind compare to what was advertised:  10-15min charging for addition 1.5hr music.
I did exactly 10min charge = 52% so based on my stats, that about 2hr

Overall, it was a hefty price to pay but was worth it since I really needed wireless earbud to PC usage.  I first did Large left and Medium right but the left side got really uncomfortable after 30min.  End up doing Med/Med but keep noticing that my right ear felt loose/strange.  I just swab to left Med and right Large and it feel better now.  Trial and error.  I really hope it last for 1-2 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted to give these a try to see if they would might be better.  So far, the one area that they are definitely better is their fit and comfort.  They fit almost completely in my ears, where the Bose hang way out and are very large.

I'll update this review as I have more time with these, but so far, I am very happy with them.  They are at least as good as the Bose in sound quality, comfort, and usability, and are far better in weight, size, and fit.

See the attached photo for a comparison of the size of these compared to the Bose.

// Update //

I've been using these for a week now, and although I didn't have any complaints about the Bose Soundsport Free Headphones, I definitely prefer these Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds.  They work very consistently, sound great, and are much smaller and lighter in my ears.  They get the full five hours of promised battery life.  I'm really happy with them.

One thing that these Jabra headphones definitely do better than the Bose ones is YouTube on an iPad.  With the Bose there is a huge delay that makes them largely unusable for video.  With these Jabra buds there is no noticeable delay.

Since I'm an android user, I've been looking for something comparable to the airpods that will work as well for android. This is as close as I've been able to find so far.

The Good:
1) I've only heard the two earpieces get out of sync once in the three days I've owned this...surprisingly while I was writing this review.  Most true wireless earbuds I've used, the left ear piece would randomly lose sound and come back in again.
2) To turn them on, you just remove them from the case. To turn them back off, just put them in the case. With cheaper earbuds I've tried, you had to hold both buttons down on both earpieces to turn them on and off, so this is much nicer.
3) When you pull one earbud out of your ear, it pauses whatever music you are playing.
4) Much more comfortable than the air pods.These actually tightly seal in your ear, so I find that I can actually play the music much more quietly, as it is not competing with other noise.

The Bad:
1) This is small, but I believe the air pods have a feature when you reinsert the pods into your ears, the music beings to play again. The Jabra earbuds do not have that feature. You have to push the button on the right earbud to start the music when it is paused, which is followed by a loud beep.

Update 03/20/2018: It looks like these earbuds do have the feature where the music does begin to play again once re-inserted in to your ears. It does not work on the Pixel XL, but I was able to get that feature to work on the One Plus 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_301?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=301&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had these for four months now and can confidently say these are 100% worth it. At work (server admin), grocery store, etc. The feel is great, they will not fall out of my ear even though I try.

The look is compact and trendy. Most don't even notice them. The touch buttons on them to pause music/videos work flawlessly. Netflix, YouTube, Google Music, even downloaded movies. Pause and play with one touch. Even when my phone screen is off.

Bass quality can be good for truly wireless earbuds. The app that lets you configure (equalizer) the ear buds on the fly works great. The app itself I've not run into any problem at all. If you aren't confident using the equalizer, there are a few preset modes that work great too. I can even use these with my switch with Genki Switch Bluetooth Adapter (humanthings.co).

+Holy crap! The call quality on these babies is nothing short of revolutionary! Crystal crystal clear voice going both ways. Taking a call and talking to someone is seem less.

+ Noise cancellation is good but not the best. There is a passthrough option that turns on and let's all sound pass through if enabled that is an amazing feat.

+ Battery life is by far the best on the market (still!) And four months later is still holding strong. Maybe 4ish hours of constant use, and I have the equalizer to emphasize the bass to that no doubt t uses more power.

+ Range is maybe 20 feet If in direct line of the device. Through a wall and 10-11 feet away I can still hear perfectly fine.

+ I have not seen ANY audio delay at all when watching Netflix, YouTube or Google Movies

- The carrying case is a rubberized matte that charges the earbuds. The ear buds just lay inside there and the top clicks shut. If you drop it, the ear buds will go tumbling about.  But overall it generally won't open on it's own in your pocket.

+ Tested with Google Pixel 2 XL, Google Pixel 3 XL, Motorolla G6, Asus Maximus Formula X Motherboard (built in Bluetooth), Genki Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Adapter. I cannot recommend these enough. I tried my significant others Air Buds from Apple and these blow them away. I cannot stress how great these are.

First, the sound is great and they stay in my ears well. Especially like the ability to block sound (great for airplanes) or to let outside sound in (great when outdoors near traffic).

What I don’t like is the connectivity. I have to clear all previous connections even if I am using the same device.  It connects but takes several extra steps.  My other wireless earbuds connect quickly so this is an issue with the Jabra product.

My other issue is dropped signal. Thes work well with a phone but only if it is in my right pocket or if I’m not moving. I wear my iWatch on my left hand and it is a joke trying to walk or run and listen to music from the watch. The earbud receiver is on the right ear and when your arm swings behind your body the signal drops.  Doesn’t happen with every stride but I have yet to make it through one song without multiple drops. A product at this price shouldn’t have this issue.

Works OK for phone calls but I prefer my $20 headset instead. I give this 3.5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_352?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=352&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This listener is satisfied.","Dealing with earbuds is a finicky thing. So much revolves around how they fit your ears, size of ear canal, etc. I have oddly shaped ears, in a way that usually i end up with different size silicone for each one to get a solid fit. This set of buds is no different, and initially I was hesitant to purchase after reading reviews. But I went ahead anyways. Overall i give it 4 stars. good set, surprised me in some ways (fit was better then i expected), and disappointing in some ways (reception). Sorry for the long review, lots of little things about this set (plus a few tips on fit and use). So I provided a summary. you can read the rest below.

PRO:
Good fit, even with my finicky ears.
Nice sound
App has nice features
No cord.

CONS:
Fit is all or nothing. very dependent on the earbud shape fitting into your earlobes.
App is cumbersome and non intuitive.
No Cord (seriously, it's too easy to drop one of these and have it bounce under the table. never happens with my corded buds. Having a cord comes in handy at times like these).
Reception is bad, left side is finicky with connecting at times (connection is solid once it does connect). songs hiccup too often.
:
1) Fit
I was actually surprised at how well they fit my ears. I still had to go with 2 different sized silicone...medium for my left, large for my right. But the nature of these buds (they use the lower inner earlobe to stay in place), seems to afford them a nice fit with good external exclusion. the pass though feature allows some sound in, and is adjustable. I keep it around 20% and it seems to give me enough to hear if anythings happening around me, but still enjoy the full sound of the music at the same time.
I would recommend for a solid fit is to initially put them in with the mic extension a bit high, and then twist it down as you pull a bit on your lower earlobe. picture pulling the lobe down and around the lower side of the earbud, and you'll probably get a nice fit. after doing it a few times it gets easier and I don't feel these are any more difficult then a traditional earbud at this point. Took a few times to get it down...i kept pushing on them directly into the ear and it was painful and didn't work. the pull/twist method was much more successful.
The downside to this is the fit is all in the shape of the earbud. If it doesn't fit your ear, your not going to get good exclusion, and this affects sound quality. That being said, even with finicky ears, I still got a comfortable fit with no discomfort (usually wear time is 1-3 hours max).
Overall, these are slower to set up then my wired ones. pulling them both out of the case, setting them in each ear, often having to reconnect the left side, adds some time to it. But once they're set up, they're great. I don't have any issues with them slipping out of my ears at all, and I tend to be a heavy sweater in my workouts. My Jaybirds will usually require regular adjustments halfway through the workout. With these, I almost forgot they were there. Not having a cord bop you in the mouth every time you lay back for a bench press is a solid win as well.

2) Sound
Sound isn't bad. Decent lows and highs, and having the equalizer in the app helps, even if it is a bit basic, it's something. Fit impacts the sound quite a bit. the sound on my left side was bad until i swapped for the medium silicone, and now it works quite well. The downside to this is there are limited silicone sizes...if they don't' work for you, these earbuds suck. you can't just push them a little deeper or twist them a bit this way or that...they only have one fit, and they depend on the silicone outside of that for exclusion and sound quality. But again, even with finicky ears, the combination of the earbud and silicone worked fine.

3) Reception
This is where these earbuds missed the mark for me. multiple drops during a song on average. they are usually no more then a fraction of a second...the song hiccups, then back on track. But it is definitely an immersion breaker, and too often it distracts me...I keep waiting for a call or a text ping thinking it was interrupted due to that, but then the song kicks back in and i either have to assume it was bad reception, or run over to the phone to make sure I'm not missing an important text. Very irritating. My Jaybird v2's have a drop about once every 2-3 songs. These drop 2-3x per song sometimes. Again, small, and as I get used to it I just sigh and get back into my workout. But it's bad enough to affect the rating IMO.
Plus the left earbud seems to be very intermittent with it's connection. About 50-60% of the time when I pull them directly from the case and plug them in, the left earbud is silent. I have to power down the set (hold down button on right bud) with them in my ears, and power back up again for the left side to connect. The whole master/slave setup for the two earbuds is logical, but the left earbud needs to have better response to the right one on activation.

4) App
Having an app is nice. equalizer, adjustable settings...but the app could use some love. the main page isn't intuitive...I feel like there should be a simply set of toggles for the most used features (much like the Bluetooth and airplane modes on my phone). But instead you have to go to a sub menu and select features there, which open a third window...allot to worry about when you just want to reduce the sound that gets through. A simple control panel for the most used features (exclusion settings, equalizer, etc). would make the app actually enjoyable to use. As it is, you fiddle with initial settings and then pretty much leave it alone. It's too much of a pain to tinker with while your in the middle of a workout.

5) Other Features
the buttons on the side are very easy to use and get used to, and they're functions are probably the most intuitive I've had in an earbud setup. I had to refer to the manual a few times to get used to the full options, but I don't even think about it any more. Very nice. I have yet to really use the mikes, but on the few calls I've used them they seem to work well, no negative feedback from the people on the other side.

Quick note on the case: as others have stated, it IS slippery, and it's round shapes make it easy to drop. I found the best way to hold it is to grab it on the sides where it's flat. Same with opening the lid: I don't try to squeeze a fingernail under the silly little divet they offer on front: I grab each side of the lid with my fingers, apply a bit of pressure, and pull. It pops open easy this way, with very little chance of slipping out of your hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought these primarily because I wanted a smaller option than my over-ears (Samsung Level Over) that I can keep in my work bag all the time. These exceeded every expectation.

1) Fit and noise insulation. I am not taking these for an air flight until later this week, so I will have to hold off on commenting, I think they're probably going to be usable but nowhere near as nice as over ears. For day-to-day, they provide a very nice fit for me (they have three earbud options, they are a little flimsy and the replacements are obnoxiously priced, one of the few downsides), they're comfortable, and they're very immersive. Sound quality is not perfect, but for earbuds I think it's very satisfactory, and many reviewers rate this among the better option from a sound perspective.

2) The tech - the microphones seem to work well. These are my go to for making phone calls. The Bluetooth will simultaneously connect to two devices, e.g., phone and laptop, without dropping either one, and this works really well most of the time. This is a game changer - we have Bluetooth speakers, over ears, etc., these are the only thing I have that does this and does it well.

3) The battery and case. As others have pointed out, in 2018 the case should have a USB-c connector so I can just carry the same cable I charge my phone with. Other than this, the battery life is amazing - I'm not a heavy user, but I barely think about it, I have never run them down, and even if I did, the case would be there as a backup. With relatively sporadic use, I honestly charge the case maybe once a week or less. Aside from the micro USB port, everything is perfect about this aspect of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound is very clear and people can hear me when on the phone.  The sound quality is good and you can hear movies/music quite nicely.  They aren't quite as good as the Bose QC35s, but they aren't intended to compete with that level of product so it isn't a fair comparison.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  These are ""place in your ear"" type ear buds...not hang over your ear, etc.  You may find they just pop out for whatever the reason.  They have comfortable silicon seals that keep it in place, but I have found they will just pop out for what seems like no reason.  They will land where ever they like and you need to keep your eyes open and make sure you don't step on the bud if it happens to be in front of you.

The microphone for when talking to someone on the phone is very sensitive and not noise cancelling.  If you are in a noisy place, the person on the other end will hear these noises as well as your voice.  Even someone just talking who might be near you will be picked up.  You need to be aware of the noises around you when using these ear buds on the phone.

I bought them with one intent to use them while sleeping on a plane (instead of my Bose over the ear headphones).  I have a sleeping collar and the headphones are in the way a bit.  I have found that they really aren't very reliable for that because they do pop out as mentioned above.  I have resorted back to using the headphones so that I don't lose the ear bud on the floor, seat, or wherever it might land if it should pop out while sleeping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They play louder than some other wireless headphone (Powerbeats 3 for comparison). The issue is, if you run with them and sweat alot, the stems will clog with sweat and you'll lose sound in one or both buds. After a workout, you'll need to leave them sitting out of the case to 'dry out' for a few days, which means you can't use them to run again. In some cases, they'll dry out overnight, or after a few days, but sometimes I've had to leave them out for 7 days before sound is audible in both buds.

Also, for my ears, the stems seem to be short, which means if you do sweat, the seal will break and they could fall out, so you'll be shoving them back in your ears frequently.

I purchased these because I thought the 'active' moniker would provide more resistance to sweat/water, but that is not the case. If you don't need these for exercising, I would highly recommend them, otherwise, I'd steer clear of them. It's unfortunate, because I love the sound and functionality of these, but they simply don't work for the primary purchase I purchased them which is to run with. If it were're for the sweat issued, they'd get a 4-5 start, but obviously, since they don't work half the time, it drops to one star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The controls are surprisingly intuitive, I do wish the volume was flipped though. It works seamlessly with Google Assistant and pairing. They are low profile and nice looking.

The Bad: The shape is the worst aspect of these buds.  They determine what size ear can wear them. My ears did not fit their mold and caused discomfort when they were pushed in all the way. Speaking of... when running I noticed one bud would keep coming loose (the one that hurts my ear). I finally got it to fit but there was a trade off: not fit in/let ambient noise in/comfortable or fit in/great sound/uncomfortable. Lastly, the hearthrough is helpful in theory but if you have music playing that can be so distracting that you cannot focus on the ambient noise.

Jabra support is frustrating.  (Reversed because I think the second issue is more important.)

My second support incident occurred when the left earbud stopped pairing.  Just wouldn't connect.  I opened the support case 12 days ago.  I'm waiting on RMA instructions.  But it's been almost two weeks.  I'm sure I'll have to ship mine in before they'll either ship refurbs (gross) or deny this warranty claim.  That'll make this three weeks, at least.  Probably a month.  I would absolutely not buy these again.

My first support question: ""The medium eargels are too small and the large are too big. Is there another option? Either from Jabra or another source?""  Their response: Update my firmware.  Are you !@#$% kidding me?  Okay.  ""Um - I think there was a miscommunication or some tickets got mixed up.  I'm pretty sure reinstalling the firmware won't change the size of the tips.""  Their response: ""With what you've described, it sounds like something like the Elite Sport may be a better solution. While the Elite Active 65t only has the three ear gel sizes, the Elite Sport uses a wider selection of model-specific inserts that do work to provide an increased snug fit.""  Yeah.  The earbuds I just paid $200 for?  The manufacturer says I should have bought something else.

Note: I tried the Comply True Wireless tips, and they were okay.  Still a little small for me.  The Comply Audio Pro are better, but they don't fit in the Jabra charging case.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality and ease of use was fine, but no better than I have had in Bose previously for example. The earphones hurt my 23 year old daughter's ears. She is not small, 6' tall, so they should have been ok I would think. Anyway, I contacted Jabra to see about a refund or exchange for her set. She only wore them twice and tried the smallest ear adapter to no avail. The customer service rep, if you want to call her that, was rude, curt and had no sympathy for our situation. She said they have a strict policy of only refunding and only if defective (not f they don't fit apparently) for 30 days after purchase. So they were past 30 days when my daughter opened her Christmas present. I bought directly from Jabra to get better service than Amazon (I had read several reviews on Amazon that people had issues and Jabra would not support their products when purchased through 3rd parties - it makes no difference! - this is basically an ""as is"" purchase). No Christmas consideration or spirit at Jabra. Well I have a strict policy now. I will NEVER purchase another product from Jabra and will never recommend or support them. There are too many options out there. I hope their customer business model works for them. My guess is it won't for long. I hope future expert reviews include some customer service support aspects to their reviews of Jabra in the future so other consumers know what they are getting into whey they purchase these expensive earphones.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Jabra's are really light and not having a cable between the buds makes for a fantastic listening experience when I run.

They are a little hard to manange as they have a very rounded shape and when I take them out of the case, I almost always feel like I'm going to drop one.

The noise cancellation is a nice feature that works fairly well for the size and style. The charging case works well and they hold a good charge again for the size of the ear pods. I like the function, you aren't required to have both pods in your ear to have them work. Only complaint would be the loudness of the ear pods.

To compare I have Bose QC 35II, Jaybird Bluebud X Sport, Phaiser 760, Plantronics Backbeat Pro, etc. Most comfortable would have to be the Bose, and they have the best noise cancelling and sound. Those are over the ear headphones however. These Jabra Elite Active 65T earbuds are almost as good for noise cancelling and sound quality and are earbuds. Comfort wise the Jabra are probably better since you don't have bulky headphones on your head. For the size, comfort, lack of wires, these buds are amazing. The calling capability is also really good. I've used them for a few calls and I have had no complaints. These also stay in the ear really well. I have tested with Youtube and they are right in sync with the video, another point these win over Bose.

Pros:
* Great sound
* Good active noise cancelling
* Pass through function works and is useful
* Sound and video in sync
* Comfortable, stay in place

 Cons
* Micro USB charging port. Come on, its 2019, USB-C please.
* Not fully waterproof (rain/sweat ok).
* May be to big for those with very small ears

Suggested improvements:
* Waterproof/float
* USB-C charging port
* QI charging
* longer battery life (>8 hours)

TL:DR:
If you are in the market for truely wireless headphones, you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used to test a lot of them for a company I worked for. Largely to test in noisy rooms, nights with long talk times, comfort, batterlife etc.

This was for a personal set, and I've enjoyed the Jabra line in the past. I figured, why not?

It did not disappoint. I picked up the gold set preferring to have something a little more subtle than the black earpiece in my ear with my gray/white hair and fair skin. It was a good choice.

The only drawback right off is the ear piece itself is a bit large, it took some getting used to.

there are 3 sizes of plug adapters which go into the ear canal, soon as I got one that wasn't too small, or too big, it helped keep the ear  piece in place.

Once the ear pieces are paired with each other, I could still use one alone (RIGHT ONE ONLY).
I have a large German Shepherd that loves to pick up small things, so I have to be very careful to put it back in the charger when I'm not wearing it. When wearing both the left and right earpiece a lot of the noises around me are barely noticeable though I would not consider this a noise cancellation earplug.  The application that you use on your phone (optional) allows you to upload updates to the earpieces. It also allows you to chose various settings of white noise like woods, waves, beach, static etc. You can also select your own balance, be it sports, talking, high base or treble notes etc.

I've used them for a few days now and I love them. The charging case Is plugged in every night, though I've yet to have used it till it was dead. I take it off the charger in the morning and drop it into my satchel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The set comes with 3 sizes of earbuds, which is fab because my ears are small and the larger ones hurt my ears, so that was a plus.  I simply put the buds in my ears and turned them on.  They voice prompted me to install the iphone app and once I did that, they easily connected to my Jabra music.  I use Pandora a lot so that come up and began playing immediately.  Awesome.  The earbud has a control for volume and for skipping tracks  They also hook up to my iphone for calls.  There is a setting through the app for customizing the sound..add bass or treble.  And, you can set the sound so that ambient sounds come through, so if you're listening for your commuter train station call out, you won't miss it.  The little carrying/charging case  easily fits in my pocket.  Too bad it doesn't have a space for the little charging cord too.

They have quickly replaced my Bose Soundsport Free headphones as my go-to headphones around the house and certainly when out.  The first attraction for me was the design. They are MUCH smaller than the Soundsport Free. I can wear them while laying on a pillow without them digging into my head.  I can change my shirt without it ripping them out.  They also don’t look anywhere near as weird since they don’t stick out from my ears like the Soundsport Free.  Plus, the Jabra headphones are far more comfortable in my ears.  I have worn them at pretty much every opportunity, for hours each day since purchase, and for every phone call I have taken.  I have yet to want to remove them to give my ears a rest like I have with other headphones.

The Jabra Elite 65t sound pretty good, yet the Bose headphones still have the advantage for sound quality.  The Jabras simply cannot match the low bass or the clear highs but they sound really good.  While comparatively not offering the sound quality of the Bose the Jabras sound good enough that their comfort and size advantages easily outweigh this.

The hear-through feature is a big deal as well.  If headphones are going to be so comfortable that I will want to have them in all the time, it is nice for them to have a feature that can allow me to engage in a conversation without it being a necessity that I remove them.  By double-tapping on the right earbud I can hear everything going on around me. Another double-tap and I’m back to the passive noise reduction.  Passive, not active.

Lastly, these are excellent on phone calls.  Call audio is routed to both earbuds.  Incoming sound quality is excellent.  Not a single person has noticed that I was using headphones, with two people telling me I sounded better than I do when holding the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was excited to get my wireless earbuds and immediately used them for work and conference calls. It required better ear foams to get the noise cancellation to work, but it was worth the extra cost. Months later I took up working out and started to notice a connection loss when I had the phone in my pocket. Turning my head could completely sever the music and it became more of an annoyance than the solid product I thought I had.

After dealing with Jabra support I came to found out I was sold a defective pair of buds. They wouldn't honor fixing it because they were bought Amazon Used. The window for returning it on Amazon was so short that I never had an opportunity. So my only recourse is to use them when my phone is in the table or in my hand (in which they work fine). Saving a few dollars for a used Amazon product is a risk that is not worth it for higher priced items.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While the sound quality and fit are quite good, the persistent issues I've had make it not worth the money.

The main issue is that the charging case doesn't work often, and since dead wireless earbuds are useless, I've been using my cord headphones more often than not. I've seen some ""fixes"" for this on Reddit, but a good product shouldn't require you to fix the hardware problems yourself. Also, if you don't place the earbuds exactly right in the charging case (which is more tedious than it should be, since you have to make a light on each earbud light up), then you will end up with only one earbud that plays sound. (Meanwhile, AirPods fit into their case automatically due to the case's shape & magnetism.)

Also, the user experience could be better. It's annoying to have to reconnect them through the settings app so often (knowing that AirPods connect automatically). These also struggle to connect sometimes, so I have to turn them off and on a couple times until they finally connect. Furthermore, it's just annoying to hear the headphones announce ""DEVICE DISCONNECTED"" and ""TWO DEVICES CONNECTED"" whenever you walk within a certain radius of one of your bluetooth devices.

I know some of these sound minor, but when the product is so close to being good, but falls short in a number of ways, it's simply not worth buying. Maybe in a couple years Jabra will figure it out. Just buy the AirPods and save yourself the frustration.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_273?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=273&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think I even saw a claim of “I was skiing with these under my helmet at the person in the other end had no idea.” Which is so weird because if I’m in a call with these headphones I constantly get complaints on how extremely loud the background noise is. I went as far as recording a call while I was in an airport and Jesus, man, these things made it sound (to the other person in the call) like I was in a warzone. It picked up noises I didn’t even hear and blared them over the call.

Overall, if you’re buying these with the expectations of making calls in public areas, don’t bother.

UPDATE: So, now the right headphone just stopped working intermittently. Only had them for about 3 months, mostly used on flights and such. So, I can’t use them with just one headphone in since you can’t use the left one alone. I contacted support but they needed the original receipt and unfortunately I already returned the ones I bought from amazon originally because they came in the wrong color and the box looked opened, the pair I currently have I bought from another store and didn’t keep it. Bad call on my part, but I guess I didn’t expect them to break so soon. Won’t be buying anymore jabra products. These things are far more expensive than they’re worth. They don’t do anything better than the dozens of other wireless headphones.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_318?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=318&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He said they were the best headphones you'd ever owned, and he is owned quite a few, so I didn't even bother looking at the reviews on this site.

My first pair came in, and they were really hard to get into my ear, but eventually they fit, and the sound was excellent. However, as I started to move around, the left ear started to lose its connection every now and then. I went through the troubleshooting that the forums told me I could do, but it appeared I just had the bad set of headphones. So, I requested a replacement.

The replacement came quickly, and the left ear had the exact same problem straight out of the box. I updated the firmware, I did all things I was supposed to do, but I appeared to have had a second set with the exact same problem.

Great sound. Noise cancellation is perfect even when something quiet is playing (as long as you pick the correct tips). The call quality is clear and the app is well made. It even has a feature (Soundscape) which will play relaxing sounds of nature to help you relax (like rain for example).

Even better than the noise cancellation is the audio passthrough which allows sound to bypass the noise cancellation through the four mics. It's accessed by a double press on the right ear. It's one of those things that sounds like a gimmick at first but is becomes a requirement on all future purchases. It balances the incoming sound perfectly with whatever's playing so you won't miss your song when someone talks to you or vice versa.

The base could be slightly deeper but I'm comparing to my $250 over-ear Sony headphones.

Another feature that I really like is the ability to turn on or off the outside sounds while using the earbuds.  This is a great feature that makes  the earbuds complete.  I would easily give these earbuds 5 stars if you could use either ear bud in solo mode. Currently, you can only use the right earbud by itself, which I do most of the time.

I have been using the JLab Audio Epic2's the past 18 months.  They have not been staying in my ears all that well, and sweat was getting in my ears.  When they sealed well they had excellent bass (which I like for workouts).  I have been looking for something else. Totally unrelated I happened to lose them somewhere on a short hike where I had them around my neck (really!!!).

Based on reviews I had narrowed it down between the Jabra Elite Active 65t and the Bose Soundsport Free.

In 2014 I compared the Creative Sound Blaster Roar vs Bose SoundLink Mini side by side and the Roar was the obvious winner.  That said, I do have Bose FreeSpace 51's I purchased in 2004, and still using them.  In general the boominess of the Bose sounds good, but as soon as you compare it with something else you feel that a lot is missing.

From the many reviews I read, the bass on the Bose was better. Bass on the 65t's seemed like a mix bag, some people think its great and some people think it is tinny. The Bose did zero sound isolation whereas the 65t had the same mixed bag.  Sound isolation is important to me for the gym.

As I mentioned, bass is very important to me. Knowing that a good seal is the key to bass, I figured it was all about getting the buds to seal and I was correct.  The small and medium tips did not seal and left me with a tinny sound and no sound isolation.  Using the large tips got a good seal, which meant good sound isolation and good bass response.  I wear earplugs every night so I do not mind the feel of a good seal, but some people might not find it comfortable.  I have worn them for an hour with no comfort issues at all.

I use the 65t's with several phones, but for my power walk/runs I use it with my Jelly Pro strapped on my left arm. Unfortunately there was a huge problem with sound cut out, so I had to switch the Jelly Pro to my right arm and have had zero issues since.  I blame the Jelly Pro but I should mention I never had the issue with the Epic2's (but of course the bluetooth transmitter was on my neck as opposed to in my right ear).

The Elite Active 65t's sound is much better than the Epic2's. The Epic2 might have had a titch better deep bass, but even that was muddier than the 65t's.  The 65t sound is excellent, far surpassing what I was used to.  That said, I have not used wired earbuds in years, so I cannot compare sound to wired earbuds. That said, I will never go back to wired, period!

The first time I tried to open the 65t's case I could not! I did a quick google to find that you should hold the sides to open the top (take note of which side the hinge is on). Do not try and use your fingernail or some other object to open the case where the slit is. Sometimes I still have an issue opening it when my hands are sweaty. Not a big deal but something I had to mention.

I have not used the phone features, other than I did try it, and it works. I hardly ever do voice ;)

For workouts,they stay put, they do not loosen up, and they do not fall out. That said, when I start working up a sweat, it sort of feels like they are coming lose, but they are not.  Also, big plus, no sweat ends up in my ears like it did with the Epic2's!

The HearThrough feature is a cool feature but not perfect. The HearThrough volume is set in the app and that is where it stays.  I have it set to max volume. If you have the music at a low level, you can hear others conversations near by.  However, turning up the music does not turn up the ambient sound, and you can't hear much.  That said, I did hear a car go by, so it's not terrible. There is an option to have the music pause or keep playing when you activate HearThrough, if you are going to use HearThrough mostly to talk to others, you might want to have it pause the music (or else you are going to have to turn the music volume down). The HearThrough volume is controlled only in the app, it does not go up with the music volume which I wish it did.

The Android app equalizer works pretty well. I am not sure why some people have said it's not.

As I really only use these for working out I have not gone beyond an hour, so cannot comment on battery life.

Overall I am pleased with the Jabra Elite Active 65t's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love them and use them all the time. The required apps to install a little funky at first but after your initial setup they never really require any interaction. The case that acts as a charging station is very sturdy and well built. I've carried it in bags and pockets and it shows no signs of wear.

The headsets themselves are comfortable and sound amazing. I've experienced zero lag when watching movies and love the on ear buttons. The sound cancellation works well and the pass through is useful. Microphone quality is top tier so much so that I can switch between my handset and this earbuds without the other caller having any clue.

My only real complaint is the battery life is a bit lower then expected. Typically with a fully charged case and headsets I can only make about 9-10 total hours. This isn't a deal breaker for me since I typically only use them in small bursts throughout a day, but heavy users should expect to charge these at minimum every night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I figured since these are pretty expensive headphones and a investment I would.
The pros are there wireless, they stay in your ears and they somewhat cancel noise.
As far as noise cancelling goes it's almost as if you're sticking your pinky fingers in your ears while listening to music it's good if someone's talking to you in the room or round you in the room you can drown them out with your music. But if you're in the gym and you're lifting you can still make out the klink's and clanks of people around you.
The music quality and sound isn't exactly ideal if you're a big music junkie and if you like to listen to music really loud that needs headphones aren't for you,but the overall sound quality is decent. They do stay in your ears, but every now and again you can feel them start to come loose and have to push them back in... not a make-or-break. When you order these headphones it comes with a two-year warranty you can sign up for so people saying that the batteries don't last or this or that the two year warranty should cover it.
as far as Bluetooth and dropping calls or music I haven't had any bad experiences I've been able to walk across the gym 60 + feet and still come back and my music's playing just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They look discreet and don't stand out. They are comfortable to wear for a long time and they are excellently balanced for not having aptx.

Music is not heavy bass but sound quality is very good. Call quality is top notch and noise canceling features are superb. The Bluetooth 5.0 keeps them attached to my Note 9 at all times.

Music play back, youtube and Netflix play back with out any dropping of words or phrases. It synchronizes with my Note 9 as soon as I take it out of the charging case. The left side is synchronize as soon as I install it in my ear with no loss of synch or dropping.

The earbuds are noise canceling and the hear through feature allows me to hear things going on around me and to talk to people as well.

They quick charge to 1.5 hours of use in 15 minutes. The charge case gives you 10 hours of listening...... Buy these they are the real deal

Which is totally understandable since the mic is so far away from your mouth.

But after about 6 weeks, the right ear bud stopped turning off/going to sleep when it was returned to case.  One of the main attractions to these wireless earbuds is that they automatically connect when they are removed from the case.  If you have to completely turn them off before you return to the case, well, that defeats the point.

However, didn't get all I had hoped for...

There seem to be various bugs that cause you to need to 'reboot' the earbuds OFTEN by putting them back in the case for just a moment then they work again - until it happens again.  Sometimes several times a day.  Common moments of pressing Right button or pulling out one earbud to pause, then sticking it back in and it wouldn't play in one or both sides.  Not consistently but often.  However, the one I can recreate over and over is with the left earbud's Forward/ Reverse Track button, it does NOT work! It keeps playing the same track, press again, it stops and requires you to reboot the earbud by putting it back in the case.  Not convenient in the middle of a bike ride.  The volume up/down does work so that's good.

These bugs happened with my original purchase and the earbud they warrantied!  Maybe it depends on the music app but seems odd it would; I use Amazon, Pandora, Podcasts, Audible, etc.  All the same result.

Jabra's customer service experience left much to be desired.  12/3 after over an hour on hold, instead initiated online request taking 7 days to get a response. Had to email them 2x over the next 10 days to get a response with a link to the warranty form. Completed but no auto response was sent so waited another 7 days, still nothing. Called to find out if even was received/accepted, etc. holding for 30 minutes and was told it was in the queue and would process right then.  I started the ticket on 12/3 and got the replacement 1/9 which seems was mostly due to lack of response.  However, maybe there are so many problems with their products, they are just that busy.

In general, the sound quality is pretty good, but for the money and the number of problems with product and customer service, I wish I would have gone with the Bose SoundSport earbud for a little more money - they may look big but the sound is WAY better too.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The tips for the ear buds come in three sizes. Try each one because only one is a perfect fit! Once I found my true fit they proved to be very comfortable and stay in my ear for as long as I choose. I wear mine for several hours at a time.
With the use of the chargeable case I get about 15 hours of use.
I've used Beats, Sennheiser and Bose. I have to say that these Jabra earphones are my favorites. The sound quality is great and can be further fine-tuned with the help of the JABRA APP!
Update:
I reviewed these earbuds too quickly! About 3 weeks ago, I noticed that the volume in the right earbud started fading. I went on line and was shocked to find that this was a very common problem with this brand. The volume is now nonexistent in the right. Since the left cannot be used alone, I have to shove them both in my ear to use them, with no sound coming out of the right.
I notified Jabra and they gave me troubleshooting directions, which I followed, even though I had already done them from on line tips. It still did not work. I filled out my warranty for replacement of the right earbud, and it's been about a week  I have not heard a thing!
I will contact them again but will definitely be going back to Sennheiser. I have not tried their True wireless yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_313?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=313&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was looking for a wireless in-ear headphone and had narrowed it down to the AirPods, these, and the Bose SoundSport Free. I initially purchased AirPods and wanted to like them. I really wanted to join the craze of people with little white pods hanging from their ears, but they couldn’t keep up. Every run I went for, the left one would fall out. Maybe it’s me! Maybe I have weird ear canals, but the only solution was to purchase third party covers and have to put them on before each use and remove them before putting them back in the case. I ordered these and returned the AirPods. Hands down, better quality. Sound quality - amazing. I have Sonos speakers in my home and value sound quality, these do NOT fall flat. I love that the case is sturdy. You have to squeeze the sides for the top flap to open so there’s no chance of these headphones rolling out and being lost. The app that accompanies the headphones is a nice addition, but rarely used. The HearThrough option is convenient, but not used often. It’s nice that you have so many options with the buttons on the headphones. Other reviewers mention it being uncomfortable having to hold down the volume rocker to skip a track, but I don’t mind this at all.

Up until about 6 months it was flawless but after than certain features started failing. Automatic connection/playing when placed in your ear stopped working. In certain places you simply couldn’t hear from both earbuds at the same time and had to only have the right one in. Even when an audio jack is connected and the ear buds were in their case stored away it would play the audio to the earbuds instead of the jack like if they were still connected. As a reasonable person I contacted their customer service to see what the problem might be or to get a replacement/repair. Safe to say it’s been over a month since I’ve contacted them and no word on a repair or replacement shipment eta. The customer service is practically non existent, responses take more than a week with some even getting ignored only for the same subject to be addressed next time you get a response like they didn’t read your last 2 emails. No communication whatsoever. If they sent you a replacement, place a hold on your account, then take it off once they get your broken buds like Apple does, it wouldn’t be a big deal. For all the music addicts out there who need it for their commutes, workouts, daily activities and whatnot, you know how much it sucks to be without something other than your phone speaker for a while and it’s really topped off by a careless customer service.

Surprised at the negative reviews -- after several months I haven't had any issues. I previously owned the Google Pixel buds (stolen, sadly). Those are a similar price point, but these are imho _much_ better. Comparatively, they stay in better, block out noise better, and have better sound quality. I don't generally use the mic so no comment on that. My favorite feature is one I didn't ask for -- the way the music auto-pauses when pulling the earbud out -- I don't think I could buy another pair of headphones that did not do this. Charging case works well, I don't have any issues with fit. I use them with my a Pixel 2 phone and have had no issues -- never had to re-pair, fix connection, etc. I generally use them for working out, or to focus at work.

Not Jabra's fault!

Pros:

* quick and easy Bluetooth connectivity
* robust connection
* decent range (I carry my iPhone in my pocket, am 6'/1.8m tall) and never have any loss of signal
* battery life beyond my needs (approx. 2 hrs/session)
* easy interoperability with Siri
* microphone and earphone functions support telephone conversations quite satisfactorily
* Jabra app helpful to adapt to changing ambient environments

Cons:

* don't fit comfortably in my ears - have to ""twist and lock"" occasionally
* ergonomics of case are awkward, ""popping"" the top sometimes causes the buds to fly out and hit the floor
* attractive to Airedale Terriers! :)

I have, or have had, Hear Ones, IQ Buds (both F35 and Q83 ""Boost""), the aforementioned 65t non-Active, and Fflat5 Arias, all of which cost more than the Jabras (a lot more, since I tend to buy the newest and greatest, rather than wait till the market sets a price for them), and the fact that I use the Jabras most often for the early a.m. dog walk speaks for itself.

I thought I needed better tips, so bought the newly-released Comply tips for these.  They have made a marginal difference, but I'm still more confident wearing the IQ Buds, or the Hear Ones (no longer in business) from a stable insertion standpoint.

I definitely would NOT use them for running or a high-energy gym workout - I am sticking with the Jaybird Freedoms for those applications.  Even with the better-fitting wireless earbuds, I don't feel confident that they'll stay put during a strenuous cardio interval, or even doing free weights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For one if the earpieces are slightly off axis to each other the music will stop because the software will think you removed one of the headphones which activates the pause music music function. This got old really quick specially when working out when you have to stop your exercise to fix the allignment issue. The other deal breaker was the battery life for although the case offers extra charging capability I was not able to finish a workout with one charge.

The high volume on these Jabra Elite 65t ear buds is equivalent to the medium volume level on my Skullcandy Titan earbuds.

I go through earbuds at a maddening pace.  I've had expensive and cheap, wireless, corded, and now true wireless.  All earbuds I have previously owned would work great and then the wires would begin to get loose and eventually go in and out and drive me crazy.

This pair fits my ears perfectly and are extremely comfortable.  I was worried they would fall out during my workouts.  But, they stay in nicely and never distract me.

They are easy to use and pairing was super simple.  But my favorite part about them is the pass through feature.  Here is how it works.  The earbuds really shut out the outside world.  If you are wanting to focus on the music, you can do that easily.  But if you want to listen to what is going on around you, you can tap the right earbud and turn on the outside sounds.  It is so cool.  I can walk around and if someone needs my attention, I can listen to them without having to take the earbuds out of my ears.

As I write when I review every pair of earbuds I buy, I will edit this review if they crap out on me prematurely.  Honestly, at this price, these better last a good long while.  But so far, I'm very pleased with them.

**UPDATE**: I have had these over a year and they are still going strong.  I have dropped them a few times and they were not affected.  They still sound great and function flawlessly.  My only complaint is that they do have to be recharged fairly often.  I can go about two and a half hours before they run out of juice.  There are times when I clean and mow grass that I have to switch to other buds while these recharge.  Luckily they recharge pretty quick.  Overall, I am still very pleased with these earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_398?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=398&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The hear through feature is nice, however if your music is up too loud it’s kind of pointless because you can’t hear someone over the music anyways. But with this feature on, pausing the music allows you to hear them without having to take the headset off completely which is nice.

Battery life is great given the small size of the earbuds. Having a couple extra charges in the case is a plus and they do charge relatively quickly. I have had Bluetooth headsets before, so I’m used to remembering to charge them/the case.

They are comfortable to wear for long periods of use. When I’m at the gym, I almost forget that I have them on. Wearing a beanie or headband that is a little tight can cause them to push into your ear a little more and be less comfortable, but that’s not really a fault in the design.

The design overall is great as well. They don’t look as pretentious as the Air Pods. They look sleek and refined but still sporty and definitely not too bulky.

All in all, definitely worth the money if you use your headsets a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The lowest marks possible for calls.","Update - These are the most wonderful wireless earbuds ever!  Awesome fit, comfortable for long periods, terrific sound!!  However and this is HUGE.  On phone calls the mic picks up every noise and amplifies it.  it is so distracting those on the other end of the phone demand I switch off the earbuds.  I cannot even wear in my quiet office because key strokes are so loud when I am on a call.  So disappointing.  Long ago gave up trying to use traveling in the airport.  Related to using during exercising.  When my wife calls she wont stay on the line while I am on the treadmill or other equipment.  Cannot ride my bide and take a call for same ambient noise levels.  But the sound listening to music is awesome while exercising.  So in summary, for all uses besides calling these are awesome and worth every penny.  Just beware for call.

Really solid item.  Excellent for exercising, running or cycling.  Fit secure and have good noise cancelling on my end.  Very comfortable for prolonged use.  Downside taking review down is those on the other end during calls.  Worthless earbuds when using in public.  Those on other end of phone say the ambient sound is louder than my voice and picks up everything.  To the point they have to monitor their volume control and turn down volume during calls.  Just no ambient noise filtering or cancellation for those you call. I travel a great deal and worthless for this application unless I find a quiet corner.  Have adjusted settings on app.  Reviewed Internet for solutions including Jabra site.  Nothing has helped.  Go for it if you don’t use for calls much in public.  If I could get my money back I would as my primary reason to purchase is handsfree traveling without wires.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is great, and the companion app has an equalizer.
  They are very comfortable and fit snugly in my ear. the material feels smooth, and there is no problem with it feeling cold after being in the case. Sometimes my ear gets itchy after using them for a long time, but that happens with all earbuds.
  The buttons are easy to press and the fact that they are physical buttons means no accidental pressing. The controls are simple and easy to learn, and I like the fact that the music pauses when you take a bud out of your ear. A feature I love is Hearthrough. By pressing the right button twice, I can hear what is going on around me. My hearing is slightly poor, and I actually find it easier to hear people when using Hearthrough versus without earbuds.
  The connection is great. The earbuds connect as soon as you take the right earbud out of the case, and I have had no connectivity problems.
  My only complaint is the case. It is difficult to open, as you have to press on the lid to open it. It feels very clumsy compared to the magnetic lids of most true wireless earbuds.
  My earbuds have never run out of battery, even though I use them very much. I simply plug the case in nightly, and never have to worry about battery.
  Overall, these are the best earbuds I have ever had, true wireless or not. I highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything was great for the first 3 months. Then, as soon as my return window and support window expired, the left earbud stopped working and now there is a chirping noise when I return the buds to their case.

The Jabra Support site is pretty sparse, and there wasn't any documentation about the chirping. I opened a Jabra support ticket yesterday morning and so far (almost 36 hours later) I still haven't even received an initial support response. Would not buy again because these are even more expensive than Apple AirPods, but the post-sale support is pretty bad considering the cost of the item.

I may update this review in the future as my support issue progresses, depending on if I ever hear back from Jabra and if they help me with my issue.

DECEMBER 2018 UPDATE:
Jabra finally sent me a replacement pair of headphones, and I haven't heard the chirping yet on the new ones. I hope it doesn't come back. I bumped it up one star (from 2 to 3) because they honored their warranty, but the support team was slow and not super helpful. It took over a week to even get a warranty *request* initiated with the support ticket.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had been looking for noise-isolating earbuds with the seamless connectivity of the AirPods and had struck out a few times. I owned—and ultimately returned—the previous model of these, the Jabra Elite Sport, because they wouldn’t let me connect to multiple devices. Every time I wanted to switch between my computer and my phone/tablet, I had to re-pair the earbuds. Every time. That got old fast. These earbuds switch seamlessly between all of my devices (3: comp, tablet, phone) by simply activating sound for the most recent source. Then there was the issue of wearability. My ears would start to hurt with the Elite Sport after about an hour or so. I worn these for hours at a time and don’t even feel them.

This model addressed every issue I had with the old one. Although I tend to have to switch out cushions with noise-isolating earbuds, the way these fit into my ear was perfect out of the box. The also lock into my ears effortlessly, so I no longer have to pull on my earlobes in weird ways to get them to plug my ear and block out noise.

Battery life is fantastic. I’ve worn them for 3-4 hours straight and they still have juice in them when I’ve checked. I haven’t needed to use the case to do an emergency charge because they’ve died on me in the middle of something, which was one of my fears when switching to battery-operated buds vs. wired buds.

Last thing I’ll mention is range. Without realizing it, I just walked away from my tablet to what was easily 50-75 ft away and the music never stopped. Great earbuds, totally worth trying if you’re looking to go wireless without sacrificing any of the “advantages” of wired headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_405?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=405&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did not expect to like these earbuds as much as I did. I thought it would be OK, but my gosh, I've converted. I do not plan to go back to wired headphones after picking these up. Great comfort - the buds stay in the ear effortlessly through even vigorous exercise.

But, it does go DOWNHILL.

The Bad:
My left earbud is basically a useless piece of plastic now, after only 6 weeks of ownership. No water damage or hard drops or anything. It seems to be a bad solder - the speaker only plays when I physically squeeze the earbud housing.

As much as I love this product, it's simply not cool that it was built so cheaply. I'd encourage avoiding the device until they sort out their durability standards.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got these for Christmas and while using it, I noticed that it would just randomly cut in connection, even when my phone is right next to them. While this isn't usually a problem for me, these earbuds just would always fall out whenever I slightly shake my head, which always gives me a small heart attack from the fear of dropping it behind a car seat or something. After less than a month, the right earbud stopped working, and because the way the earbuds work, you can't use the left one without the right. So after waiting for nearly 3 months and multiple phone calls, I got my replacement, but between the long wait time and just the horrible connection quality, I just put them back into my junk drawer and continued to use the wired Sony earbuds that have treated me much better. Even though I'm sick of apple and their overpriced products, I know they at least can deliver a quality product at a similar price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_275?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=275&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Biggest drawback I felt is that the left bud doesnt have mic, however in airpod you can use left or right to answer calls.
Rarely the person hears echo of his own voice while Im on Jabra earbud, something which the company must rectify!
Rarely, the earbud receives call with full distortion, I have to swap it to mobile audio and back to get it fine, strange!
The above rarely would be like once or twice in 30 calls.
Pros:
Amazing battery life, quick charging.
Clear and crisp audio, good noise cancellation, other person dont recognize if Im on earbud or not.
Can connect to 2 devices at time, so I can watch video on laptop and listen audio in my mobile, useful.
Fits perfectly into ear.

I still use my AirPods for conference calls ...","I purchase the 65t’s from Jabra direct and have had for almost two months.  I own Apple AirPods and have tried the Anker Zolo Liberty + through Kickstarter.  Overall for the price and sound, the Jabra’s are the best.

I still use my AirPods for conference calls as I can still hear the outside world easily, but the sound for music is much better with the Jabra’s. Just make sure you have the right earbud piece on or a tight seal as this will give you better bass response and over all a better sound.  Also, I found them to get better with about 10 hours of burn in or use.

Of all the wireless earbuds - The B&O are the best sounding...unfortunately, the constant dropout of the left earbud every 10 minutes become annoying and is a problem with them as the left is a slave to the right earbud - if they fix this, then the B&O.  The Anker Zolo's while nice - the left earbud died and I was refunded.

Over all I liked the Jabra's and the trick is a good tight fit in the ear.  Otherwise I still would go Apple AirPods if you also really use them for phone conversations. (FYI - The Jabra's are very good for phone conversations - just need to dial them in on the app).

I work out almost everyday, use them at work, and enjoy carpentry, and they work well in all scenarios. They only have a 4hr battery life, but the case will charge them in transit *fast*. The battery life has never been an issue in the past 5mo.

Likes
=====
-Audio quality
-Range: seriously, the range is sick. My gym is in my basement and I was listening to music after a workout, walked up three flights of stairs, and only then did I realize I left my phone in the basement and the headphones were STILL CONNECTED AND STREAMING
-The Hear Through feature: I don't think I'll ever buy another pair of headphones without this feature
-build quality: I've dropped them several times outside of the case and they're still going strong

Dislikes
======
-case's latching mechanism isn't super, so it's conceivable they could fall out

Initially I was unimpressed, but after swapping in the large ear flanges, I got a really good seal (surprisingly because the posts are pretty short so they don't go far in) and all of a sudden there was the bass. Because they seal without going as far in to the ear, they're also really comfortable. I'd almost say I could forget I'm wearing them. I've had them a week so far. I've made many calls (admittedly all from indoors -- haven't tried a windy location yet) and callers say I'm very clear. Calls come through in both ears.
The UI is well thought out; the buttons all work as they should, and are pretty logical. Google Assistant worked first try too. The Hear Through mode is very useful.
The only thing I can say that's not totally positive is they're a little hard to get out of the case because they're light and beveled and a bit slippery. Some grip around the back would be useful. But that's very minor and I got used to it quickly.

The issue is that if you wear them tightly you completely lose volume and bass (I suppose they are designed to use part of the inner ear chamber as a woofer/resonance chamber) and the noise cancelling effect ends up distorting the sound, to the point that you almost don't ear any music and/or you hear an extremely bad echo. You can avoid that by wearing the buds loosely but they will move and fall off while you workout, so being this WORKOUT BUDS the issue completely defeats the purpose. If your idea of workout is sitting still on a bench admiring the girls these earbuds are definitely the product for you, in all other instances, avoid like the plague. Returned after 2 workout sessions (with 2 different sizes of plug to see if the issue went away - it didn't).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They worked great and I loved them. That lasted for about 2 weeks. The left earbud stopped pairing with the right and works maybe 1 out of 50 times. I called customer support the day it stopped pairing and they sent me an RMA. Unfortunately, I left the country a couple days later and wasn't able to get around to sending the earbuds in to get replaced until about a month after the fact. The RMA slip had expired by that point which was expected so no issue. I tried emailing and calling to get another RMA sent out but never heard back. So, I decided to live with the fact that the left earbud doesn't work 90% of the time. Then a couple weeks ago I finally decided to try again and get a new RMA. I spoke with tech support and gave them my case number. The guy told me he was going to send out my RMA the next day. So, I was like okay cool, sounds good. It has now been 2 weeks and I have not received any RMA.....I'm currently on hold trying to get a hold of tech support. I decided to write this review while I wait. So, like the headline says. The earbuds are great when they actually work. However, I am giving the product a 1 star review due to poor customer service and the fact that the product stopped working properly a couple weeks after purchasing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are incredibly comfortable and won't budge during my workouts or runs. These buds tuck nicely into its oval shaped charging case, which stores the pods in between my workouts and keeps them from getting lost. I find that the charging pod case is extremely hard to open. Actually, you have to squeeze and open the case at the same time to lift the lid to get it open. Love the google assistant feature as well. These buds can last 5 hours on their own and then an additional 10 hours if they are charged up in between workouts. ( Much longer than my Apple earpods. )

You can find other less expensive wireless bluetooth earphones, but the alternatives either aren't sweat resistant for workouts, or don't fit as well.

Prior to buying them, I looked at so many online reviews trying to decide what wireless headphones would be the best. I was down to my top 2 - Bose Soundsport Free Wireless and the Jabra Elite Active. I ordered both and really was leaning towards Bose. I am the owner of the Bose Soundsport II and wow, those headphones are amazing. I really thought Bose would offer me just as good experience with the soundsport free headphones and boy oh boy I was so wrong. I read reviews about how they stuck out of your ears and man, they weren't even kidding. Those headphones were huge! Jabra in comparison was amazing. They are small enough that they don't stick out of your ears. I've used these headphones while walking around in my neighborhood talking with my mom and people have looked at me like I was crazy...they thought I talking to myself because these Jabra headphones are so small that they weren't noticed! Furthermore these Jabra headphones come with EXTRA features, which I didn't even realize existed! They have an active mode, focus mode where you can let background noise in or filter them out. There's definitely a difference. Furthermore, they come with preset soothing ambience sounds that you can play while trying to do work. Do they fall out of your ears? NO! It has not happened yet. One final thing I love - ability to connect to more than one device! I just realized a few days ago, I can pair my Jabra headphones with my phone and iPad. This ability has made life so much easier since I don't have to switch between devices everytime. I have not noticed any lagging with videos, listening to music. The sound quality is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I liked it so much I bought the active as a backup. At first the sound was good, connectivity was good, Sound+ app was good. I don't know how it became so terrible in the end. Below, I'm going to compare ""before"" and ""after"", which points to when I first received the headphones and now.

Before:
Headphones connectivity was good, even on the bus where everybody was listening to some kind of device.

Jabra  Sound+ app had lots of configurations to mess with. Two thing I actually used were hear through and auto stop when headphones are taken out. I disabled it so I can give a headphone to a friend right next to me and both of us can listen

After:
Headphones disconnect for no reason. Sometimes when I'm facing a certain way, othertimes it just disconnects every 15 seconds for 5 seconds and then come back. This can happen anywhere and doesn't matter whether how close the phone is.

The sound app features are gone. The auto stop is no longer possible. The detection is made by range of one ear piece with another so you would have to be cheek against cheek against someone if you want to share the headphones. Worse yet, I can't tell if the headphones's intermittent stopping is related to this feature is not since I can no longer control it.

Worse yet, the headphones are really bad. It can't hear you while in your ear so sometimes I have to take out the right ear piece and use it as a microphone. However, thanks to the removal of the autostop, the headphones will turn off whatever I'm doing.

Jabra, fix your firmware. It's easy, just revert your codebase. Whoever is making updates is making retrogrades.

I work in a restaurant and a warehouse, and these headphones were constantly exposed to oily environments and I have dropped than more than a few times and they still hold up. Don't let the plastic housing fool you, these things are strong and only suffered 1 minor scratch.
Even now the battery life still goes up to 5 hours on a full charge and ~3 hours with hear-through mode on. I have noticed though that it takes longer to charge, ~10min longer compared to when I originally bought it.
I'm no audiophile but the sound quality was good enough for me. Currently, sometimes the left bud produces some background static which is annoying but nothing a hard reset can't fix and overall I'm glad they provided an accompanying app with a equalizer even though to me its basicly useless. The mic picks up a lot of background sound but is able to clearly pick up my voice when I talk and the proximity to your phone/device while in use is managable at 30 ft without any obstructions, otherwise, it's nearly impossible to use it in the house with a wall or two blocking the signal and you will most likely have to have it on your person. The hear-through mode and the ability to activate the google assistant via long press on the right bud is honestly my favorite feature and reason to would recommend it to others and give this 5 stars. It allows me to be hands free from distractions while driving, hear co-workers, listen to announcements on the bus/subway without stopping my music.
Overall great for the average commuter and fantasticly long lasting product.

This product is way better than the price.  To start, the headphones are loud and comfortable. It was a bit awkward to put in at first but you get use to it by the 2nd-3rd time. They do not fall out of my ears. They work decent with phone calls (7/10 calls are clear on the first try without reconnecting or constant “hello??s”) The app works wonders in having personal sound settings.

If I happen to receive a phone call while my earbuds are in the charging case in my pocket, then I am extremely frustrated when the person I'm attempting to speak to cannot hear me and vice-versa. It's only after a few seconds that I realize this mistake has a occurred and I have to switch the audio control _back_ to the handset, but by that time they've already hung up, thinking the connection was bad.

I know these are active so expect they would do well with sweat, rain that type of environment.

Today I got stuck in a downpour, puddles in minutes. The right bud fell out into a puddle, was pushed against the edge of the lawn and it took 3-5 minutes to find.

It was in about 2 inches of water for that long. I thought for sure they were done.

I wiped it off and let it sit for an hour. Figured I would give it a shot.

They turned right on, connected and sound perfect and calls remain clear.

Worth every penny. Thank you Jabra, job well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_329?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=329&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Once the seal was made there was plenty of bass response.  They almost always felt like they were going to fall out, and in fact they did on a few occasions .  Its surprising that a neck lanyard wasn't included.  The bluetooth link was constantly being dropped.  I know that all bluetooth devices suffer from this, but it was excessive, several time a song.  The sound quality was acceptable, especially when a good seal was made.  The volume buttons on the left bud were a little hard to use, the right off and on were okay.

I did so much research before I purchased, the most expensive headphones I have gotten. And overall I am ok with them, they are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent with great noise canceling. However.

The range is very low. My phone must be within six feet of my headphones for them to connect. I can no longer leave my phone in one spot in the gym and do my various lifts :( I had to get an arm band to keep my phone with me, thus kinda defeating the purpose of bluetooth.

They also fell out of my ears on my second run. Now that is the only time they fell. I am 5""9' and they fell onto concrete and only have a little scratch to show for it, so they are durable. But I am now pretty vigilant to press on them regularly to make sure they are staying in now.

On a side note, as long as they are close together they work with only one in. I am deaf in one ear and this is wonderful for me. One in my pocket, one in my ear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you don't mind spending lot's of money on trash, they're really not bad.

They fit a bit snugger than say the AirPods, if that's what you're looking for. But beware, they fit a bit snug, and my experience became a nuisance trying to exercise with bulky plastic rubbing against my ears.

The connectivity was pretty decent, but I had a hard time pairing it without the use of their app. Wow, so cool that they have an app just for the earphones? No, it just adds another step to what should be very simple.

The sound quality was alright. Like yeah, it sounds pretty clear, but it's 2019, what headphones don't sound clear? If you're going to drop some money on earphone sound quality, this isn't quite spectacular.

Pros & Cons:
 Look 5/5- then look amazing
 Fit 4/5 - over fit well but dig in to the ears when using adjustments
 Sound 4/5 - Excellent sound
 Charging Case 3.5/5 - overall nice but a bit fat and no magnets means then fall out sometimes
 Controls 2/5 - with only volume and track selection on the left ear means when only listen to the right you don't have controls.  BIG bummer.  When you change the volume it digs the earbud in your ears, super uncomfortable.
  Pairing 3/5 - too many times the left wouldn't engage and had to put back in the case then back to my ears then would be ok, but that is not acceptable.  (that is whats nice about the airpods, they just work)
  Usability - 2/5 - because of the controls and because you can't use the left by itself.

If you can overlook those flaws they are great earbuds, just not for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They look good, feel good, and stay in your ears good. Also good noise cancelling, but if you need to be aware of your surroundings the HearThrough feature picks up the environment and plays the audio into your headphones.

Battery life is 5 hours which is hard to get used to coming off of the Powerbeats 3 which was 12 hours, but the case holds 2 full recharges. Sound is okay, nothing wowing but solid. Phone calls are amazing, again coming from the Powerbeats that microphone was horrible for talking. Not at all an issue with these Jabras.

My biggest complaint about these headphones may be a small one for others: it has very clear audio latency issues when watching videos. The sound does not match up with what you are watching, it’s probably due to the fact the headphones are cableless so they take longer to sync with each other and the phone.

That said it’s a real minor issue and what you are getting out of it is a truly wireless experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_277?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=277&reviewerType=all_reviews"

3) I could opt to only use one during my normal day for phone calls

What has my experience been, relative to my expectation?
1) THe sound quality is not nearly as good as any of my wired earbuds. The lows are almost non-existent
2) THey are comfortable and fit well, especially during the bike rides. For phone audio, they are great
3) When I use only one, my call recipients complain that there is an odd ""feedback"". Once I activate the second one, no one complains.

The left only connects to the right earbud so if that right earbud isn't in your ear, the left WILL NOT WORK. Not to mention since I only use the right bud, I lost it at work being it was the only bud I used. That means I have a case with a useless left earbud. I went to see how much it would cost to buy another right earbud to discover you can only buy BOTH BUDS AS REPLACEMENTS. The only thing I really enjoyed from the ear buds was how long the battery life was. Other than that, I'd go with something different. Maybe spend alittle more for those Pro Beats.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_404?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=404&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I loved that they could support two bluetooth devices at once so that I could easily transtion from my phone to a tablet.  And the audio pass through was handier than I expected.  My problem though was that I was one of the unlucky ones who seemed to be between sizes on the ear tips.  One size was big enough to be a bit painful, while the next size down would keep losing its seal, which lead to bad sound and the earpiece becoming loose in my ear.  I'm dissapointed that they couldn't inlcude more than three sizes.  I've bought cheap $20 headphones that come with a whole bag full of different ear tips.  Sadly I had to return them because without a good fit they just wouldn't work right (ironically, even the inside of the packaging makes some remark about great sound starting with a great fit).  I even tried ear tips from some other headphones I had but the Jabra ones are much shallower than usual, so they wouldn't work.  Here's hoping Jabra can provide some better ear tip options on their future products because I thought the rest of the design was great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm writing this review too after just putting them through a cycle in the washer and maybe 2 minutes in the dryer, and I'm experiencing no difficulties whatsoever. I thought for sure I destroyed them but they still work and charge. The only small cons I have are the fit sometimes when working out and the controls. If you smile or tighten your face in some way, they tend to slip out just a tiny bit. To control the volume, the front of the left bud is down and back is up. Also I had a problem getting the alaexa to work, which was just more to test, I won't really use it. But to have the comfort of no wires, great sound, and ease of use they deserve the 5 stars. Also a trick with the charging case, which is slightly annoying to open, if you press more so on the left or right side of the front to push open, it'll be easier than pushing directly in the middle or with two thumbs","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far, out of all the earbuds I've tried, these had the best call quality which is what i based my purchase on. My biggest thing was that if I was working out and happened to get a call, I could take the call without having to go through steps to turn off Bluetooth to answer the call. So for the call quality checkbox, it's positive! I'll sum up my impressions as follows:

PROS:
Great call quality
Great sound quality
Good price for all the features you get
They paired very easily and every time i took them out of the case.
Case was small, compact and inconspicuous like the iPod case
Convenient button on the earbuds to hang-up or answer calls

So-So qualities:
Volume control on buttons was not as smooth. In other words, you had to ensure you held the earbud in your ear (because it's a little big and awkward) to turn the volume up or down.

Micro USB charging vs. USB-C. This was really not that big of a deal for me since I have numerous cables lying around the house for both. However, given that I have the Galaxy Note 8 which is USB-C, it would've been nice to only have to carry around 1 cable.

The different soundscapes were nice. (I used the rainy day a lot for focus and concentration). But I really didn't have to have that feature embedded in the software because I could've downloaded a program to do the same thing.

Active Noise Cancelling - this was okay. When I was in a busy grocery store talking with a friend, they could hear noises in the background but could still hear me fine.

You can use only 1 earbud at a time; however, it can only be the right earbud which is the master. You can't use the left earbud by itself.

CONS:
No magnets in the case to hold the earbuds securely. This was a big deal for me. You had to be careful when you opened the case because of the possibility of the earbuds popping out of the case. No bueno!

They are a little on the large side and did not securely stay in my ear. I kept getting the feeling that they were slipping out of my ear. Therefore, I had to keep shoving them back in which really sealed my ear like i had pushed earplugs in really deep. Not comfortable at all. And this happened with all the different sizes of buds they had to offer. None of them provided that secure fit over time. I've tried less expensive earbuds, like the MPOW which had a real nice fit, but unfortunately the call quality was trash.

If the case was magnetic and the earbuds were made a little more ergonomically to fit in your ear securely, I would have definitely kept these headphones. The other thing is independent earbud use. It would be nice to be able to use the left earbud independent of the right.  Hopefully, they can improve on this in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_318?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=318&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not so with these Jabra Elites.
I use these at the gym, so durability is important. They have a two-year warranty against sweat. Since I am listening to music, sound quality is also important, and fortunately these have great music quality. They ship with three different sized ear-buds which is important because have an effective seal in the ear canal is everything. If the buds don’t make an effective seal, the bass suffers. The downloadable software includes it own equalizer. This is great because I can set an EQ setting specific for the Jabra earbuds, which allows me to leave my primary Spotify EQ untouched on the setting I use it for outside the gym.
The buds fit snugly and stay in place while exercising. When I’m done, I return them to the case where they start charging back up. Jabra claims a 5-hour battery life on the buds themselves, with the case adding an additional 10 hours. Having the case double as an external battery is brilliant. I would rather re-charge the case periodically and have it keep the earbuds charged rather than having a low-charge warning beep in my ears throughout a workout. I also love the fact that when I remove the buds from the charging case they automatically turn on, and they automatically turn off when I return them to the case. It’s just super convenient.
These aren’t cheap – but if you want great sound, durability, and convenience, these are a great sound solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_414?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=414&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I then visited my chiropractor, who adjusted my neck and it would feel fine until that next night of sleep.  I went to a massage therapist and their therapy seemed to work, until the next night of sleep.  I then began to realize that maybe it was these ear pieces, and I stopped wearing them so often.

While the sound is good, and the app allows for customization in that regard, the Sound+ app looses connection with the 65t when switching the headset back after connecting to a 2nd device. Also, anyone looking to use these independently as a single earpiece for phone calls on your left ear must look elsewhere. The 65t's have to be used in tandem, and from what I can tell, the left is slave to the right. This is not an issue if you're a right-ear dominant, but I'm a leftie. I would have added a star if the comfort was pristine, but after just a couple hours in a coffeeshop with these things in, my ears were begging to be released from the agonizing strain caused by the silicone buds.

I like many features of the product, but the primary reason I bought them was for running. These earphones produce a loud, dull sound sensation in my ears with every step I take. This is okay when I am static or lifting weights in the gym. However, it's unbearable when I run in the treadmill or outdoors. All I hear is BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM... This sound is loud and imposible to ignore. It FULLY drowns the music if you are running at a middle or fast pace.
If you are thinking of buying the earphones for running, DON'T. You'll regret it and feel frustrated.
I'm back to my SHURE earphones for running, with wire and all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Bluetooth connection has been perfect with my iPhone and my Apple Watch. They also work fairly well with Siri. It’s awesome to go on a 40-minute run with nothing but my clothes, my watch, and my ear buds. No wires! I love it.
I compared with my brother’s AirPods, but I needed to use EarBuddyz to keep them in my ears. It just wasn’t worth the hassle in the end. I like being able to take them out of their case, put them straight into my ears, and put them back into their case. It’s the best.

I previously purchased a “Used - Very Good” pair, but they had the Bluetooth connection issues described in other comments. The earbuds only worked if in a direct line of sight of the right earbud.
I went for a walk and if I put my phone in a pocket, I immediately lost connection. I had to hold the phone in front of my, or hold it specifically in my right hand. Even when holding it in front of me to type a text or select a new song, I lost connection if I turned my head to the right!
That was ridiculous. The headphones are comepletely worthless if the Bluetooth connection is so easily disrupted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 -best Bluetooth connectivity

 -great noise-isolation & cancelation
 -intuitive app features, including GPS tracking and equalizer

Cons:
 -no magnets, falls out of case easily
 -uses micro-usb rather than usb-c

Verdict:
 Don’t waste your time with any other TW pair on the market, as I’ve purchased and tried nearly every flagship pair and have been sorely disappointed with at least one of their qualities. The Elites score well in every single category, which you will certainly not find with any other pair. Sound quality is very impressive, coming second only to the $300 Sennheiser TW Momentum.

For active use: buy from Jabra
For the audiophiles: get Sennheiser","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was really hoping these would be as good as a lot of the reviews I read but they are not. These are far from what I would consider a premium pair of wireless earbuds. Airpods are almost perfect except that they are hard plastic. If apple would only convert them to soft and sealing rubber tips they would be untouchable.

The Bad. There are a few key issues with these which makes them far below a $180 set of wireless earbuds and nowhere near airpods quality. 1. The left earbud does not operate independently!!!!! WT_? I could not believe this as the $40 set of el cheapo wireless buds I have even do this. Total deal breaker.  2. The button function on the buds, which is programmable via the app, never seem to do what I want them to do and they require a physical press of a button which requires mashing the bud into your ear to get a response instead of using a touch. 3. The connection always produces a good 10-15 seconds of cutting in and out before the signal gets clean the first time I connect. Also, I will occasionally get interference and hear odd noises through them. 4. When you remove an earbud it will often continue to play indicating there is no ear sensing tech or its just really poor. 5. The app to control the earbuds features works spotty at best. It does not always recognize they are connected. The app does nothing until it senses they are connected so this renders the app unreliable and thus unused.

The 65ts are good at a few things: 1. They always connect and connect quickly. Honestly, this is the one thing they do better than airpods because they connect to 2 devices at a time. However, the distance is not great. It's acceptable, not great. 2. They are comfortable and lightweight. They dont look like it but they are.  3. They have good battery life. I would call it about the same as airpods maybe better. But I use the 65ts much less so that could be part of why it seems better. 4. the app contains equalizer settings and a listen through mode which sends sounds through the mic so you can hear through while wearing them.

I used these with my iPhone XS Max and my 2018 iPad Pro and my 2016 Macbook Pro. So my review is based on use with these 3 devices. Also, in comparison to the Airpods I am using the original airpods not the new airpod 2s. As, aside from siri im not aware of any real difference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_268?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=268&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If they took care of the issue in a timely manner I would be happy to recommend these since up to the point that there was an issue they worked great.

The issue I encountered was that after two months the right earbud has started to decrease in volume as soon as I start using to the point where it is inaudible and I have to put in both earbuds but can only hear the left one.

I reached out to Jabra two weeks ago and they got back to me with the standard software resets etc. which I was happy to do but nothing worked. I reached out again but haven't heard back for the past week.

You need to use the Jabra GN app to adjust the eq. The default setting is rather flat and lacking bass definition. I adjusted that in the app and the sound was much better. They have a lot of well thought out features and are really easy to use.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and they are great for that. I love that they turn on automatically when I take them out of the case and automatically pair with my ipod. I made a phone call with just the right ear piece in and the phone call sounded really good. These are the type of earbuds that fit snugly in the ear canal. I find that after a few hours this type of earbud becomes uncomfortable so not something to use all day while working. This type of earbud also blocks out outside noises so you can't really hear if someone comes up and talks to you. Jabra thought of this and has a ""hearthrough"" mix feature that pulls sounds from the room into the ear pieces sorta like a hearing aid. Very cool if you want to hear what is going on around you sometimes. What is really cool is that when you take one of the earbuds out of your ear, the playback stops and then starts up when you put the earbud back in your ear. A really cool feature.

I also really like that the case/charger will recharge the earbuds a few times even when not plugged into USB. I used them outside and had no connectivity issues so these are great for doing yardwork or chores around the house.

They stay snug in the ear so a good option for using at the gym.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros
1.) The highs and mids sound great.  Not the best for base.
2.) The noise cancelng is pretty decent. No complaints there.
3.) Good battery life.

Con:
1.) I'm 6'4 and the bluetooth connection is terrible if the phone is in my back pocket.
2.) If you have the headphones more than 8 inches away from each other only the right side plays. The left does not, even if you turn off the feature that pauses the music when you remove one headphone.
3.) They don't stay in my ears.  Gets uncomfortable after a while.
4.) The wind seems to affect the headphones.  Seems crazy but it really does, caused to sound to skip.
5.) The equalizer doesn't really change much.
6.) Customer support blows! It really does, for this price tag, they are just not worth it.
7.) In the year 2000 I could share ear buds with a friend and these 2018 headphones can't do that. Share them with a friend and only the right ear plays.  So annoyed!

Would never recommend these.  Not the headphone or the jabra customer support.  You'll spend  200 bucks after tax, and that's all they care about.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Voice quality during phone calls is amazing, there’s a hear through option, so you can hear outside noise if you want. The app that’s associated with jabra, Is just OK.

While the sound quality on these is better on these, here are several reasons why the Airpods are better:
1) inserting and taking out the Jabra buds into their case is not as smooth as putting the Airpods into their case.  The Airpods just drop right into their case, plus it is easier to know which is the right/left one for their proper slot.  The Jabra buds are loose when they go in, and it is easy to mix up which is the right/left one.  Plus when opening the Jabra case, you have to be careful that the earbuds do not fall out as you open them as they are not securely fit in these.  The Airpods are snug in their case as you just drop them right into their slot.
2)  The battery life on the Jabra case is not as good as the Apple case.  I could go a whole week before having to charge the Apple case.  The Jabra case lasts a few days at most.
3)  When you open the Airpod case, you see the battery life remaining on the charger and each airpod on your iphone right away. For Jabra, you have to open their Sound app. to get battery life remaining.
4) Most annoying, only the right Jabra earbud will work by itself in your ear.  The left Jabra earbud will not work for playing music by itself; you need to have the right earbud in as well.  For me this was a big inconvenience as many times I like to just use one earbud while doing work or whatever.

As I said earlier, the sound is better on the Jabra earbuds and they also block outside noise much better than the Airpods.  The Jabra Sound app has equalizer settings that allows you to adjust treble, bass etc. which you can't do on the Airpods.

Overall though, if you are an Iphone user, the Airpods are I think the better option as they work more seamlessly with iphones.

Update October 2019
Just to give a shout out to Jabra's customer service.  I had a problem with my charging case and  they sent me a replacement case within a week of when I contacted them.  So at the very least you get very responsive customer service with them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Better battery life than other buds I've tried (about 3 hours before they need to go back in their charging case). App works well.

Cons: I couldn't get a good fit without third party foam tips. Old micro-usb port. Volume +/- buttons are reversed. Some skipping noticed.

I really enjoy a good pair of earbuds. I haven't really been particularly happy with anything in about 8 years since the dog got ahold of my favorite (discontinued) pair. I've gone through sets of Apple, Samsung and Bose since and haven't been particularly happy with anything.

As the title states, while my ears look fairly normal (I believe) it is very rare I find a pair of buds that stay sealed in my ear. Additionally I sweat quite a bit and this adds to the problem. I noticed a much better fit with these, however right at the 2 mile mark of a run the left earpiece would slide out and require drying off. While at the gym the left side would again dislodge when I would lie on my back. Jabra's website states the rubber tips in the ""Active"" are anti slip, that hasn't been my experience.

Despite the slippage I was very happy with the sound quality and features so I purchased third party foam tips. These did the trick and I can say they now stay in place. The downside to the foam is that in order for these buds to go back in their charging case I either need to remove the tips or maneuver them in very carefully before closing the lid.

I do have some quibbles in regards to the features. First, no usb-c? Lower priced Samsung earbuds come with this. The left bud has 2 small buttons, the forward one turns volume - while back button is used for volume +/change songs. I feel like these buttons are reversed, forward should be volume up.

I will also say that these earbuds do occasionally 'skip' on me, where others have not. Not frequent but it does happen (Samsung Note 8)

While I did need to purchase foam tips and said tips add a little trouble, once these buds are in place I'm one happy camper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have many earphones, but these are my first Jabra brand earphone. I am switching from Jaybird X3 earbuds which worked very well using Comply foam tips for exercising (mostly runs, but also gym exercises). But I wanted something with no cables for sports and the Jabra Elite Active 65t fit the bill. I very much like these true wireless earbuds, but as with everything there are pros and cons:

Pros:
- I am using the supplied plastic tips and so far they stay in my ear well and have not fallen-out.
- The sound is very good. As expected, not as good as high-end wired earphones - I am comparing them to Etymotic Research ER4XR earphones or Sennheiser 650 headphones, but I did not buy these for high quality audio listening and both of those are far more expensive as well. Still, the sound is very good, so absolutely no complains there.
- The battery life so far has been excellent. I have not charged them once since the first charge, and the case is still charging the earbuds well.
- The bluetooth connection has been solid. I have not had any drops once connected and during workouts. I have even walked far away from my iPhone X, and had no issues.
- Once I figured-out how to open the case, I really love it. It is small so I can keep it in my pocket and putting the earbuds in it is super easy and they charge, turn-on, etc. just as expected.

Cons:
- These are very small earbuds. Even after seeing all the pictures, I was surprised at how small they are. Of course that was a design goal and I do like that they don't stick-out too far when in my ear, and look cool. But the small size means the controls are sometimes hard to work with and you can press the wrong button on the earbud by mistake.
- They are not very comfortable for wearing for a long time (past one hour). I will try different tips, perhaps the Comply foam tips and see if those would help.
- On only one occasion, when I pulled the earbuds out of the case and put them on, the left earbud did not play the music. As stated by others, I put them both back in the case, and then put them back on and they both worked. This has not happened again, so I am not concerned that it's going to be a problem.

I would recommend these for anyone that is looking for true wireless sports earbuds. I was planning to buy the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless and was waiting for more reviews to see how they compare. But they are not designed for sport and are also much more expensive, so I am happy with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_309?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=309&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Despite the cost, and Jabras reputation, the sound quality was so poor as to render these headphones worthless.  The treble was shrill, and there was no bass.  Furthermore, they kept cutting out (I have a Pixil XL which provides a strong signal).  To add insult to injury, I have to pay for my own return shipping for this defective item, and have to hassle with taping multiple hazardous materials warning labels on the shipping box.  Odd, but the box that I received the earbuds in had no such warning labels.  All in all, one of my more unsatisfactory experiences with Amazon, and with Jabra.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are excellent. They've never fallen out of my ears. You need to experiment with the different sized earbud sleeves. I went with the larger size to get the best fit and sound. The different sizes do affect the sound quality. There was one occasion that the left earbud lost its sound and after messing with it I found that that was sweat on the sensor which caused it to quit playing. There are embedded sensors that stops it from playing when pulled away from the ear. So a quick wipe and it worked again. So far the battery life has been really good. I've never had them die on me.

The design of the earbuds are great for my ear. They are comfortable, no pressure to my ears and I think I can wear this for hours. I actually slept with this a few times and did not hurt my ears.
The sound quality is good, it can reduce background noise and enjoy your music. I does not disconnect or lose connection while you are listening and that includes the other pair. Other brand that I had have that problem where the other buds disconnects and it sounds like its having a hiccup that I have to move my head closer to the device.
It has hearthrough which so you dont need to remove them when having a conversation. Even when your audio is paused, you still need to remove them as they do not work properly. You can barely hear a regular conversation and you have to ask the other person to speak louder so its more appropriate to just remove them. The microphone is not the best. It is advertised as great to use on skype but even skype will prompt you that your mic is of low quality. People I talked to in skype prefers my laptop's intergrated mic rather than this device because of the bad background noise it is capturing and its poor quality.
The worse part of it is its case, after 8 months of use, the hinge which is held only by thin weak plastic broke. I use it 3 times a day 3-4 times a week and the device is not abused. The issue is the design. You have to press it inwards to disconnect the lock which bends the upper part of the hinge weakening it everytime you open it. You can search the comments regarding this review section for the same problem. I have read about it did not believe them but should have listened. My thought was it was a matter of abuse and as long as you use it with care, it will be ok. I contacted Jabra support and they determined that it was not covered by warranty since it is ""accidental damage"". Not worth it for $150 earbuds lasting only 8 months. Very disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are a few minor improvements to be made to them:

-The case isn't very secure, light taps and bumps are enough to knock it open.

-On top of that, the headphones sit in the case. There's no magnet or anything holding them in, only gravity. So at a slight tilt, they'd fall out.

-The headphones themselves could be more secure.

I didn't mind spending $170 if the sound quality was superior, but it's not. AND, the REAL reason the Jabras are going back is that they fall out of my ears, notwithstanding trying several of the different silicone earpieces provided...and when you're walking the dog at night and they fall out, how are you going to find them in a pile of leaves? One dropped out of my ear and just missed the toilet (AFTER the fact if you know what I mean). Another time one dropped out and missed going into a sewer. So after a half dozen drop outs since 12/25, I'm ready to call the question. The other problem is that they fail to reliably link to my iPhone X after having been initially paired...so I deleted and then re-downloaded the app and THEN they linked without a problem. But I've done that three (3) times. That's enough. So, regretfully, they're in the box waiting to be walked over to UPS, while I wear my Aukey EP-B40s, which at $29 at Amazon, I can have a red and a black pair and keep one in use and the other charging.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_317?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=317&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My experience has been that once you go over $50, they all sound pretty much the same (this is not true of headphones).  That being said, I purchased these for the wireless feature and they work fine.  However, they don't sound any better than my 10-year old wired Marleys.  Also, to me noise-cancelling is what you get on Bose headphones - you flip that button and the whole world goes quiet and it's done electronically.  Unless I'm missing something, the ""noise-cancelling"" feature on these earbuds comes from the fact that they're essentially an ear-plug.  The noise is reduced but I can still hear some ambient noise.

Overall I am happy with the purchase.  I live near a noisy marina and I bought these so that I could sit on my deck and not have to listen to dance music or worry about wires and they work fine for that.  I have not experienced the disconnecting issues that others have reported.  This is a quality product that does most of what it advertises.  I don't really use them to talk on the phone that much but when I have, the people on the other end have complained about me ""breaking up"".

I have not taken these on walks or runs and would not be comfortable doing so as the only thing holding them in is the friction of the ear plug and there is a decent amount of weight to them hanging out of your ear (relatively speaking).  I don't think I'd feel comfortable taking these out into the world on a bus, etc..  They are made of some super slick material and really hard to hold onto and I am constantly dropping them.

The earbuds themselves have controls on them, which I consider a major drawback.  The panel is the size of a dime and I don't know how anybody with normal-sized hands could operate the controls.  Instead, whenever I adjust or remove them, something happens like the track skipping to the next one, the sound turning on or off or the volume adjusting.

Pros:
1. Wireless!
2. Decent sound.
3. Proven technology.
4. Battery lasts a decent amount of time.
5. Has a decent app for tweaking sound, if you're into that sort of thing.
6. Well-made.

Cons:
1. Expensive.
2. Sound good, not great.
3. Not noise-cancelling.
4. Tend to fall out.  Could use bigger earbud pads.
5. Slippery and easy to lose.
6. Controls on buds that are hard to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think these buds are great.  Some of the best sound you'll get out of ""truly wireless"" earbuds and not spend $300.  They do take some getting used to, especially with lots of complaints about ears hurting for the first couple weeks.  My ears hurt too, it seems that this is by design (??) because that's how Jabra engineered them to stay in.  The ear cups have a ""sharp"" edge that grips onto your ear canal.  This is uncomfortable at first but I eventually built up callouses or whatever, and it's not a problem anymore.

The plastic carry case is great, not bulky, and I forget it's in my pocket most of the time.  The hinge on the lid feels VERY fragile and I often feel like one accidental push in the wrong direction will snap it right off.  I am always super careful when I have the case open so I don't put any stress on that hinge.  If you break the hinge, the charging case won't work because it relies on the pressure from the lid to charge the buds.  They aren't held in by magnets or anything.  So again, break the hinge and you'll be shelling out $60 for a new case.

My biggest complaint is Jabra's warranty conditions.  My left earbud driver went out after 6ish months.  It still ""worked"" as in the buttons still functioned, but no sound came out.  I contacted Jabra for a warranty replacement, jumped through the typical hoops of rebooting the device, pairing it to another phone, bla bla bla.  They eventually sent me the warranty replacement form which required I provide proof of purchase AKA the store receipt.  I bought these at Best Buy and didn't think about needing the receipt.  So once I ""found"" the receipt, I processed the form and got a shipping label.  They said I have to ship the broken buds to them, then they will ship functioning ones back.  Ugh.  Seriously, this is the only company I've dealt with in the last 10 years who requires you to ship your product to them FIRST then they'll snail mail you back a replacement.  I've had warranty issues on phones, a Nest thermostat, and  other electronics and have never had to ship them mine first.  Now I get to use crappy earbuds for the next 3 or 4 weeks until Jabra gets around to shipping me a replacement. Grr.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Read on.","It took me a while to finally make the decision to purchase these -- on Black friday sale. The reason? While most reviewers online raved about these earbuds, the rating on Amazon.com is super low (3.6 stars at the time). I usually never consider anything less than 4 stars on Amazon.com. However, I've been wanting these for quite a while and given the black friday sale ($149) I thought I'd give them a try. Never looked back!! Here's my detailed review of this awesome product:

Pros:
1. Fit: Perfect. Honestly, the fit of these earbuds comes close to perfection. These buds won’t fall out of your ears no matter what you do. They use some sort-of rotate-and-lock mechanism (my own terminology) and they feel like they’re locked in place.
2. Noise-Isolation: Really good. This comes from the fact that they lock in place completely blocking the pathway to your ear canal. Comparing them to my Bose QuietComfort 35s, I dare to say that these are at least not worse at blocking outside noise.
3. Hear-through feature: Good. I haven’t been able to notice much difference between having the hear-through feature on or off when music is on. However when the music is off you can really tell the difference. In essence, you can use these as noise enhancement. When I have them in my earn with music off and hear-through off, I can hear everything so much better than without the earbuds.
4. Bluetooth connectivity: Very good. Firstly, these buds connect super-easy to your device (iphone for me) for the first time. After that it’s perfection. You take them out of the case and by the time they’re in your ears, they are connected and ready to go. Also when you’re done, just take them out of your ears and put them back in the case - that’s it. I did notice some connection drops in completely open spaces but never indoors.

So-so features:
1. Volume: Could be louder but it’s loud enough. Don’t get me wrong, these earbuds are pretty loud and in combination with the noise isolation, volume comes close to perfect. However, for some songs, if you’re one of those who want to put the volume to the max and get in the zone, you might be a little bit disappointed. However, that’s also a bad habit so it’s probably a good thing that these earbuds don’t do excessively high volume. Ps. I often find myself listening to songs at 60-70% volume, so again, they are relatively loud. Just not excessively so.
2. Music: Good. I don’t have much to say here cause I’m not an audiophile. Music is pretty ok. Not amazing but that’s to be expected and using the Jabra app you can customize bass, treble etc.

General advice:
1. This goes for all true-wireless earbuds. Find a systematic way to save them and their case everytime you take them off your ears. It’s so easy to lose them. In 2 weeks of use I found myself looking for them quite a few times.

Final thoughts: I couldn’t recommend more. Airpods are definitely worse. I find myself using my Bose QC35s less and less. Wired headphones? Never again..","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had tried other methods of wireless earbuds and found them unsuitable for various reasons, so I thought that I'd give these a try.  I'm so very glad I did!  The sound quality is fantastic, with excellent bass, and they fit in your ears very tightly, giving you 3 different sizes of pads from which to choose.  The pass-through mode is wonderful, allowing you to hear almost as well as if you weren't wearing any earbuds at all.  Even with the pass-through mode, they will last for at least 3 or 4 hours before needing a charge, and the charging case will store 2 full charges.  They also will give you an hour of inactivity before shutting themselves off, which is plenty of time.  This product is pricey, but it's worth it, especially if you are considering even more expensive offerings from Bose or Beats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can be fidly at first to keep them in correct in the ear canal . Never had them coming out. Sound is ok. You can adjust the equalizer to get them sounding right the way that you want to. They look good . They do not protrude too much compared to similar buds. Good style. Can be hard to lower/raise volume and change tracks because the button to press is very firm so you have to put kind of hard to do the volume- change tracks. Ear wax can get trapped in the holes so you end up cleaning. NO indicator on the charger case to know if its charging or low in battery. The pass through feature is great because sometimes you want to know what is going on around you and this does a great job doing that. Other wise, the noise cancelation is alright when the pass through is off.

I got the elite version but now I'd really recommend the active version instead. Because the elite one still falls off the ear even after repalcing the ear pads.  The problem was solved in the active version as they added a small wing to prevent it from falling off.
The charging case for the active has space for that wing whe the elist charging case won't have space for this eing even if you buy it as accessory to prevent it from falling off.

Otherwise both have the same great mic and great sound quality. It also can connect to two separate devices at the same time (phone and laptop)  which is a great feature.

Poor fit.","I have tried the different ear cushions that came with the kit but I still have problems getting them to stay in my ears - particularly the left one.  They tend to start sliding out, especially if I am eating, talking or otherwise moving my jaw.  I realize that this something specific to my personal ear form but I suspect that will be the case for a relavant number of buyers.  The in-ear design, with no secondary around-the-ear hook, just isn't going to work for everyone.  I would NEVER attempt to wear these while walking down the street or in most public areas where they could easily be lost if they popped out of my ears.  I plan on trying a pair of the foamy ear inserts (not included included in original kit) but I'm not sure I will be able to stand that insert stuffed in my ear.

Sound and features are OK.  No problems getting them to pair.

Hear-thru feature seeems a little gimmicky to me and seems a little laggy.

One annoying little thing (but common to most bluetooth earbuds that permit simultaneaous pairing to mutliple devices I suspect) is that you have very little control over which paired device gets use of the earphones.  Several times I have been on a web conference only to have my cell phone steal focus from the PC because of some notification beep.  Only way I have found to prevent this is to remember to turn-off bluetooth on one of the devices (and then try to remember to turn it on again).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I looked at many different options (Momentum Wireless were the main completion for these) but these sounded great and I loved them.... until...

The volume started lowering rapidly once they turned on....

I bought them in April, and they a 2 year warranty. So I had them 5 months and had a failure. Not great, but hey... there’s no such thing as a perfect product, and Incontaced their support. Here’s the problem:

I contacted them about the problem. You are lucky if you get a response within 24 hours. Ok, maybe I’m the exception to their customer service. After a 1 week back and forth, they say if I send the headphones in, they will ship me out a replacement as soon as they receive them without delay. Great!

It’s been over two weeks since they received them and they keep telling me the item is on back order (even though they offer free overnight shipping for the headphones as a new purchase). I asked them if there’s a way to expedite the order. Their response was “No”.

In summary, of all the headphones I’ve spent $150+ on, Jabra has been, by far, the worst.

That's how long you can expect the battery to hold out on this set of wireless earbuds and its charger with regular use.

Is it worth the price of admission for a year of usability? I would say no, but wireless earbuds as a whole are not really items built with longevity in mind. I would like to see that trend reversed.

I am constantly on guard of either them falling out or the discomfort of having them in for extended periods of time. That being said they pair extremely easy, very rarely drop signal, sound great, have a good enough battery life to where it’s only been an issue once, and and small and compact.

Buy THESE!!!","It has become very impractical to wear my wireless over-ears into the grocery store while on phone calls, so I decided to give the Jabra Elite 65t wireless earbuds a try. Here are the things I like and dislike about these buds.

Look: They are very discrete and perfect for the office. their neutral color scheme does not draw much attention. I'd say these go really well with business attire, or any attire for that matter.

Comfort: This is the only area that could be better in my opinion. Instantly, I feel the pressure from them resting on my cartiladge. After about 30-45 minutes of wear, my ears begin to hurt. Mine aren't exceptionally small either, as I've tried on earbuds by other brands. It's almost as if theres very little give or rubber-like material there except for the tip. It may be something to consider for the next version.

UPDATE: I switched from the medium tips to the large ones and it made all the difference in the world! Not only are they more comfortable, but the bass is deeper than before.  Changed to five stars!!!

Controls/Noise Cancelling: the Jabra Sound+ app is great! There's an equalizer, a hearthrough option to control whether you can or cannot hear your surroundings, and Soundscape sounds for times when you need to block out the world and focus. I cannot hear people talking or making regular noises at all when I have these on, music playing, and hearthrough off.

Sound Quality: Honestly, these earbuds remind me of my Bose QC35's! The bass is tight and punchy, the mids are not too recessed, and the highs are crystal clear! I love to let others experience this sound and watch their faces change from meh to WOW!

Again, if only they were a little more comfortable. If different tips make a difference, I will come back and update you all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall, they're great for my needs.
I use these mostly in class and while driving, as they have a feature allowing noise from your surroundings through. It isn't perfect, but it works in most cases for me.

I recently purchased comply memory foam ear tips for these, and while they sound much better, the tips are too big for the charging case, especially at certain angles, and I find that they get stuck in the case and don't come out with the earbuds.
They sound pretty good normally, and with the comply foam ear tips they sound even better. The eq can be adjusted from within the jabra app to your liking.
The app is ok, it works and I haven't experienced any major bugs as of yet.
The buds are relatively easy to lose, but I haven't had much of an issue with that as the case is small enough to keep in my pocket.

My only real gripes with these are that the memory foam tips don't fit well in the case, and that you cannot use the left earbud separately from the right. Neither problem is that big of an issue for me though.

Overall, these are great truly wireless earbuds that just seem to work. They connect quickly, theyre easy to control and use once you get used to the controls, and most importantly they sound good. I also haven't had any major issues with stuttering.

Update: I returned the Elite 65t and purchased the active version as it cost less, and they are nearly identical. They have a different finish, which I prefer, but they function exactly the same in my usage so far","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven't figured out a combination of soft foam inserts  that are comfortable, have good sound and stay in. If you use sufficiently large ones then you can't put the earbuds in the case to charge because they didn't leave enough space for anything but the small foam inserts. So you have to remove the foam inserts and then of course you will lose them because they're tiny and black.  I'm using this with an iPhone X and constantly have to mess around with the Bluetooth settings to connect to these.

So, of course, at that point I had to change another variable..  Turns out I have some strange interference in that part of my house.  Outside that area no crackling.  It is strange b/c I have a couple of Plantronics BackBeat FIT headphones that have no problem in that same area at all.  It seems that Jabra BT is more sensitive to your environment.  Hope this can be adjusted with firmware update.

A couple of more observations:
- i get minor dropouts while walking or running (like running to catch a bus, not treadmill running).  I never get that with any of my BackBeat FIT headsets.
- the case usability can be greatly improved with the use of magnets helping guide the earbud into its slot.  right, if you're accurate, the earbud will drop into its spot.. if not .. it can bounce right out.

These two are the reasons for 4 stars so far.

Fit is good (but may vary for you).  I appreciate the ability to use silicone eargels to achieve a tighter noise isolating fit.  that was one reason i looked at these rather than getting the airpods.  I like the ability to enable the pass-through feature - allows me to keep the earbuds when people interrupt with a quick question.

FIRST REVIEW
on the very first day, i'm hearing crackling in the left earbud just like a few other reviewers have reported.  when i play music on my phone, crackling sound starts right away and even starts to cause the music playback to stop probably b/c the earbuds are disconnecting.  I have galaxy S8 and use it successfully with a number of bluethooth devices without any problems.  Synthesizer on default setting - not really pushing the sound to new heights here.  updated firmware - no effect on this problem.  and of course, I charged them overnight before setting up and testing.

sure sounds like it is defective.  will be returning","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_305?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=305&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound isolation and speaker quality -- what I hear when I wear these -- are good. The battery life is good, and they fit well in my ear, staying in place while moving.
So if these were only for listening to music while working out, and not advertised as ""we are great at audio calls with so many microphones and fancy tech"", and not priced as the best things for music and calls, this would be a positive review.

But they are sold as the best thing for calls, and they are priced accordingly. And the microphone quality -- how people hear me when I talk through these -- is awful.

Lesser but still major problem: the activation force for the buttons is way too high. You either have to drive the earbuds deep into your head to get the buttons to click, or half-pull the earbud out to hold it with your fingers while pressing the button.
And a nasty sw bug that should be fixable: every time bluetooth connects, a random few seconds later the headphones change to near-maximum volume. Usually after starting music, while trying to lower the volume. Ouch. Ouch ouch ouch.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

He has a tendency to be rough on things like this so I was reluctant to spend the money, but they are rated as the best so I went for it. He LOVES them.
PROS: The sound quality is great, range is excellent, and they cancel noise almost too well- especially if you plan on running outside. My husband is able to go to other rooms without interrupting his music or phone calls. They have even gone through the wash and dryer with no apparent damage. The app allows users to change sound settings or search for misplaced earbuds, as well as offer support.
CONS: if you take one earbud out, you can't listen to music because the connection is lost, but if you plan to run safely outside, the noise cancellation makes it difficult to listen for hazards on the road.

Purchased them a few months ago after trying a number of others, both name brands and generics.  Didn't compare them to the $200+ competition (like Bose, etc.).

POSITIVES:
Sound quality is definitely better than earbuds in the $50 or less range.  I tried a few, even from ""brand names"" and these have better sound quality.
Nice app from Jabra that serves as a manual, software updater, etc.
Charging case is reasonably small and can recharge the buds when I'm out and about.  I charge the case every few days.
Several equalizer settings in the app to help you get sound that's appealing and accurate for you and your surroundings.
Work with my iPhone surprisingly well!  People can't tell I'm using wireless buds.  I can touch the right bud to answer or hang up, etc.
Stay in place without hooks.  Surprisingly, these buds don't attach to any part of the ear, and don't stick into the ear canal  a long way, but nonetheless, they remain in place, even when I'm in the gym on an elliptical or doing weight training.  I attribute that to the nature of the rubber fittings that come standard with the buds.  (See below for comments on replacing these.)
Seem durable.  I've dropped them a few times and they continue to work well.
Stylish look, both the buds themselves, and while on me.  (Some earbuds look garish when people wear them.  IMO, these don't look bad in place.)

NEGATIVES:
The case and the buds are very rounded, and can slip out of your fingers really easily.  I've read other reviews of them being dropped and being damaged.
Occasionally, I put the buds in the case to charge and one of them didn't charge.  Now, I'm careful to make sure they are in contact with the charging pins in the case and haven't had this happen.
Occasionally, the case shows that it is adequately charged to charge up the buds, but when I have used the buds, they run out of power pretty quickly.
When I wear them for more than than an hour, I have a little ear canal soreness.  Goes away when I take them out.  Probably shouldn't have them in for that long anyway.

COMMENTS:
These are not ""noise cancelling"".  If they fit well in your ear canal, they attenuate surrounding sound, but don't actively cancel noise.  I don't find that effect very powerful, but noticeably better than the Apple pods that just hang on your ears and don't seal the canal.
The amount of bass depends on the fit (like most earbuds).  My left ear fits better than the right, so there's a little difference in bass between the two.
I thought I would replace the rubber fittings to get a better seal, both for better noise attenuation and better sound.  Tried getting memory foam replacements specifically made for these Jabras.  Found that the rubber fittings that came with the Jabras had better sound quality and a more comfortable fit.  Stay with what comes with these buds!

OVERALL:
I recommend them for sound quality, etc.  Make sure you place them in the charging case so you see that they are in contact with the charging pins, and be careful when you're handling them so you don't drop them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The app is fine as well - though there's no iPad version which always irks me. Unfortunately, there are a few things I just couldn't get past.

First, they feel cheap - plastic everywhere. The case is plastic, slippery, and very lightweight, so I found myself dropping it quite often. It's a huge step down from my Zolo Liberty+ headphones which has a metal case.  The case is also microUSB, which I just despise *so* much. The case needs to be USB-C.

There's a bit of latency when watching videos; everyone has different levels of sensitivity to this. My wife is far more sensitive to seeing audio/video latency than I am, but it was just enough for me to notice. I may have talked myself into thinking it was OK the first week, but over time I bet I'd find it more irritating.

These are expensive compared to the many options available from other lesser-known brands; if they had USB-C I might have kept them, but I just can't justify buying a new device using microUSB in 2019. I returned these to Amazon.

Jabra needs to update this product with USB-C, tighten up the latency, and drop the price the $129 or less to be competitive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_303?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=303&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These little earbuds sound better than my klipsch wired earbuds. I am no audiophile but they do have different sound signatures and these have more clarity and positioning of the audio sources in the tracks and the vocals sound more clear and less muffled and mixed together in these compared to my klipsch. Bass has more impact too.

They are extremely convenient without the need to worry about wires and they sit securely in my ears. I do need to twist them in as described in the manual.

They look much better and low profile than certain competitors on the market.

Cons:

Charging can take a loooooooong time.

Can get uncomfortable after sitting in my ears for a few hours.

Sometimes there is interference when using in a crowded metro, not sure if it comes from the electric trains/railway tracks or wireless devices other people use.

Neutral:

Decent sound isolation but still allows you to hear outside noise, regardless of which mode you set to in the app.

I have been using these in months and overall I am pretty satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But for gym use, never had an issue of them falling out. Not really good for full face helmets -- not ones that fit tight. Half Helmets is ok, again, wearing a fitted head band will help keep them from flying off for sure. But for everyday use, at work, with the noise cancellation it's great. The mics that allow for outside sound to get in while using them is good. Takes some time to get use to them because it amplifies everything with the mics.

However, if you receive a faulty product, Jabra appears not willing to resolve the issue. My headphones stopped working properly after a short while. I have been trying to contact Jabra and get a replacement for the last 2.5 months. I filed multiple cases and sent many mails. Sometimes, I received an answer after weeks; but this answer would not resolve the issue.

Buyers should take this behavior into account when buying the product. Products on the frontier of tech, like this one, frequently have problems. If then, the manufacturer ignores warranty claims, the buyer is stuck with the faulty product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The Elite Active 65t overcome issues i have experience with both the Bragi and Zolo earbuds. They come close to having my full wish list of features, but don't have everything.

Pros:
1. Great sound quality.
2. Great battery life.
3. Comfortable. Took me about a week to get used to getting them seated perfectly when putting them in my ears, but no problems after that.

Cons:
1. Micro usb instead of usb-c for the charging case.
2. The charging case is not magnetic. Sometimes the earbuds fall out when I open it.
3. I use the earbuds to connect to my phone and laptop. When connected to both devices simultaneously, the audio focus has been an issue. When i listen on the laptop and a call comes in, or the phone makes an audible notification sound, the audio focus will switch to the phone without issue. However, it will not switch back. In order to switch back to the laptop sounds, i have to go into the computer settings then disable and re-enable the bluetooth connection.
4. Only the right earbud can be used independently. If i'm listening while at work, and the battery is getting low, i would appreciate being able to put one earbud back in the case to charge while listening to the other.
5. Color. I desire the earbuds to be all black; therefore, i purchased at Best Buy to get the exclusive Titanium Black edition. However, even then the buttons are a silver color. I would appreciate this area being black too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Multi-point.  Seamless transition between two devices.  Stop music on one, play on the other, without having to re-connect.

2. Microphone.  The quality of the mic is very good, so I can use it at work during zoom calls.

Some pretty horrible design flaws IMO.

1. No magnet on the bud. So they'll just slip right out of the charger. Yay.
2. The left bud is useless without the right.  Better would be the option to use them separately to extend battery life.
3. Plastic is slippery, so it's easy to fumble them.

Battery life therefore is good, if you consider 5 hours good. I've heard that you get a very solid 5 hours though, usually a little more.

The app is pretty cool but no matter what eq setting I use, it doesn't sound all that different to me :)

Comfortable, very secure fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have to turn my bluetooth connection off and then turn it back on to reconnect then sounds would start to play.  A lot of times it disconnects for no real reason.

I wrote customer support; they responded with a list of suggestions I had already tried. Wrote again: no response. Wrote more times, still no response. So I had to call. After a twenty minute wait, I had something else come up and had to hang up. Tried to call again; another twenty minute wait and got through. The gentleman promised to send a replacement right ear bud if I filled out a form. Filled it out, and they said they would be in contact soon.

A week and a half went by, then I got an ""order summary"" for a right ear bud. That was three weeks ago. It still hasn't shipped. With a new baby and a new job, I haven't had time to spend another twenty minutes on the phone just to be told to wait another week.

The headset volume can't be operated independent from the device so lowering the volume on notch on either from minimum mutes it.  You only have choices of mute, loud, or even louder.

I also have owned a pair of wired Bose Quietcomfort 20's for several years so I'll try to compare.

Connectivity:
Jabra 5, Bose 4(wired)
The Jabra connected instantly and connects every time I turn on Bluetooth on my phone.  Bose is wired so the obvious here.

Audio:
Jabra 4, Bose 5
Just about on par with Bose but you'll need to use the Sound+ app to get to a place that you like.  I like the richness of the Bose but the Jabra come very close.

Noise Cancelling:
Jabra 3.8, Bose 4.5
I don't think the Jabra's have noise cancelling but they are very close to the Bose especially when the volume is turned up.  I haven't used these on a flight yet and I'm expecting the same experience as the Bose (ie let's in some background noise).  Mowing the lawn is pretty damn close for both.

Comfort:
Jabra 5, Bose 5
I typically use medium ear buds but put the larger ones on the Jabra which helped blocked out more noise.  Jabra are very comfortable and I forget they are in my ear.  Bose is very comfortable as well and have that little ear hook that keeps them in place.  They both stay in while working out and I don't have any issues feeling like the Jabra will fall out.

Controls:
Jabra 5, Bose 4
I really like being able to press a button on Jabra for volume, pause, skip a song etc.  Since the Bose is wired, I typically run the wire under my shirt and have the phone in my pocket and control it with the in-wire controller which sits near my chest.  I wouldn't say the Bose is bad here but tapping on the ear is much more convenient and being able to do so without pulling the phone out is great.  That's the other thing, I can leave my phone out of pocket near me which is awesome.

Chewing gum:
Jabra 2.5, Bose 4.5
I like to chew gum when working out and its natural for the ear to move which affects the Jabra more with sort of a thumping sound vs. Bose which I never thought much of when chewing gum until using the Jabra where it's pretty evident.  So, I try no to chew as much.

Charging:
Jabra 5, Bose 2
I love the charging case and the fact that it continues to charge the earbuds in the case which is so much better than the Bose where you need to connect the cable in advance to make sure you have enough juice to have noise cancelling work for the amount of time you'll use them. I don't have any information on how long it takes to charge each, how long it lasts etc because I frequently charge them both and they both seem to charge up rather quickly.  However, I've forgotten to charge my Bose a few times and have to use my car connection to charge them on the way to the gym.  I don't feel like this would be the case for Jabra.

Value:
Jabra 5, Bose 3
I picked up the Jabra for 1/3 off during prime day in addition to 20% back on my prime awards card. Bose runs around $250 so for something that performs almost as well for around half the price is great value.

Other:
I can walk pretty far away from my phone to the water fountain at the gym and still have connectivity.  It does start to break up a little.  Sorry, I don't have the distance.  Maybe 75-100 feet.

I haven't worn my Bose since I've had these so that's probably saying something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are times only one earbud provides sound and the only way you can get them both working again is to put them back into the charger then remove them again. That’s not convenient while on the go.

The other very big issue for me was toggling to the transparent mode. You’re supposed to be able to push the button on the side of the earbud to stop the music and hear people attempting to speak with you but I often found it very inconsistent and was forced to completely remove one earbud to have a conversation. I had other minor glitches with the app and for that reason I returned them.

I now have my fingers crossed waiting on the arrival of the Sony WF-SP700n true wireless ANC earbuds. The problems with these don’t justify the price tag.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_330?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=330&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But comes with pain, and connectivity issues.","These are great true-wireless earbuds; they really are. I would agree with people when they say that these are probably the best on the market. But I have some qualms with their design that I just cannot get past.

1. They hurt my ears.
In over 2 decades, I've never worn headphones or earbuds that actually physically hurt when I wore them. But these do. The form of the casing presses against the cartilage around my ear (anti helix, anti tragus, and tragus) that ends up hurting like hell after an hour or so. It's fine if I don't adjust or move them (or press the buttons). And, yes, I'm sure that I actually have them in correctly.

2. Connectivity.
This seems hit or miss. Some people say they have great range and connectivity, others don't. I was one of the ones that don't. Paired with a Samsung S8 (so both the phone and headphones have BT 5.0), they can't really go that far. In addition to that, when ""switching states"" (i.e. loading a new YT video, turning off music, etc.) the audio in the right bud just cuts with a click for about a second (this includes the audio pass-through). Even then, sometimes they'll just both go in and out even with my phone two feet in-front of me.

But, hey, the audio quality is fantastic and they feel super stable in your ear. Plus, audio pass-through is a wonderful thing. If they weren't $160 I would take some sandpaper and grind down parts of the casing to make them feel better in my ear, but I really don't/shouldn't have to do that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Buds are comfortable, fit well, sound is good and everyone can hear me well. The case is a super cheap joke. Be careful as these do not have a magnet to secure the earbuds at all, not the easiest to open and the top piece of plastic feels like something of quality you get out of a gum ball machine. I do not have Fred Flintstone large Mitts and hands but I also find it hard to take these out of my ear worried that the rubber piece may stay in there when I have too aggressive of a pull.

I was looking for a replacement for my apple iPods and these almost did. I love being able to hear my conversation in both ears, and like I said earlier the quality is good. Forgot to mention the distance from my phone is kind of a short range as well...Ill. keep them but I'll probably loose one or both in the future without some sort of security in the case or putting in the case.

Looks like th e75t is coming out and they still only have the distance as 33 feet and no mention of some sort of magnet holding them in the case for security....bummed","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't listen to metal, but if I did, I'd feel confident head banging without losing them. The battery is said to last five hours, but I've never ran them past yellow. They pop into a conveniently sized case, with insanely fast charging speed. Their sound is nice and balanced. I'd say it's on par, or even superior to comparable buds with a wire. Which brings me to the most important thing, the freedom of wireless earbud technology. From yoga, to snowboarding, hiking, to cooking, cleaning, to writing, I've found the lack of wire on my Jabra Elite Active 65t's to be absolutely liberating.

Not only does music sound great, but podcasts come through clear as day. And in true Jabra fashion, the former headset company has produced another conversation capable earpiece. When a call comes through, all have to do is say “yes” to accept it. You can track them if they’re lost or stolen. And they’re dust and water resistant! The features are endless.

After three weeks of ownership, I love them, there's just one problem. They don’t work half the time! Okay, maybe it isn’t half the time, probably more like a quarter, but all too often, when I pop my Jabra Elite earbuds in, they get stuck on “connecting…”. I’ve noticed that the issue is more prevalent in congested areas. Trying to connect in the lift line? Forget about it.

I keep expecting there to be some software update to offer a fix, but I haven't been able to check, because the ""Jabra sound+"" app is completely useless. It connected the first day and hasn't recognized my earbuds since. It’s hard to call these things Elite, when at times, they’re nothing more than jewelry. Oh yeah, they're also discreet. But that doesn’t matter when they won’t produce sound! I have no doubt that these things will one day be awesome, but it seems to me that their current software just isn't quite ready yet.

So, if you're on the fence about wireless earbuds, I'm not quite sure what to say. On the one hand, my Jabra Elite Active 65t's are amazing, they're liberating, so much so that I can't see myself ever going back to the wire. But on the other hand, they're frustrating, less than reliable, and far from cheap. My guess is that these first-generation buds were rushed to compete with the likes of Apple's Pods, and that both their price and consistency will improve with time. I want to advise you to wait, it's the wise thing to do, but the freedom of these things (when working) is almost too good to be true. I could return them, but I'd rather listen while I wait. If only (slightly more than) half the time.

After 4 months, the left earbud stopped working. I did some research and it appears the charging case has small magnets inside the case that come loose and stops charging the left earbud. I filed a warranty claim with Jabra and the people were very friendly but not helpful. They refused to take a look at the case issue and insisted on only shipping the earbuds and no case. It took about 2 weeks to get the RMA approved and it’s been 2 months and counting since I sent them back for replacement. They keep pushing back the shipping date claiming that they are back ordered. I don’t understand why since you can readily purchase them new for immediate shipping.

I cannot speak for runners as I do not run, but I wore them during an afternoon of gardening and lots of deep bending and they did stay put.

Instructions are bare bones, but these buds are very easy to operate without.  They come with a charging case, but the charging cord won't fit in the case.

Trust me, I've gone though many, many kinds. No name cheapies, big brands, different styles, price points, ect. But my search has ended! Enter the Jabra Elite 65t

Audio quality is excellent! Crank up the volume and enjoy the bliss of, dare I say, perfect quality? Yes I do. They have nice range, and everything sounds amazing. No distorted audio at all. Volume is plentyy loud enough and will definitely kick.

Build quality is as I'd expect in this price range. They don't feel like they'd break if I dropped one. They have a nice size to protect from a regular drop I suspect. With the nice build quality, comes the comfort. These elites don't hurt my ears after hour long sessions. One of the biggest gripes I've had with past buds.

Another plus is the perfect Bluetooth connection.  No signal cutting out, and songs going choppy here. I've had that before with cheapies. Big win there.

The case itself is sleek and seems to be durable as well. I am confident it will protect my buds from normal daily travel. The case may scratch up, but it's doing it's job. The case closes nicely and should also stay closed until you open it. No weak lock here. So your buds won't go missing

Price point is iffy. These are the most expensive I've ever bought. I am happy with them though, and you do get what you pay for though. I doubt price is much an issue these days, with all the Airpods I see in people's ears. I'd bet my money on the Jabras over Airpods anyday. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-Small size of the earbuds give a low profile.
-Sound quality is above average, and having a built-in equalizer helps emphasize certain audio ranges. Although, it admittedly lacks a satisfying bass.
-Battery life is amazing, where I usually get ~4-5 hours at 50% to 70% volume.
-Charging case allows the earbuds to charge relatively fast.
-Background noise feature allows me to be aware of my surroundings.
-The design of the earbuds and its ear tips allow them to be stable inside of the ear and not require earbud wings in order to prevent them from falling out.
-Earbuds are light-weight and don't cause ear fatigue when wearing them for a few hours.
-Bluetooth 5 allows for quick pairing and extended range (they pair up before I even get them into my ears).

Cons:
-Biggest problem I have with these earbuds are the battery drain it appears to have every so often. After taking them out of the case, it would drain to ~70% in less than an hour. This issue has happened a few times. After it hits the ~70% mark the battery drain returns to normal/expected time, where it then reaches the advertised 5 hours of battery life.
-The charging case itself is not exactly small, but also not exactly large. If placed in a pocket, it will definitely make a noticeable bulge.
-Often makes a high-pitched hissing sounds when taking them out of the case. Not too bad considering the hiss is short lived.
-Noise distortion happens occasionally as a result of environmental factors (happens at certain locations at my uni).
 -MicroUSB charging. I don't want to carry around an extra cable to charge the case. Jabra should utilize USB-C next time.

Notes:
-Common issues seem to be the left earbud not working after a certain period of time. So far, both of my earbuds work perfectly fine (~2 months after purchase).

I would definitely recommend these earbuds to anyone who's looking for true wireless earbuds. They are comfortable and provide great sound. The issues it does have are minor and usually aren't isolated to this specific brand. Overall, they are a 4.5/5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought a set of the Jabra 65t Elite at a local big box store.  They worked great for about a week or so - great fit, great battery life, good sound, ability to use just right earpiece, loved the Alexa/Siri activation feature.  I then installed the iOS app and performed a firmware upgrade.  After the upgrade, almost all the audio now only comes through the left earpiece.  Have tried resetting the set.  Searched message boards and found this to be a known problem that Jabra only give Tier 1 support type answers to, barely acknowledging that the problem exists.  Have since tried recommended fixes and hacks to resolve the issue, including uninstalling/reinstalling the iOS app, changing the language and installing two more firmware upgrades that have come out since.  Still no resolution after many months.  If I has known that is issue existed before looking for something to buy, I probably would have avoided these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got it because Wirecutter recommended it.

Two issues which are dealbreakers

1. The case is poorly designed. I've broken the clasp that clips it open/closed on two bases with daily usage for the past 14 months but I am not hard on it at all. The Airpods are magnetic to prevent this kind of issue. now the case stays open and the buds fall out or won't charge. have to use a rubberband to keep it shut and works *most* of the time. airpods by design dont have these issues.
2. Can't call switch - when call switching from iPhone, sometimes the audio becomes completely messed up. to fix it, you have to hang up the call and call back. (not as much of a dealbreaker)

airpods sit in the ear without a proper seal so really bad to listen to with lots of ambient noise (unusable in propeller planes)","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One of the issues with writing reviews is that you really need to test out a product before you can review. I can say with honesty I have tested these headphones in almost every condition: Winter in the snow, Spring Rain, while exercising in the summer heat, and even in NYC Subway with all the noise!

These headphones are great and comfortable.  I was looking for an alternative to AirPods as they hurt to wear them.  These have the Bud style in-ear which is the same as the wired headphones. Great Sound and quality, the noise cancellation works very well and dulls out the loudest noise, connects to my iPhone in seconds.

Here are a few notes to decide and take away:

- Test the headphones: You may need to swap out the ear buds for the correct size.  I found myself stopping during my  work outs as they had dropped out of my ears a few times.  Swapping them to bigger earbuds helped hold them in, you may need to use the bigger size. (I do high impact workouts like boxing so bear in mind I really move around) You also don't want to lose them so be sure to test them in a controlled environment before you start running thru the woods and have an ear bud slip out.

- Adjust the system: Downloading App to adjust your headphones is a must (Snap shot included), it helps to adjust them to your surroundings and the main activities you do. I found some settings better than others in the subway and other settings better at the gym etc.

- Clean them often: Especially if you sweat for workouts like me, sometimes the salt builds up and I forgot to clean the charging case (Pic Included)  But it helps to use an alcohol based electronic wipe.

- Charge time is fast and holds power for a long time. Plus just like the AirPods it also charges in the case.

Negative Points:

-Charging case is a snap shut case vs the AirPods Magnetic closure. Im always afraid I am going to break the darn thing or open it too hard and have the Buds come flying out. (happened a few times when I first started using them) The case is ok, but could use some engineering adjustments.

- Hearthrough mode option just doesn't work right.  (Option found in the App, pic attached). You hear everything and it makes it difficult to use especially on a phone call. I just keep it on noise cancelling and call it a day.

- Need to take both buds out quickly or only one will turn on. Some times I need to put them back and take them out to turn on both. Not sure if this is a syncing issue but the individual buds do work just like AirPods if you need them to. But when using both, you need to take them out right away or it will only activate just one Bud.

-If you are in an area where a lot of people are using wireless devices you may start to hear static interference. I had to put my earbuds back in the charging case and take them out again. It helps re-sync to the phone and clear up the static issue.

Final Thoughts: Great Purchase and buy, I have had them for 7 months (as of this review posting) with little to no issues and even the ones I mentioned are more minor annoyances.  There is an option between the regular earbuds and the athletic water resistant model. I purchased the the Active model knowing how I would use them, they cost a few dollars more (approx. $20) So I cannot state this great review would be for the regular Elite model.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The functions and integrated app are both phenomenal, the battery life and sound quality is very good, above my expectations. However, the width of the earbud itself is too big for my ears and has nothing to do with simply swapping out the ear gels. The pain of wearing these for any extended period, I can only compare to sleeping on your ear wayyyy too long compressing your cartilage. Also, I have a tragus piercing therefore I can't see myself ever comfortably wearing these.

The reality is that this technology is in its infancy.  All truly wireless headphones are having similar issues.  I would say even in this regard Jabra is the best.  If you want truly wireless headphones that never have any type of tech glitch than wait a few years to buy them.  Knowing this I place the warranty terms at the top of my priority list.  I have had two issues with my Jabra 65t over the last year and have very simply returned them for a brand new pair both times without any fuss.  I keep a pair of MPOW headphones that are 15 dollars as backups.  When I have had issues and have had to ship my Jabra's back I simply switch over to those.  Within 5-7 days I have my brand new pair of Jabra's ready to go.  Nothing in the truly wireless space compares to Jabra's quality or warranty point blank periot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wore them on Friday and they worked well.  Though whoever designed the case should be taken out behind the barn and horsewhipped!!  It is amateurish and stupid!!!  Once you figure out how to get the case open, the buds pop right up in the air since there is nothing to hold them in the case.  Why are there no magnets to retain them, I don't know.  If magnets are a problem, they coudl have least used some plastic grips.  It is plain amateur!

Today, Monday I used them again.  I discovered that the Left bud stopped working.  It was paired and I could see the connection flickering on and off in the app.  I did a complete reset and started over.  Still no change.  Called Jabra support and after a 45 minute wait (never a good sign), she recommended that I reset them.  When I told her I already had, she said there was nothing to do but return them for a replacement.  Actually, I am seeking a refund.

My biggest concern and requirement is that the earbuds physically fits into my ear and stays in my ear.  I can't use apple earphones or air buds as the design isn't conducive with my ears.  These Jabra Elite Active 65t earbuds are a phenomenal, secure, conforming fit.  They are equally well on a treadmill, elliptical, stairclimber, bike or rower.  I also lift heavy weights and there hasn't been an exercise that has caused issues with the earbuds staying in  place.  The sound quality is excellent as well as the volume control.  Battery life is fine for my usage profile...I find I need to recharge every several days with several hours of use/day.  The quality of the build is also robust....no fears of anything wearing out or breaking apart.  If I had to complain, the controls are a little tricky to use as my fingers are a little big but it hasn't proven to be an issue..  To net: the Jabra Elite active 65t works great for the application it was designed (active usage, like exercise), build quality looks great, sound is excellent (pass through is a nice feature if you need to hear your surroundings), battery life is more than adequate for moderate usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought them to replace my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 noise-cancelling headphones, because I was tired of carrying them around when travelling and they weren't useful for the gym.

These earbuds are extremely comfortable (as long as you can get used to the pressure fit in your ear canal), lightweight, good at blocking ambient sound and great at picking up your voice during calls. I have used them on long flights to block ambient noise and listen to podcasts and watch movies on my ipad. (One disadvantage is you can't connect them to in-flight entertainment systems, unless you spend ~$40 on a bluetooth transmitter that will plug into a standard headphone port.) They stay in fine when I'm running, and there's no cable to bounce around or snag on things.

Audio quality is acceptable, but not exceptional. If you're ok with iPhone earbuds, these are better than those, but not as good as headphones like the Bose QC35 or even high quality wired in-ear buds. But that's to be expected given their tiny size. So they're not audiophile, but in most case they do a totally acceptable job.

The size is where these really win. I can leave them in the outer pocket of my backpack and they take up essentially no room, and they're always recharging when I put them back in their case. I do wish they made the case a brighter color, however - I can see a real risk of dropping it on a airplane floor during a flight and not noticing, since it's black. I've tried to prevent that by wrapping some yellow tape on the case.

I purchased these from another retailer because they were out of stock here at the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_403?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=403&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use these with a iPhone SE, which might be an issues since it does not support BT 5.0, but if your device doesn't support BT 5.0 either I advise against dishing out the cash for a mediocre product.

I had previously bought a pair of cheaper earbuds, ENCAFIRE 18 earbuds (less than half $ of these). Were they all I had hoped for, no, but they played music reasonably well. However after about 3 weeks, I ended up ditching them for the jabras for one primary reason.

Ive tried other pairs of true wireless earphones such as the B&O E8s and each pair would cut out and loose signal or sync between the two headsets.  Very inconsistent playback and just riddled with problems.  The Jabra did not do this and has performed exceptionally well.  Sound quality is extremely good in all conditions and while they are not noise cancelling perse they do block out a lot of the ambient noise around you.  The Jabra app that accompanies the earphones provides you with enough capability to customize your experience and sound with an equalizer.  The battery storage unit is small enough to fit in your pocket and provides 10 hours of additional charging.  My favorite feature of the earphones is that they auto connect to my phone when I pull them out of the storage case and I dnever have to fumble around connecting them.  They just work! Also if you are listening to something and want to pause to speak to someone, simply pull one of the earphones from your ear and it pauses the audio until you put it back in your ear. Cool feature.

Overall I strongly prefer the dash and feel like I wasted my money on the 65t's.

They're not on the same level as a Dash Pro or even a Dash. If Bragi hadn't dumped the hardware business, I'd just buy another Dash Pro.

Cons vs. the Dash/Dash Pro:
Audio on the 65t is very tinny.  Laughably so.
Device feels flimsy/delicate.
They fall out easily when talking or chewing or on their own after a bit
They protrude further from your ears (earmuffs/industrial ear protection won't fit over them)

Pros of the 65t vs the Dash/Dash Pro:
Much faster connecting to the phone each time.
Smaller/better charging package.
I prefer the buttons to the touch.  Bragi's touch has always required multiple gestures from me.
It's an actual company that didn't lie about warranty support.  Repeatedly.  Over the course of months.  Seriously - the owners at Bragi should be ashamed.  The  company lied and stole from people.

Going to use my Dash Pros until they die and then see what's on the market at that time.

These earbuds worked amazing for first few months of use. At first they hurt my ears to wear for large lengths of time but my ears got used to them. After that more and more problems such as connectivity issues and balance started to appear. To elaborate, when i took the earbuds out of the case to use for a minute or two they would not play at all or the audio would skip A LOT. I would have to manually disconnect the earbuds and reconnect them in the Bluetooth menu. This sounds like a minuscule problem but after awhile it gets annoying not being able to right out use them when you take them out of the case. The balance issue came after, and that entailed the right earbud slowly losing volume in comparison to the left until it was at a VERY noticeable 10% of the left earbuds power. Looking it up it seems to be a common problem that Jabra knows about and have ""attempted"" to fix in an update but it hasn't worked. Various remedies to this problem i have found online haven't worked either so i'm stuck listening to all my media focused to the left. Very disappointing in the longevity of the product as apart from these big problems i like them very much.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Prefacing the review by saying I previously had the Zolo Liverty+ and sent them back, mostly due to the case and not good fit in the ear. Aside from that, I've used many other headphones like the BeatsX, Jaybirds etc.

My review specifically looks at these three use cases and hopefully, it's helpful to people in similar situations.

1. Gym work
These are the first headphones that actually stay in place using the bench. Even without the comply tips (only available in small size), the little tips stay in place really well. I don't sweat a lot so haven't tested that 'issue', but I've used them for different types of workouts and they have stayed in well.

Sound quality is in the 'good enough' category. As they get a decent fit on my ears (your mileage may vary), the sound and bass come across quite well.

2. Running
Running with earphones is usually where most fail. The 65t's worked surprisingly well and I barely had to touch them on a 5 mile run. The tips may start to move if they got more sweaty, but the angle of the microphone helps to secure them to the ear lope and aids the fit.

One downside - as the fit is quite good, I do get the 'boom boom' when I run. As each foot hits the ground you can 'hear' it in the earphone. It's not a deal breaker but definitely a negative.

3. Audio calling
I mostly use my cellphone at work, and so far they've been working great. I keep them in front of me and when I get a call in I attach just the right and answer it. Callers say they have no issues hearing me. Experience on iPhone and Android seems similar.

I've not commented on the battery life, case, etc as others have done a good job there. Overall, for my use they are working great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_403?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=403&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here's why:","I've been using these Jabra Elite 65t earbuds for two weeks now to give them a fair run before expressing an opinion. In my mind, the best measure of a product is to ask, if you own several competing products, which one do you find you consistently reach for, use and leave the house with. I've appreciated my Bose Quiet Comfort noise cancelling headphones especially during noisy airplane flights. Enjoyed the surprisingly premium sound of the Sony WF100x/BM1 wireless bluetooth buds and the light, waterproof utility of the lower cost Sony WI-SP500 bluetooth buds. But these Jabra Elite 65t buds have become my new favorites that I use every day now to the exclusion of the others.  Here's why. First is their lasting power. They can be used constantly for a full 5 hours without a recharge which raises the bar for wireless ear buds. Then after the charge is finally depleted they can be recharged in their case, twice, for a full 15 hours of listening before needing to recharge the case that night. Second big plus is the fit. Many ear buds I've tried or owned feel like they're always about to fall out of your ear so you modulate your movements accordingly. These come with several inserts to try, but the ones initially attached fit my ears perfectly. Everyone's ear anatomy is unique, of course, so your impression might vary. But the body of these seem like they were custom molded to my outer ear shape. You insert them and give them a quarter twist so they seat effortlessly and so comfortably I can easily forget they're even there. Fitting so well into the ear canal, they naturally eliminate most ambient noise and require less power to push them since the sound is routed directly into the ear canal. There's an app you can download that also allows you to slightly vary the amount of ambient noise allowed in so if you're on public transportation or say a flight, you won't miss an announcement or PA. There's a rudimentary equalizer in the app that actually does work to tailor your sound somewhat. At the moment, I'm streaming from an Amazon Prime Music play list and the base, depth and soundscape, at least to my non audiophile ears is incredible. Music can be paused by pressing the center of the right bud. Adjust the volume by pushing the left or right side of the left bud which is made more tactile by two small bumps, one on each side. The app let me know there was an update to the buds available, which I downloaded to the case and then the buds updated once inserted in the case. A purple light on the case flashed until the update was complete  and then a green light was displayed. As for the case, it's almost half the size of the Sony WF100's and has more ergonomic  curved edges so is even skinny jeans pocket friendly. The case is smooth and feels both protective and very sturdy. The one negative of that case is it's a little difficult to open but I suppose that should eliminate ill timed openings that might release the buds into your pocket or bag. It's recharged via the included USB cable. A full charge is said to take about 2 hours. To sum it up then. Likes: great battery life, exceptional moulded fit in the outer ear and ear canal, excellent sound reproduction and volume...I never need to go above 50%, a functional phone app with usable though basic equalizer, connection is very solid rarely having any hiccup, operation for voice calls has also been clear on both ends and solid, sturdy and very compact storage and charging case, . The music also automatically pauses when you remove a bud from your ears. Dislikes: It might actually tune out too much ambient noise, so I don't wear them if I'm doing something that requires being aware of your surroundings for safety sake. Sound reproduction is an individual preference and these aren't audiophile experiences obviously, as high end Sennheiser or Sony over ear earphones. But for their intended use, these are the buds I carry with me and use every day now. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Poor Bluetooth connection. Needlessly complex","I was told review after review that these earbuds are the promised land of true wireless Bluetooth headphones. We're not there yet. The android Jabra apps, which are supposedly both required to operate the headphones are needlessly complicated, and somehow inhibit basic functionality (when my headphones are synced as a media device is expect them to play media playing in my device). They allow setting up numerous profiles, for differen0t atmospheric sounds conditions. How these actually equate to usage totally escapes me, and obfuscates the features of the earbuds (I can never tell when I can and cannot enable 'passthrough' mode).

As far as Bluetooth goes, I get frequent sound gaps/clips due to interference, or because these basically require line of sight to work effectively. God forbid I want to keep my phone in my pocket while listening to music.

Physical construction and sounds quality is good, though. Microphone clarity is impressive, and the battery life in the charging case is extensive.

When these earbuds work, they work well. Unfortunately, that is only ~60% of the time and the Bluetooth, and app configuration leaves such a terrible impression that their use is overall frustrating.

Update: I've updated my score to a 3 because I was able to improve the bluetooth issues with settings, but the score remains lower due to the very poor experience I've had with customer support. Customer support took on average 5 days to respond over email, never attempted to assist in debugging issues (didn't even ask what device I was connecting them to..) and only answered my questions about the return process after I badgered them on email and twitter. Fortunately I was able to improve the bluetooth connection after digging through forums and was able to fix the media playback issues, and at least improve the bluetooth connection (see my reply to this comment).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm really shocked to see only 3.5 stars for these so felt the need to put in a good word for a good company.  I use my earbuds for exercise and I am a notorious earbud killer.  Most of them are manufactured very cheaply and designed to fail or become outdated in a short period of time.  I've had B&O (nice sound awesome customer service but continually break), Jaybird, Powerbeats, and the most recent Samsung IconX version 2; which failed after 2 months and warranty never sent me a replacement.  Samsung also has HORRIBLE to non-existent customer care.  They will help you but it takes 10 calls and repeating yourself over and over.

Enter Jabra Elite, Sounds great with right earpiece, stays in my ear, pairs quickly and easily with my phone.  Easy skip tracks and adjust volume.  Like having access to Google Assistant and for me most importantly BUILD QUALITY.  No fail so far and I've been running in the Hot Texas sun for 3 or 4 months.  Also, don't tell Jabra but I dropped the earbuds from a 3 story floor hearing them crash to the hard concrete.  I knew I was going to be buying a new headset.  Well I found them all in one piece!!! Nearly zero damage.  My next thought was that the sound would be off.  Put them in my ear and would never know this happened.  I can't say how happy I was.

In the past I've owned cellular phones stores and can say that back then and even today Jabra's customer service is excellent.  If you believe in supporting companies that truly back their products Jabra is hands down the winner for the price point.  (B&O does very well too)  They get the issue fixed promptly as they recognize your loss of use of the product.  Very good job and thank you Jabra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, the most disappointing quality of the headphones is the volume limit. I know this a safety feature but these are by far the quietest earbuds I have ever owned. This feature alone has led to me regretting buying the product. Also, there’s a white noise that I can hear out of the left earbud at low volumes which makes listening to podcasts unbearable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Like many others,the auto on/off feature when removing and returning to the case was not working.  This stopped working after owning these for about 8 months.  After researching the issue, I came across a comprehensive thread online that described the problem and the fix with pictures and a lot of detail.  Rather than try to deal with a warranty return/repair, I made a self-repair.  The issue is that the magnets in the case that trigger the auto on/off when the earbuds are placed in the case become dislodged and no longer function properly.  To repair, I removed the base that holds the earbuds from the rest of the case, and reinserted the magnets using adhesives to keep them in place. The fix worked, but the base tore a bit when removing from the case due to the adhesives that were used. It took a lot of force to separate one from the other.  It sounds like this is a common problem and, hence, my comment about questionable quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In each device that I tried I had the sensation of their not being properly pushed. Even at maximum volume I felt like they were quieter than I preferred. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that with truly excellent earphones, the sound is often so clean as to allow higher volumes without stressing the ear. That was certainly the case with these earphones. I felt like they were better than my devices. I have a Toshiba Satellite gaming laptop, an Amazon Fire tablet (latest version), and a Samsung cell phone that is so old that it is crying to be replaced (I feel, however, that I've been permanently pushed out of the smart cell phone market - the prices have gotten so absurdly out of hand that I simply refuse to buy another - seriously people, we've reached the point where you either have to sign a long term contract that you can't get out of or you have to pay nearly a thousand dollars for a phone, which is further than I'm willing to go any longer - we are essentially being asked to buy and keep current either a laptop or desktop computer [or both!], a tablet, and a smart phone, and of the three, I've found the smartphone to be the one I can most easily do without). None of these have quite the sound card that I would like. That said, these earbuds provide a remarkably clear sound. While I didn't get a deep bass sound listening to several of my favorite alt rock bands, I found that listening to several classical recordings on provided a wonderful clarity. While I spent most of my life on the cutting edge of rock music, I am just old enough that I was never able to enjoy or appreciate most rap artists. I even wanted to, especially after reading Jeff Chang's essential CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP: A HISTORY OF THE HIP-HOP GENERATION, but even after listening repeatedly to the Danger Mouse mash up album THE GRAY ALBUM, I have failed to find what is compelling about rap. I don't doubt that it can be great (just as I also do not doubt that there is little good in all those booty rap numbers). But the reason I bring up rap is the fact that there is so much inner detailing in the music that I think I could listen to rap and get all the lyrics, something that I don't even manage to do in rock. The clarity in these earbuds is striking. I listen to things constantly with these, nearly all on my Kindle Fire. I listen to a bunch of Youtube videos, catch up on TV episodes on the CW online, watch various things on Netflix and Amazon Prime, watch a few shows on FOX, ABC, NBC, and CBS online, and listen to a ton of things on Spotify. The great thing about these earbuds is that I simply forget I am wearing them. I fall asleep wearing them and wake up seven hours later, with them still nicely in place with no fatigue or discomfort.

Let me put it this way: these are both the best sounding earbuds I've ever had, but just as importantly they are the most comfortable.

I also want to praise the case that these come in. I've had a number of pairs of wireless earbuds and a major problem I've had is having the two become separated or having one of them sustain damage. The case for these earbuds is the most protective that I've seen. But it is also the most convenient that I've seen. You can easily put the case in your pocket and carry them around for hours without really noticing that they are there. The literature that comes with the earbuds claims that they last 5 hours, but I've easily gone 8 hours. Now, there is a chance that as they age it will drop to 5 hours, but this one of the few times when the product has outperformed what the manufacturer has claimed for them. The case also is a recharger, so that when you store them as you go from one location to another, the case recharges the earbuds. I love that when you put the earbuds in the case and hook the unit up to a USB cable, it charges both the case and the earbuds.

I have for some time now been a pretty severe critic of wireless earbuds, but these are the ones that have changed my mind. As a reviewer for Amazon I often get earphones or headphones or earbuds that I simply don't need, so I'll give them to my daughter or my brother or another relative. But no one is getting these earbuds but me. Each night when I go to bed I take care to hook up to my USB 3.0 hub that I keep on top of my night stand. I put only a few crucial items on them hub, but now these earbuds have earned a permanent place on top of my night stand. In short, if you need a pair of wireless earbuds, I can't think of a single pair that I recommend more strongly. A huge thumb's up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For me these are a perfect 5 stars. The sound quality is great (I appreciate good quality sound although I am not an audiophile) - I have had a variety of headphones and earbuds through the years and these rank exceptionally. I originally got these over the airpods because the airpods keep falling out of my ears and my right airpod has broken twice now, the second time was out of warranty.

These sound better than the airpods, are more comfortable, and if you have bigger ears like me - they stay in your ears! I also like that I can have multiple devices connected to it and I do not have to reconnect/disconnect.

The only slight downside is that the case is not magnetic. Also note, if you're using a Mac - mac doesn't default these to AAC. You have to download bluetooth explorer (Additional Tools.dmg from mac developer tool website) and enable AAC. This is true for every non-airpod device I've connected to mac over the years  - Macs dont seem to do a great job at figuring out codecs other than the airpods.

Unlike most reviewers here, my primary interest is not in the sound quality while playing music, although that’s certainly important as well.  Rather, I’m looking for a moderately priced Bluetooth headset for making and receiving calls, both in the office and while outside and in a moving vehicle.  Important factors, to me, are my ability to hear the caller on the other end, the ability for the caller to clearly hear me, and the ability of the headset to block out background noise so that the person on the other end can hear me clearly.

For the past year I’ve been using the Taotronics TT-BH026.  It’s a decent headset, with nice sound quality on my end.  However, in recent months I’m finding that I need to take more calls outside and in the car, and that’s where the Taotronics falls short.  It does a good job of cancelling background noise, but also cancels my voice in the process.  The end result is that the person on the other end of the call can’t hear me.  So, after some research, I decided to try the Jabra Elite 65t.  After a day of real-world use, here are my initial observations:

The Jabra is a clear improvement over the Taotronics. On my commute this morning I made a series of calls to my voicemail, using a) the Taotronics, b) the Jabra, and c) just the phone (Google Pixel 2XL) by itself.  When I reached the office I made a call to my voicemail using the headset on my desk phone.

End result is that the Pixel, by itself, has the best call clarity. Of course it has $1000 worth of fancy noise canceling microphones and 1.5GHz of CPU power behind it, so I'd expect that. The Jabra, and desk phone headset, were nearly equal in a quiet environment. The Taotronics had volume issues unless I yell.  And it sounds very muffled in all circumstances. When I speak fast, or not at full volume, the words blur together.  The Jabra doesn’t have that limitation.

In terms of noise cancelling, the old and new headsets are not hugely different. Background noise still comes through, but in different ways. The Taotronics kind of blurs the background noise, but slightly blurs the speech at the same time. On the Jabra the background noise comes through, but with less overall distortion of everything.  I had no trouble hearing and understanding speech on the Jabra.  Retesting in a quiet environment confirmed those results across the board.

Other things that I like:
1) The sound pass-through functionality is nice.  Some reviewers like it, and some hate it.  I like it.
2) The companion app has a number of equalizer and white noise functions that I like quite a bit.
3) I had no trouble pairing.  It was paired, and up and running, in seconds.
4) Sound quality for music is solid.  The equalizer works very well.
5) People on calls are no longer asking me to repeat myself!
6) Love the fact that they turn on, and pair to your phone, when you take them out of their charging case.  By the time you get them into your ears, they are ready to go.  Of course I only figured this out after I repeatedly turned them off while trying to turn them on after putting them in my ears.  More on documentation later…
7) Love the fact that they can be configured to pause sound/mute call when you take one out of your ear, and resume when you put it back in.
8) The earbuds are comfortable in the ear, after you experiment with the different size silicone tips.  They come pre-installed with the small tips.  I tried the largest tips, which fit better, but were a bit painful after a while.  Now on to the medium tips, which are just right.
9) LOVE that I can have them connected to multiple devices simultaneously.  As I type this, they are connected to both my phone and my computer.  I can take a call on the phone, hang up, and place a Slack or Teams or WebEx call on the computer without having to touch or switch anything.  It just happens.  Love that.

Things I’m not as excited about:

1) These little suckers are slippery!  Trying to get hold of them to pull them out of their charging case, and trying to hold onto them to put them in your ears, is a challenge until you get used to it.
2) Some reviewers have noted that you have to push hard enough on the volume buttons that you push the earbud into your ear canal.  I found the same to be true at first.  But after a bit of familiarity, I found that you don’t have to push nearly as hard if you push in just the right spot at the right angle.  It just takes some practice.
3) Ok, here’s the weird one.  Getting the charging case open takes some practice.  It’s nearly impossible to get open until you discover that you have to squeeze the sides of the main part of the case, and press upward on the lid at the same time.  I guess it’s supposed to prevent the lid from popping open accidentally.  But the documentation should tell me the secret.  Oh, the documentation.  Again, more on that later…
4) There are 4 Jabra apps in the Google Play store.  Which one works with this headset?  Hey, install them all, and try them all, until you find the one that lists the Jabra Elite 65t.  Seriously?  The documentation should give some guidance.  Or give me a QR code on the package that I can scan.
5) About that documentation… that’s the biggest issue here.  There is none.  At least none that is usable.  This is very much a “figure it out your own damned self” situation.  I’m extremely tech savvy.  I never read the documentation unless I need to.  But come on, guys, at least give me a head start here.  The booklet that comes with these things has 3 relatively meaningless pictures, and no accompanying text.  After you find the appropriate application, and dig through it far enough, you find another 3-4 cryptic pictures, and again no text.  I’m starting to figure this thing out, but it really shouldn’t be this hard.

Overall, the Jabra Elite 65t is a solid product, but with lacking informational infrastructure around it.  It’s a clear step up, has nice music sound quality, and does a decent job handling calls in both quiet and noisy environments.  I’ll be sticking with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit just isn't there and the only adjustment is increasingly uncomfortable silicone cups that make a loose fit an ear-canal plug that turns into a bass drum when running with them.

I didn't expect great sound from a b-tooth earbud so no issue there, it was as expected regardless of the hype.

I decided to return these earbuds not because of their overall quality, but because they did not fit my ears. Read on:

SOUND: 8/10
The sound is generally excellent. The earbuds have a great range - I like to test mine by playing ""Limit to Your Love"" by James Blake. I've found that when speakers are truly inferior you won't even be able to hear the bass at all. It deals with treble well, making something bright like Irish folk music sound almost live. As other reviewers have mentioned, in a quiet environment I noticed there was a low white-noise static particularly in the right earbud, but it didn't annoy me too much.

STYLE & FIT: 6/10
The earbuds are quite large and even though I wouldn't say my ears are small, I had a very hard time getting them to fit. It didn't make a difference which earbud tips I used, the earbud was too large to sit in my ear. I was able to get it to stay in place for about an hour if I fit them so that the microphone portion was angled basically straight downwards, which is not how they are supposed to seat and would likely have led to poor mic quality. They would work their way out of my ear in about an hour as my ear formed around them and then I would have to adjust them every few minutes or they would simply fall out. It didn't make a difference whether I was sitting still, moving my jaw, or tilting - it was really based on the initial fit vs. the ear relaxing after time. Stylistically, they do have a medium-large profile - not as much as some of the more expensive, large earbuds (Bose, Master & Dynamic), and overall didn't feel distracting. They are not particularly fashion-forward, but are on par with most of the decent ones out there.

VOICE QUALITY: x/10
I did not attempt any phone calls with these, so I can't rate the call quality.

FEATURES: 7/10
One of the best features ought to be the HearThrough, which will use the mics to pick up and amplify environmental sounds. Everything sounds a bit tinny this way, but you can still carry a conversation and feel like you're aware of your surroundings. Some noises it seems like the earbuds are fighting, actively cancelling some things out, and favoring more sudden noises or things that would sound like conversation. It's not particularly distracting, but it's obvious that they're not trying to pick up and amplify *all* the sounds around you. The controls make sense for the most part, although many of the controls are on the left earbud (volume, forward, back) and so you have to count seconds you press until you get used to it, because you can do 4 things by changing how long you press, including turning it off or putting it into pairing mode. The case is a good size, but Jabra is steering clear of the USB-C train, which is not flattering. We have a new standard, so there's not a good excuse to keep putting out microUSB products.

BATTERY LIFE: 10/10
I never drained the battery, but if you're using them typically there's no reason you should run out of battery unless you are intent on running them through a whole work day. Every time you put them in the case they charge, and the case has a great battery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_307?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=307&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The earbuds are great but the quality control is completely rubbish. At least of they didn't require me to return the first pair i could have kept the working ones from each pair and combined them for a fully functional pair and sent back the defective ones. I only hope the ones i bought my mom dont end up being defective as well, otherwise that'd make jabra 0/3.

I was very skeptical because of some people's bad reviews, so I spent days wondering if I should buy these or go with some competitor. But highly trusted tech reviews kept telling me these are the best. And, well... THEY ARE.

I have asked several people on the other side of a phone call how my voice sounds and they said it sounds even better than normally. Sound quality is CRISP and connection is instantaneous whenever I take them out of their case and put them in my ear. The bud recognizes if they are in an ear or not, so when you take them out it automatically pauses. There is also the awesome ability to have ""hear-through"" sound so you can hear the sounds around you (even amplify them) if someone start to talk to you while they are in. This is nice in an office space because you don't need to take them out. You just pause the song (single click) and then turn on the ""hear-through"" mode (double-click) and you can hear perfectly while they are still in your ears. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for awesome, true wireless, high-quality earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_321?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=321&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have yet to encounter a single issue/annoyance.

I've used Bragi's The Headphone before, and the Jabra Elite is way better than it.

- The buttons are very easy to press.
- The design is top notch (it has an expensive look)
- The fit is good.
- The UX is good (for example, earbuds automatically turn off / on when put in / taken out of the case).
- The battery life is great.
- No issues in connectivity/charging. It takes less than 2 hours to fully charge the earbuds and the case as advertised.

There is one small ""con"": At first, I thought there was a bug because there was no sound from the left bud whenever I power on the buds, and I had to repair the buds to my phone or put them into the charging case and take them out again. After checking out the manual, I now know that the left bud needs be turned on separately (by holding the volume down button for 1 sec).

tl;dr: Great overall wireless earbuds. Be sure to read the manual.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

• Battery life is great. With pretty consistent usage, I got 2-3 days usage out of the headphones/case battery before having to recharge.
• Connection strength with phone was great. I could walk several rooms away and still have an uninterrupted signal
• Fit for me was ideal. They never felt loose, but I could wear them for hours and not feel sore like some other earbuds. Your mileage may vary, but this was great for me.
• Sound isolation / sound cancelling was a good setup. When I wanted to be isolated, they did a great job of blocking out outside noise, but when I was running or in the office, I could leave the pass-through audio on. This is a killer feature.

The OK:
• Call quality on my end was good/clear. I definitely got a few complaints of sounding distant from the other end.
• Jabra service has to run fulltime in the background on your phone.

The really bad:
• Connection to the left earbud was beyond flakey. I would leriodically get a static type noise on the left earbud that actually started to hurt my ear after the 2nd or 3rd time. This happened consistently 10-15 times per hour of wearing the headphones. No matter how many times I reset, updated the firmware, charged everything up, or whatever else, this problem was constant. This is true across several phones too (iPhone and android, both with Bluetooth 5.0 capable hardware).
• Very fiddly if the right earbud connects while the left is still in the case. You'll often have to reset them both to get them to connect to each other.

If I could have fixed the static issues, I would have loved these headphones. The form factor, battery, audio quality and other features were ideal. That painful static and shakey connection between earbuds was just too much to handle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_308?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=308&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm so glad I lost them and that gave me a reason to buy these, which I'm so much happier with them. I thought from the pictures here that the 65t would be a bit too bulky in the case to fit nice in the pocket. It's not, the case is VERY small, almost as small as the AirPod case really. Cycling with AirPods worked pretty well but running was a real struggle since the AirPods were just so hard to keep snug in the ear and I was constantly pushing them back in. These Jabra 65t DON'T COME OUT or even get loose while I'm running. They stay put perfectly and stay real snug without a doubt. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I can't really comment on sound quality or the amount bass or whatever since I rarely listen to music on them, mostly podcasts and those sound fine. I said ""almost perfect"" in my subject line. These work VERY poorly when I'm inside my house. They're basically unusable in my house and the sound is pretty much constant static and audio dropouts as I move around my house. If I find a good spot and sit still, I can get good sound in my house but If I'm doing chores or something like that, forget it... they just have too much static. I still gave them 5 stars because I didn't buy them to wear around the house. They work just fine outdoors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found the AirPods to be decent and easy to integrate, but they didn't fit snugly in my ears (no way I could exercise with them) and wasn't very impressed with the sound.  Saw these on sale over Xmas and decided to give them a shot...

- Much better fit than AirPods. Could shake my head until I'm dizzy and they wouldn't budge. (they also come with s,m,l silicone tips for the ""perfect fit"").
- IMO the sound is better than AirPods, and I really like the ""Hear Through"" feature so you can hear your surroundings with them snugly in your ear.
- Battery life is pretty amazing.  I've been on 4 hr conference calls and never had the battery die.
- The range is amazing... I roam my office and other rooms with my phone on my desk.  Only dropped signal once and I must have been 50 ft. away with 5 walls between me and the phone.
- The case charges them 3x full capacity, and they fit easily and snugly in it.
- The App is actually pretty decent and presents several modes and features which can be customized, including EQ.

In my opinion, these beat the AirPods in every category.  Battery level is displayed in the app, and they're super easy to pair.

Really, the only ""downside"" is you don't get that ""cool"" pop-up on your iPhone when you open the case... but they do automatically re-pair, so who cares.  Also, they look better, and I'm told my audio sounds better than with the AirPods.

These aren't audiophile-level earbuds.  The sound is good, but they're just great wireless earbuds.  If you want audiophile-grade sound, get something with a cord.

TL;DR

I have a set of AirPods that I haven't used once since I bought these about a month ago.  Would recommend in a second.

I have been using them for a little over a year and have been extremely satisfied until now. I had the charging case tab snap on me from normal wear and tear. I expected a premium product to have premium service, and since the product hasnt been abused, a replacement charging case to be provided. I am still working with their customer service, but so far, no luck. This experience has this overall great product sitting at 3 stars. I will upgrade/downgrade the rating based on how they handle this issue.
I truly believe that the manner in which a company handles issues is the best reflection of a product. The sound quality and features as shown below are wonderful:

Pros & Cons:
Look 5/5
Fit 4/5 - Fit perfectly in my ear, only comment is that the fit might be a hair to snug, I struggle to hear outside noise, even with the hear through active.
Sound 4/5 - Excellent sound
Charging Case 1/5 - This case is flimsy, and the tab broke on me. Since it is the only method of charging and not covered under a warranty, then you have to pay to replace the case if you want to use your headphones. I believe that a case is, honestly, part of the headphones and should be treated with the same warranty protections as the headphones themselves.
Controls 5/5 - These controls work fine for what I need. I agree that it would be nice to be able to do more with the controls but it does everything I need.
Pairing 5/5 - Honestly, I haven't had any issues. Occasional, after a couple of months, i have to re-pair the headphones but it is very infrequent.
Usability - 5/5 - I have been using these headphones consistently for a year and love them. I would estimate 4-6 hours a day of use.

I believe this is a 5 star product with a company that will do the right thing, but, until the case is included in warranty, I will not evaluate the product over 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have been using the earbuds both in the gym, around the house and  cutting the grass.  The earbuds work great.  They fit snugly and stay in during workouts or grass  cutting.  They connect as soon as they are in my ears.  Every once and a while there is a glitch in the audio, when my phone is in my cargo pants pockets and moving about briskly.  It is not often enough to be annoying, but I want to try to give a very accurate review.

Details:
When I first started using them, they were not  comfortable. Then I realized I did not have them positioned correctly in my ear.  The short bar needs to point downward for me to have optimal comfort.  Once I did this, then they are nearly unnoticeable.  I have used them for the entire battery charge.

Not sure they hold a charge as long as advertised, but they work for a good amount of time close to advertised.  I haven't measured it.

I really wanted to write this review mainly to help others.  I had used quality wired earbuds for years.  Recently I found I was  getting tangled up at the gym.  I decided to go wireless.  Aside from reading the reviews on Amazon, I also research in the technical forums. I found a few pair on Amazon that were in the $50 range with 5000 reviews of 5 stars.  I thought this must be the ones to buy.  However, none of them were verified users.  Seemed a little odd. These  earbuds are clearly not $50.  They are pricey.  Are they worth the money?  Well I feel they  are a  good starting point  to get into wireless.

Something the company may consider is creating a ""no frills"" package for them.  They come in an elegant, multi box, sleeved system that is beautiful. It is now working its way through the recycling process.

The buttons to raise/lower the volume requires a bit of a push, but  works fine.

I really like how it automatically connects when I remove them from the charging box and they tell me they are connected once they are in my ear.  I like how they automatically shut off when you put them in the charging box.  No  fiddling with  them.  Just remove from charging and put in the ears.

The microphone works much better than expected. Callers cannot tell any difference when I am using them vs. being on the phone normally.  I haven't used them in a high noise environment though.

The pass  through function works pretty good.  When you turn it on you  can hear people talking very easily. It is not perfect; in other words, it picks up  some of  the other ambient noise.  Not a big deal. You are not going to be listening to high quality sound when it is on, however.

I  doubt I could sleep with  them on a plane. A little bulky for that,  IMO.

They block out a lot of ambient noise when the pass through is turned off.  In fact, you cannot really hear someone talking to you unless it is quiet and you turn off the music.

I hope this is helpful.

Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the app you can actually chose 3 sound canceling options. If I’m on the street I need to have some noice getting through, but in the park it’s nice to be completely surrounded on your own exercise.

The problem was that the left piece stopped working after a few weeks! I wanted to go for a run and the left one did not turn on...very irritating. I could not fix the issue at the moment and decided to run without the headphones.

After looking up some information I tried to die out the headphones to see if a full charge would solve the issue. I could not die them out, since the battery life is really good, which is a luxury problem I would say. But I found out that the left piece was working again. And a few days later it stopped working again.

Now I found out what to do, if the left piece is not working, I need to put it in the charging case (included) for just a second. And then it works.

Not sure if this is normal.

But for now it does the job.

The sound is pretty good for such a small device. The battery life is outstanding.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_332?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=332&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And the fit was good right out of the box.  Securely fits in ears during light workout (sit ups, push ups, rowing machine & treadmill jogging).  In all honesty, they're not as comfortable and don't sound as nice as my $9.00 corded pair of Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphones RP-HJE120-K's (I've bought several pairs from Amazon).  If you don't mind a cord, I suggest you try these Panasonic's.  But there is a ""cool"" factor with these 65t wireless earbuds, especially when working out.  I'll probably use the 65t's for gym only, and continue to use the Panasonic's for my daily commute.

I was having difficulty updating the headset firmware via the Jabra app on my iPhone.  I kept getting a failure message.  The solution was to reset and re-pair the earbuds.  Here are the steps.
1.  Press and hold (10 seconds) the Multi-function button on the right earbud until the LED flashes purple.
2.  Go to bluetooth settings and delete (or forget) the previous Jabra earbuds.
3.  Then re-pair the earbuds with your smartphone. Important!  You need to delete (or forget) the previous Jabra earbuds before you re-pair.

I sweat a lot at the gym and have had issues with other earbuds staying in (don't even get me started on Apple's head phones and how often they fall out of my ears), however these stay put and I never have to adjust them mid-workout.  The controls are a bit backward (volume up/skip forward is the back button which is counter intuitive), but once you get used to them, they're fine.  Having them in for a couple of hours got uncomfortable, but I've got over the ear headphones for long listening sessions and my workouts are never more than 1 hour.  A month after I purchased these headphones, the sound driver in the left earbud died.  Literally all functions of the left earbud work EXCEPT for its ability to play music.  No amount of troubleshooting was able to fix this which was frustrating, however Amazon did come to the rescue and overnighted me a new pair.  I would not recommend you purchase these headphones due to their breaking in 1 month; 2/5 stars for the QC issues, otherwise 4 stars.

First and foremost, the sound quality is fantastic for something so compactly packaged.  I like to think of myself as somewhat of an audiophile, though I don’t have quite the refined ear of some of my colleagues who work as sound engineers. Nevertheless, even they were overwhelmed by the audio delivery of such a tiny device.

The pass through audio takes some getting used to - it provides an effective background soundscape that is of a far less quality than the audio files stored on my phone (obviously!), so you end up with a weird mix of high quality, heavily produced music playing in your ear, over a fervently high range and tinny version of the outside world.  It’s jarring for the initial few minutes, but something I have grown to greatly appreciate.  It can be turned on and off at the double tap of a button on your right ear, and is probably the function I use the most.  I feel much safer walking to a busy NYC subway knowing I can hear the traffic around me, but when I arrive on the platform it becomes a simple button press to remove the outside world and focus in on the song I want to listen to.  The difference is enormous, and shouldn’t be understated.

It also works well in an office environment, where I can now listen to music and readily hear when someone wants to talk to me.  Removing a single earpiece works wonders to cut the audio so I can properly engage, but it’s not impossible to hold a conversation even with both earpieces in (kinda makes it sound like the other person is talking to you with a handkerchief over their mouth, but for passing exchanges there’s little need to remove an earpiece... unless they’re softly spoken)!  More often than not, it gives me enough of an indication that I can whip one (or both) of the earpieces out of my ear when someone is approaching, and a proper conversation can take place (the auto shut off of the music when you remove one earpiece is instantaneous and incredibly helpful).

That being said, the microphones do pick up a area of sound far wider than your actual ears can, but then can’t do a great job of translating that into a surround scape (I think it’s still stereo, but feels largely mono).  So I have found myself in situations where someone is talking from behind my back or off to one side, and I could hear them as well as the person in front of me.  It’s occasionally confusing, and you lose a sense of which direction the sound is coming from.  I was at a cashier recently with the earpieces in, and didn’t realise the person in front of me was asking if I wanted a bag or not... I thought it was the cashier one station down, and just came across a little rude and inattentive!

Lastly, the comfort of these things feels largely hit or miss based on your ears.  The earpiece fits my right ear perfectly, and I could listen to it all day.  But the left earpiece hurts like hell after an hour+ of wearing.  The default padding is clearly too big, but the provided “small” padding is SO much smaller as to prove utterly ineffective.  I lose all ability for the piece to stay firmly in my ear at motion, and the outside world bleeds into my audio to a degree as if I wasn’t wearing the earpiece at all.  I would gladly fork over extra cash if I could get an ear cup that is sized between small and regular, but the difference between the small, standard and large earcups is so enormous as to negate any kind of fine selection.  It’s still early days though, and some other reviewers have stated that their ears managed to “get used” to the feeling of having these devices in there.  I hope that’s the case, because I love the sound and convenience so much.  I just don’t want to spend $200 to sit with an ear ache all day should I want to have an extended listening period.  I’m going to look into potential third party replacement earcups, and will circle back if I find something that works.

In summary - SUCH an incredible product, but it’s unbelievably frustrating that at this price level they weren’t able to provide 5 subtly different rubber earcup sizes instead of the 3 incredibly disperate ones.  Would that really have killed their overheads?  It’s certainly killing my left ear!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

WhYyYyyy I didn’t go for the AirPods (1) sound quality on the wired earphones are okay and assumed it would be the same without wires (2) the AirPods in my opinion are VERY douchebag looking. I am drawn to simplistic pieces and don’t have the desire to flash anything on me.

With that being said, the sound is AMAZING!!!  Treble, bass, you name it!

I sweated like a beast during my first half marathon and they did not slip, move and were not damaged from the moisture and sweat (salt) dripping everywhere.

Highly recommend.

Cons:  I still have trouble opening the case.  That just takes a bit of getting used to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Self proclaimed audiophile, and I prefer bluetooth headphones. I have owned every type of bluetooth headphones, and these hands down are the best I have owned.

Sound is solid, I use them for gym, jogs/walks with dog, and some everyday use. I really like the hear-through option, and I love that they stop playing when I take them out of my ear. No issues with drops and they connect the second I take them out of the case.

Only downside, and it may have been I wasn't thorough when I was looking at them they are navy/gold, I thought looking at the photos they were gray or black.

They worked so easily...put 'em in your ear and they turn on...take 'em out they turn off. They connected to my phone flawlessly everytime with no effort.

Recently I started noticing that the left earbud was considerably quieter than the right. I looked it up online and the are MANY, MANY people who have experienced the same thing. There are suggestions of updating the firmware, which I did and it didn't help. Some people had to send them back to Jabra for replacements and the new ones did the same thing.

The noise cancellation is good.
My one complaint is the noticeable delay when watching videos. It's not in sync with the speakers lips. My other bluetooth headphones (with a wired connection between the ears) doesn't have the problem. I've learned that all wireless earbuds have this issue because there's a bluetooth connection in only 1 and they use an NFMI chip to send data to the other one. That adds extra lag.

When I work near some equipment in my shop, I have to turn off the feature that pauses the headphones when one is removed, and the left still won't work.
The few responses I did get from customer service explained it was due to the magnetic connection between the two headphones, and that's just how it is. Luckily for me, I don't use the equipment often.
Again, I like them, but if I was trying to use these for reasonable periods of time near magnetic equipment (it can be more than you'd think!

That was very disappointing.

Even modest exercise, a brisk walk and the headphones need to be constantly adjusted so they don't fall out.  I can't imagine doing real exercise.  I vigorous bicycle ride and you almost certainly be stopping every few hundred yards to search for these on the ground or jamming them back in your ears.

Maybe I have odd shaped ears, I don;t know but these ""hurt"" to wear no matter how many different way to insert them.  I tried all three sizes of the ear buds but it did not seem to make a difference.

It turns out my dog liked them more than me.  I accidentally left them within his reach one day and he chewed one in to submission.  The only reason I was sad is because I felt like I had wasted the purchase price on something I wouldn't have used and could not longer return.

Sound quality is a little tin-y, but decent.  On a long, sweaty run, eventually my ears are full of sweat and I need to keep removing them and soaking up the sweat with my t-shirt, so they're not great for moisture wicking.  Noise cancellation is pretty good without it needing to be super-loud.  The charging/carrying case is great.  I can always find them in my purse.  They do the trick and are generally good.
The only issue I've had with them is that periodically the left bud just doesn't work.  If I put them back in the case and close it, making sure the charging prongs inside the case make contact, it usually gets it to work.  But it is annoying when I'm needing to make a call and I don't have the time to go through that rigamarole.

I have worn these on several runs and they have fallen out of at least one ear each time. On one occasion, one earbud ended up in some grass and it took me a while to find it. I thought it was gone forever. I've tried the other ear tips to get a tighter fit but the larger ones make my ears hurt. Mowing the grass, vacuuming the house, etc... these are great. But for running or cycling, forget about it. You're going to lose one.

Very few dropouts.
My major complaint is the music quality.  Reading these reviews I was led to believe to the bass quality of music was impressive. Not only is it poor, but overall frequency response is poor, making the music sound like an AM radio.
I know they are much bigger, and over the ear, but compared to the Bose QC's, these are way way off.

They charge up super fast (and the charger itself acts as a portable battery pack, so you can recharge the earbuds on the go). Instruction manual says they have a 5-hour battery life, and so far that's been my experience (although I've only run them down once so far). Pairing these earbuds with my phone and computer was a snap.

I popped 'em in and went out to mow the lawn. It's not super active, but the constant plodding along while I'm sweating in the sun usually bounces other earbuds out of my ears -- these ones stayed put. I just used the default ear-cone things (although they give you a couple others in different sizes, in case your ear-holes are bigger or smaller than average). The seated snugly in my ear and made a good seal without feeling like they were suctioned to my eardrum. And after an hour of wearing them, my ear was still feeling fine.

Music quality was great, at least as far as earbuds are concerned. Crisp, clear, good range (although bass wasn't any better than you'd expect from a set of small earbuds). Perfect for listening while you're out for a walk/run/mowing the lawn.

My one complaint (which I didn't take off a star for, because this isn't why most people will buy these) is that phone call quality is pretty mediocre. It's on par with every other Jabra bluetooth phone headset, but that's basically the result of bluetooth comms being pretty bad in general. My friend said I sounded like I was on a bluetooth headset, but he didn't have any trouble hearing or understanding me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound is darn good; better than most anything I've used save for actual noise-cancelling phones, which these are not.

Main complaint is that the left ear bud sometimes doesn't sync.  The solution is to return them to the case.  I've read that you then have to also charge the case but that's not been necessary.

Lesser complaint is that the Jabra Sound+ app is awkward.  You have to actually go through the pairing of buds with phone via the app if you want to use the meat of the app.  IOW, if you know how to sync with your phone and skip that first step in the app, then you cannot move forward into the actual app.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_340?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=340&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My last pair of SoundSport Wireless, which I think are great, started to have battery problems after about a year plus. So I decided to try something different since I read several complaints about batteries concerning Bose.

Although these are very comfortable, they aren't as comfortable as the Bose SoundSport Wireless. I think the biggest difference is that Bose's headphones doesn't create a seal inside your ear where you feel the pressure difference, they just sit inside your ear comfortably. These create a seal, but that is necessary so that they can stay in. Bose uses the winglets which may get uncomfortable on extremely long runs.

Sound is great, the hear-through is also great. I have gone on very long runs and they are comfortable throughout. I have never experienced any dropped audio like some of the reviews I have read. I haven't tested the battery life to ensure it meets the advertised capacity, but I like that the case recharges them. So after a few runs, I'll plug in the case for recharging, whereas with the Bose SoundSports, I would have to recharge every night, and if I unplugged them at night, the morning of they would be at 50% (this was not the case when they were new, just the last few months of owning them).

Overall, I was skeptical that I would like these, but I am a big fan now. Again, if you asked me which ones I would recommend, Bose SoundSport Wireless or these Jabra Elite Active, I would recommend the Bose first, as long as you were good with them possibly only lasting a little over a year. But if you wanted absolutely no chord, then these are great. No idea if in a year I'll have the same battery problems, but we'll see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_309?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=309&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love the sound quality. It weighs light and no burden for my ears at all. Five stars.

[Update]: The bass is farily good when I use a small gel.

I would think the sound quality should be better as a $150 earbuds. The tremble and middle are very good but the bass is insufficient even though I enhanced the Bass on the APP. You know, it won't work as physically it is not built to provide a better bass.

Overall, it is a great earbuds. Fast connection. When I placed it in my ear, it got connected already. It stayed in my ear firmly even when running. It is light and I don't feel any burden. But I would feel tried when wearing it for over 2 hours after a moving. I just think my ears need fresh air. I don't see any water resistence issue.

I am not so care about the noise cancellation when listening. I do care more about microphone cancellation as having a lot of conference call. I want to have a clear voice passed to others. I haven't tested it in a noisy environment (will do it later). But at home the microphone works quite well.

Just bought these last week and was excited.  Figuring out some of the  nuances isn't that difficult; the app seems serviceable.  They sound great, albeit I wish they would produce a little more volume.  When functioning properly, people on other end of my phone calls say that it sounds great (as long as there isn't too much background noise.).  The problem lies in the connectivity.  I cannot move move my phone (Samsung Galaxy Edge S8+) more five to six feet from the headphones without quality and connection significantly deteriorating.  For example, last night I simply slipped my phone into the pocket of my pants and the connection crackled and the other party on my call could not hear me. This phenomenon seems to be inconsistent as about 50% of the time I have been able to put the phone in my pocket without issues.  Same thing when I am stationary -- if I put my phone on my desk and walk away, then the connection pretty much immediately starts to crackle and becomes completely inaudible anywhere between five feet and 10 feet.  For what it is worth, I have had my phone for over a year and it has maintained bluetooth connections with dozens of products and never has had any connectivity problems.  What good is having wireless headphones if you literally have to hold the phone around your upper body for the headphones to work?  These will definitely be going back today.  Maybe I will give them one more chance in hopes that I just got a faulty pair.  Would love to hear from anyone else that has ever had a similar problem.

Post Script: I've now spent time reading other reviews and have run across other mentions of the connectivity being weak inside of 10 feet.  I've also noticed that Jabra comments on many of these reviews that the the experience the reviewer is having is ""not typical"".  When 20%+ of the reviews are already 1-star and 2-stars with many of the same issues, I think I would consider a different approach than telling everyone that their experience is 'not typical'.  It appears very 'typical'.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_263?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=263&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is great.  The mic quality for calls is pretty mediocre.  It works fine, but you sound like you're talking on a mic from 2007.

The form factor is what makes them so great (along with the quality).  Do you ever go 5 hours listening to headphone straight?  I don't.  I get up to do something, I talk to someone, I take them out from fatigue. Every time you take them out, what do you do?  You pop them in the case, and what does that do? It charges them.  So, for most people, they'll literally last 15 hours without having to think about charging them.  I've had mine for a year and they have literally never run out of charge.  There's a little LED on the case that lights up green orange or red to let you know the charge capacity on the case... once it hits read, drop it on USB for an hour, bam, back in business.  I charge my headphones like once every 3 days.  You'd be surprised how long 15 hours lasts in real usage.

Combine that with auto-connecting with my phone and laptop when I take them out of the case, plus auto-pausing when I take them out of my ear, plus audio controls.... these things feel like I'm living in the future.

The best part is probably that they don't look ridiculous like airpods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_402?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=402&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Again, this product sucks. The product is marketed brilliantly but offers nothing else. Overpromising and under-delivering. I got sucked-In, I hope that you don’t happen to you as well. I’ve had this product for less than 10 hours and I’m already turning it to Amazon. I had such high hopes for this product. Here’s what sucks: weak volume, virtually no bass as many people mentioned in other reviews, dropped reception, issues with the left ear bud as many people have mentioned in reviews, and no manual included with the product. Seriously, I’m just amazed that people are willing to overlook such poor sound quality to have basically a wireless headset for phone usage. The phone reception was OK although I have nothing really to compare it to. But if you think for second that you’re gonna be happy with an extremely inferior music sound quality just to have a few phone calls and look kind of hip with some interesting new design for ear buds for $200, you’re kidding yourself. This is my first Amazon review, and I felt really compelled to write it because I think it’s insulting that they sell a product like this for this amount of money.  Having read probably 50 reviews on Amazon about this product, I’m realizing that many are willing to overlook the dozens of negative comments about the sound quality and the fact that there’s an issue with the left earbud. I was hoping for the best. Well, I’m returning it. I guess I’ll try the Apple earbuds or whatever they’re called and see what they feel and sound like. The only good note is that I like the design, and they do fit well in my ears but beyond that why don’t I just shove part in my ears. Also, you hear lots of sound so there is basically no sound reduction. #sucks","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Jabra is an international audio and sound company that has been in business over 100 years and has an impressive website. This earbud kit represents the design wisdom that has accumulated over the years at Jabra. The product arrived in perfect condition. The well-designed and organized box in which the earbuds, carrycase/charger, and the USB charging cable arrived along with brief paper instructions is a keeper. I found the box even better made than the high quality product boxes used by Apple. There is a FREE Jabra App on the Apple App Store which I downloaded to my iPhone. This App opened flawlessly and provides a more detailed user manual and also provides a very basic equalizer to adjust your sound in a range of 700 to 10,000 Hz. The App also helped with setting up my Bluetooth coupling to the earbuds. Enough of this background discussion, Let's move on to the sound quality.

The Jabra Elite 65t fit to my ears reasonably well and pretty much eliminated background noise. The Bluetooth reception from my audio library on my iPhone is amazing: crystal sharp, responsive, and a listening pleasure on a wide assortment of music genres: classical, pop, blues, Cajun, and much more. I love the personal nature of the listening experience and the ease of operation. The earbuds synchronized flawlessly to the Bluetooth signal. They sound better than a pair of wired name brand earbuds that I have been using for three years, I enjoy the fast response, clear sound, volume control on left earbud which controls volume on both earbuds simultaneously, and the on/off switch on the right  earbud. I like the look of the earbuds as well. The only shortcoming so far discovered is that I am having a hard time trying to change the silicon rubber insert to better fit my ear. But, I know that Jabra will help out here and there are YouTube videos which may help me better understand some nuances of using the product.

The charging/storage case is a work of industrial art. It is easy to use and I charged it with an Apple 5v charger. The case opens by lightly depressing the edge. Various color lights indicate items like charging status, etc as explained in the instructions.

I have not yet tried using the microphone portion of the earbuds for phone calls as I prefer to use the iPhone mike. But, I think I will get to like the earbud mike after a few uses. Also, I have had the earbuds in for two hours and did get a little achy in left ear. I think a smaller silicon fitting will solve the problem. Looking forward to enjoyable years of earbud audio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is fantastic! Everything sounds good so far - music, podcasts, audiobooks - and the range is great, too. My old Bluetooth headset had to be at max volume if I wanted to hear anything if I was outdoors, these I can set to about 35% and still hear everything! The seal is good, but not so tight that I feel unaware of road conditions when I'm on my bike. It does a good job of cutting out wind noise, which is a big plus.

If you make a lot of phonecalls on your headset, then these are definitely worth the money. Every other bluetooth headset mic I've used sounds like, at best, I'm yelling across the room at my phone, but the 65t's 4 mic system captures crisper sound than when I'm using the handset.

It has a lot of neat features, like automatically pausing and restarting audio when one of the ear pieces is removed, and the Jabra App is very useful (but not necessary, if you don't want to use it). I like that I can adjust the volume and change tracks without taking my phone out, and I'm surprised at how often I'm using Google Assistant now (considering that I almost never used it before).

As for cons, there are only 2: The fit is uncomfortable if you have small ears. They are designed to take up your entire ear cavity, so it pinches the crease inside of my left ear. It might be something I get used to, but after wearing it for 2 hours, it starts to feel bruised. The other issue is that the connection drops out whenever I open my refrigerator. I'm not sure why that is, but I was wearing them while cooking, and every time I opened the fridge, the sound went out. Luckily, it picks up right where I left off when I closed it, but I'm worried that it means I'll be dealing with a lot of environmental interference.

Overall, these are the best bluetooth headphones I've used - and I've used a bunch! They are also the most expensive, but if the warranty is to be believed, they should last a lot longer (none of my other headphones have lasted longer than a year).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_353?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=353&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like the sightly texture surface material - make them easy to handle without sliping out of my fingers. They are not too big, but not small. I think they look better to wear around than AirPods. I've searched for a true wireless solution that sounds better than AirPods without sacrificing voice call quality. The problem is AirPods in my experience are really hard to beat for voice call quality. But the AirPods' sound quality for music isn't what I want. Specifically, lack of noise isolation is a problem. The Jabra Elite Active 65t comes as close as I've found so far. The sound quality begins to approach the Master and Dynamic buds I tried.  It's better to my ear than the Bose. It's full, rich, and detailed with decent isolation of outside sounds - unless you turn on the ""Hear Through"" feature which is pretty slick. There are two problems.

1. Fit - my ear canals seem to be right between Jabra's medium and large tips. I followed some advice I saw online and ordered foam tips made for the Jabra Elite Sport. The medium size works great for my right ear but it's ever to slightly too small for the left. But the seal is good enough that they make the Active 65t sound better to me than with the gel tips. And if the seal works for you, then disregard this problem.
2. Call quality - it's hit and miss. Sometimes I'm told it sounds just as good as the AirPods while I'm doing A-B tests with family members, better than any other non-AirPod option I've tested. Other times, mid-conversation and standing in the same spot they will tell me they cant hear me anymore??? The 65t also seems to pick up more ambient sounds than the AirPods do.

The case is nice and small (yet about 2x the size of the AirPods case) and has the same non-slip surface as the buds. The app for iPhone works well and gives a lot of options for customizing the sound.

Overall, if not for having experience with AirPods these would seem fantastic to me. As it is, they seem like a close second for my purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_400?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=400&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Update 092418
Still really enjoying them but I have a couple complaints.  The left ear piece seems to get static of varying levels.  Sometimes it's completely non-existent, then slight background but noticeable and on occasion it's terrible.  Secondly the case that charges it does a good job but is very slick.

I thought they worked pretty well, when they worked. However, the support has been nothing short of awful. Right earbud stopped working ~60 days after purchase. No big deal - things happen. I email support, no answer. I call them a day after that, the guy says fill out the warranty replacement request and we'll ship it out right away. I do that (including Amazon order #, etc). About a week passes.....crickets. I email again, no answer. 14 days later I get another email saying they want a picture of the earbuds with the case?!. Sure feels like I am getting the runaround from support. So far it's been 16 days since the original request and the replacement hasn't even shipped. I find this pretty ridiculous and I expect way better from a product at this price level. It certainly wasn't a problem to ship them to me when I bought them.

Summary: earbuds are fine if they work. If you have a problem, doesn't look like the company is interested in keeping it's customers happy, but more interested in delay tactics. Up to you if you think it's a risk worth taking. Keep a set of spares around.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After reading many reviews online and on YouTube, I made the decision to purchase the Jabra Elite Active 65t Alexa Enabled True Wireless Sports Earbuds and I am delighted with my purchase.

I paired my Jabras very easily with my iPhone Xs and configured my settings on the Jabra Sound+ app (downloaded from the App Store). The earbuds fit very comfortably in my ear (I need to use the largest tips provided) and provide a tight enough seal to block out a lot of extraneous background noise, which helps the sound cancelling nature of these earbuds. When the earbuds are set to ""HearThrough,"" you have the option of allowing more sound in to be able to hear sounds around you more effectively, should you need/want it.

The sound quality is excellent with music, spoken word (podcasts and audio books) and also with phone calls. As for phone calls, when you receive a call, the number or person's name is announced (if in your contacts) and gives you the option of answering or ignoring the call. The caller sounds very clear to me and when I ask the person I am speaking with if they can hear me well, they always say they can.

The carrying case keeps the earbuds safe and charged up. There is an indicator light inside and outside the case to show the battery levels on the earbuds and the case itself. When I take the earbuds out of my ear, my iPhone automatically stops and will resume again from where I left off with a press of the right earbud. The right and left earbuds have different controls which you can learn from the Jabra Sound + app.

I use the Jabras at the gym and have found no issues with connectivity or staying put during sweaty workouts. I do not have to be right next to my iPhone in order for the earbuds to be connected.

My only complaint is that I cannot connect my Jabra earbuds to both my iPhone and laptop. If I wanted to connect my earbuds to my laptop I would have to unpair from the iPhone first and then connect to the laptop. This is not a huge issue for me, but I wanted to mention it in case people want to have multiple devices connected simultaneously.

I found what I was looking for with the Jabra Elite Active 65t Alexa Enabled True Wireless Sports Earbuds: great sound quality, comfort and ease of use. I recommend the Jabras very highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Battery life is the best for wireless so far (not sure about airpods, but those don't even noise cancel). I can keep the volume on these very low and still hear everything while commuting! I love everything about these earphones even the voice prompts warning you that a call is coming. The only small criticism I have is that it took me quite long to find my fit, and I found out my ears are weird. (Left ear uses large silicone bud but my right uses a medium LOL). I am planning to try these with foam tips because i heard foam tips are even comfier! love the portability of the charging case too. I don't know why people say it snaps open, i have to pry mine open!  Battery indicator on the case for its battery and separate one on the top part for the earphones themselves is also so useful.

There is ear fatigue after a few hours. The Apple Airpods are the clear winners here with there elongated design.

Second, unlike the Apple Airpods where both the left and the right earbuds can be used independent of one another only the right side can be used on the Jabra Elites.

Third, there is a hissing static sound coming from the left earbud when talking which I feel is not a malfunction of the earbuds but the mechanics inside the earbuds working which can be a little distracting.

Fourth, the right and left earbuds cuts out randomly. A little too often in fact.

Fifth, phone calls are okay but unlike the Apple Airpods ambient noise can clearly be heard in the background by other callers.

Sixth, the Jabra Elites Active hear through feature is terrible. Best to turn that feature off and just use the one earbud.

Seventh, why isn't the earbud place holders magnetic to hold the earbuds in place?

Unfortunately, there is a problem that began as a rare intermittent cut-off of reception from my various Bluetooth devices that has turned into a full-blown, constantly repeating problem. The earphones always start off fine, then after they've been on for a while, they'll start to lose contact with the other device. It gets progressively worse until I just have to take them out of my ears and resort to my wired earphones. When I first got these, I used to recommend them to everyone who asked me for advice on true wireless earphones (Which is a lot of people since I'm pretty much considered THE gearhead among my social circle). Now I feel like I have to warn people off the 65ts because it's such a fundamental problem that I can't ignore it. I'm hoping to send them in to Jabra (they're still under warranty). Hopefully they can fix whatever the problem is.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had them 10 months, and have had minimum issues.  The sound, battery life, and convenience is top notch.
The only problem I have had is the left earbud not syncing with the right one after I remove BOTH earbuds and NOT putting them back in the case (putting them on a table).  This was easily resolved by putting BOTH earbuds back in the case, then putting them in my ears.  Kind of a PITA, but it resolved the issue.  Other than that, these earbuds have been great so far.  A co-worker has the exact same pair, and he loves them too.  They work great for us as earplugs in a high noise factory also.  All we have to do is double tap the right earbud to go from silence to hearing someone that we are talking to, then double tap back to silence.  Of coarse you can replace the ""silence"" with music from your phone... if your place of employment allows that.  But, just saying, they work great as work environment ear plugs also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't drop connection with my phone on the other side of the room. I even shower with them on and haven't had any issues with connectivity. However, in the gym it seems to be a different story. I am not sure what's causing the issues but whenever I try to lift weights. Such as bench press, overhead presses, etc. The connection constantly stutters. It's only while the weights are in my hands too. As soon as I put the weights down and rest between sets the connection is fine. I don't know what the cause could be but it's very annoying.

I also gave into to the earbud trend as headphones do mess your hair up and fall off/break easier. I was always udner the notion that they were superior to earbuds but apparently that has changed.

They are kinda big but not as uncomfortable as they look. For some reason the left one starts to bother a little more than the right over time. I do have to adjust a little but I end up finding a spot where they fit good and the sound is good as well. I do use these for workouts mostly and only adjust a little. I was fidgeting with them a lot the first day but I found once you actually get them in right the first time you really don't need to mess with them. The only time they fell off during a workout was cuz I was messing with them and/or did not put them in right.

A lot of people complaining about the left earbud's button push. I noticed it but figured a way to push the buttons without pain in the ear. You really have to hold it with your index finger on the button and your thumb supporing the bottom of the earbud so it doesn't jam into your ear. Problem solved. I just love the fact that it does change through tracks pretty quickly. The speaker, voice control and hearthrough are quite awesome features as well. The hearthrough really works!!

I thought the sound was just OK but then I played with the equalizer on my S8 as well as the Jabra app equalizer. The sound was very nice and allows you to control bass/treble, etc. I then tested it against my plug in earbuds (the ones that come with the S8 which are quite nice) as well as my Skull Candy bluetooth overear phones. These little guys are really really nice in quality. I didn't realize I was listening to such bad quality on my Skull Candy phones. They are crisp and really get you feeling the beats, etc. I don't have to crank the volume up as much either

I think mostly, I just have to keep wearing them to get used to the feel and the fit. Love that they do come with different size buds. I would give 4 1/2 but we can't do half stars. Only a half star off for some learning curve if you aren't used to this brand/size. Plus the fact of the buttons. Maybe they should have been touch but it's a minor inconvenience","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They sound great while offering good range, great battery life and some decent quality of life enhancements that not all devices like these have. For instance with the easily toggle-able external sound pass-through so I can hear my surroundings without needing to take the earpiece(s) out of my ear(s). Which brings me to my next favorite feature, the ability to use the right earpiece independently of the left and being able to seamlessly switch to using both and then back as necessary.

My only gripe is the microphone(s), people I call tend to complain that they can hear my surroundings more than when I use the built-in headset. Not sure what more can be done to improve this seeing as though the form-factor of these ear-pieces are so small already but it is slightly disappointing as I bought these with the intent of using them during most of my calls.

Have held up to heavy sweating too. Sometimes the left ear sound drops and buds have to be turned off then on again.
The biggest con to these is how easy they are disrupted when other electronics are close. In the gym is the worst. Anytime there's more than 6 or 7 people around with cell phones and headphones if thier own my phone can't be more than a couple feet away before there is extreme disruption. I tried both apple and Android phones but problem persists. I don't however have the issue with the Samsungs i have. I tried explaining to Jabra support but they weren't any help. Said turn them off then on if that doesn't work just live with it in so many words. Actually told me that would happen with any pair and didn't quite like that my Samsungs, which were half the price, didn't have the same issue. If you're an avid gym goer would say use something else for your music. Not worth the price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a pair of cheap buds that were connected by a wire....which would always stick on clothing.  For what they were they were OK.  I had been keeping an eye out for the perfect set of buds that I could afford and these checked all the boxes.  Sound is excellent especially when you can tweak it with the app (that I find somewhat useful).  The connection has been about 99%, with the rare glitch but MUCH better than anything I have used in the past.  Unobstructed range for me is about 50 feet or so.  Walls reduce distance dramatically as expected.  The bonus for me is call clarity.  I drive a LOT and most people on the other end cannot tell I am driving.  The passthrough feature is nice but I prefer my natural voice instead of processed so when using for phone calls I typically will use just the right bud.

Battery life has been great....haven't gone from full to empty in one sitting so I cannot verify five hour life.  As far as comfort, they fit my ears quite well.  I can understand that they could be uncomfortable for some which would be a bummer!

In general, they stay in but are liable to pop out without warning on me.

If I use these as headphones to talk while I drive, they let a lot of road noise through (caveat: I drive a loud sports car. My mom says my regular apple earphones do a better job of noise cancelling).

However- I REALLY appreciate the recharging capability if you put them back in the case!

The function buttons on head set take less effort ( push) to pause or raise volume. I had the Apples for a week & they were brutal, didn’t stay in ear & looked like a broken Q-tip in my ear- Not for me. All reviews point to Jabra as an Elite bud.
So here’s a quick pros & cons between the sports & Elite Active. ( just In case anyone’s wondering?) Actives go deeper in ear, (doesn’t bother me but may some) , easier to function, fully water proof. Biggest flaw is the case- pain to open and buds want to pop out when opened. Sports- less style, and Great/ easy charging case. Both sound awesome, comfortable & connect to Bluetooth flawless.

I cannot yet speak to the durability of these because I have only had them for a few months, but during sweaty workouts they stay in unbelievably well and I barely notice they are there.

The main reason I'm writing this review is to point our some differences between these and the less expensive Elite 65t (not the Active model). I was very skeptical of Jabra's marketing, because the products almost seem identical. I went through 2 pairs of the standard 65t Elite before finally deciding to purchase the Active version. There is a huge difference between the two models. My two other pairs failed after around 2 months, with issue most likely related to moisture. In both cases, one of the headphones just stopped working completely. So far, the Actives have outlasted in that regard. Secondly and most importantly to me, while the two models appear the same, there is a tackier coating on the Active model that absolutely makes a difference for keeping them in place during activities like running. I had to reposition Elite 65t every few minutes while running and the Actives need to be repositioned every 30 minutes or so during intense activity.

That said, if you are unsure which model to get, and plan on using them for workouts, save your time and get the Elite Active model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought these after I tried a competitor product, the Bose Sound Sport Free, mostly because of the pedigree of the name ""BOSE"". What a disappointment! The Bose were complete crap for countless reasons, but mostly because the community.bose.com support staff refuse to admit the problems this product obviously has, and it's real maddening watching them gaslight customers whose earbuds simply don't work.

Now let's talk about Jabra...

These pair easily on the first go. Whether it's to my phone (S8) or my computers, the pairing process was painless and it just worked. Contrast this to Bose, which would not pair to any computer I tried. It's an issue hundreds of Bose customers have, but their support staff deny that there is a problem. If you don't believe me, go look through the reviews here on Amazon, and take note when you hear someone complain about these not working with PCs.

It's hard not to talk about how bad my other experience was, to help highlight how GREAT the Jabras are. Another important plus: video syncs perfectly, with no perceptible lag. That's a big ticket item for these wire-free earbuds, and the Jabras perform flawlessly.

Another item is when the earbuds lose their communication to each other. Jabra handles this very gracefully, and you don't have to listen to a belabored error message voiced in the still-paired earbud while it looks for the other one. Having these in your ear, you can pull the left earbud out, and slowly draw it away from your head. At about 2ft it will lose the connection, automatically pausing your sound application. As you draw the earbud back closer to the right one again, toward your ear, it will re-pair, and unpause the audio. It's really fantastic, I can't stress enough how clear it is that Jabra did their homework making this product do the right thing. ROBUST!

They are light, and even though they don't have dedicated noise cancelling circuitry, their ergonomics do a great job being the right shape to naturally cup over my ear canal, and still feel very comfortable.

Audio quality is great. Disclaimer: I am not an audiophile, but I can hear when things clip, have low sample rates, or represent the sound source poorly in different frequency ranges.. These sound good and the companion app lets you specialize it all with a nice equalizer.

Don't be dumb. Buy them right now. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seemed like it had great reviews from every tech site.  I've been using these daily since November.  I really wanted to like these alot but now I've just gotten used to them and am stuck with them because I paid for them.  There are some solid pros but the cons have me depressed about these. So first with the pros:
Pros:
-Truly wireless. It is really nice not having to worry about wires getting caught or tugged.
-Functionality of button control. Real good ease of use with adjusting volume, answering calls, changing tracks
-Great for the gym. No worry about maneuvering your wires
-Battery life is actually really good. I usually have to charge the case once a week with the way I use them which is usually going to and from work and at the gym
-Mic quality is solid. People calling me have no trouble hearing me.

Now the dreaded cons:
1. The bluetooth quality sucks!!!!!! The connection keeps going in and out if the phone is in your pocket.  And it's very inconsistent. Doesn't matter what type of clothes material, pant pocket, jacket pocket.  And even if you have to hold your phone in your hand (which sucks in the winter), the swinging of your arm or if I turn my head will cause connection issues. This drives me nuts!!
2. Keeping these earbuds in for extended periods of time actually can start hurting my ears
3. The sound quality is mediocre at best. There is no bass in these headphones. I didn't realize it until I put on my wooden cased $30 headphones which have much better sound quality.
4. If you put the right ear bud on first, you have to really rush to put the left bud in. If not, then it only makes the right ear bud work. You gotta put it back in. Let it reset. And then try again. Its annoying.

I'm going to ride these out. Will use them exclusively at the gym. However, headphones are made to enjoy your music and I really can't with these headphones so will use my other wired headphones for my walks around the city. Won't buy these again unless they upgrade the connectivity issues and adjust the design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"1573054181-8856","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews","Excellent earbuds","As my first ""true wireless earbuds"", these have worked out great the first few days. Some things I've noticed:

1. Sound isolation. No one seems to mention this, but these isolate sound as well as some more expensive over the ear bose isolating headphones I've tried, probably because they form such a tight seal. The hear-through feature is really neat and does its job, but I almost wish it could be even more pronounced. I still had to turn the music down quite a bit to listen to conversations, but I'm spoiled to  the point where I would require some sort of ""hear-through"" feature on future headphones that isolate as well as these. Double-tapping the right earbud to initiate/turn off ""hear-through"" on earbuds is something I never knew I needed in my life until now.

2. Sound Quality. I'm not an audiophile but would rate these as ""good"". For reference I switch between wired Sennheiser HD 598 and Audio Technica M50x as my daily drivers. As expected with true wireless earbuds the soundstage doesn't begin to approach the Sennheisers, and the punchy richness isn't as detailed as the Audio Technicas. But they do sound better than my old Jaybird X2 bluetooth earphones, and the sound isolation these provide allowed me to focus on details I hadn't noticed before. They are crisp and clear, with a slight emphasis on the bass/low end and jabra has a great app that allows you to tweak the equalizer to presets such as speech, bass boost, treble boost, smooth, energize, or tweak it manually to your heart's desire, changing the EQ makes a bigger difference than anticipated. As a bonus, the Jabra app also has high quality ""soundscapes"" like ocean waves, cavern, rain, white noise etc. built in, a handy feature. Overall the Jabra app is definitely one of the better companion apps to all the headphone apps I've used, actually adding important functionality to the earbuds.

3. Call Quality. Testing these outside and inside with fairly minimal background noise, I've asked several callers how I sound and they say ""great"", one even remarked I sounded better than my cell phone. I can't say how these perform in noisy environments but in most typical settings these seem to perform above average.

4. Comfort. Several reviews mention these are super uncomfortable or don't fit their ear, I've had the opposite experience. They lock in like they were designed to perfectly accomodate my ears contours, and I don't have the slightest hesitation they'll fall out in vigorous workouts. They have definitely been fairly comfortable for me, even after hours of use. This seems to be the biggest random factor though depending on your ear's shape.

5. Build. These feel durable and I'm glad they went with a lighter, all plastic construction. They have an IP55 rating, meaning they are dust-resistant as well as resisting low-pressure water sprays. The buttons have raised ridges to raise/lower volume and are fairly tactile/easy to press. I don't like the feeling of using much pressure on the buttons to push even deeper in my ear canal, so slightly cushion them and press them ""away"" toward the top of my ear to relieve this feeling and has since not  been an issue. I definitely prefer buttons to 100% touch as they are easier/more responsive in my experience. The charging case is also nice and compact, and much smaller than other earbud cases I've researched, perfect for throwing in my pocket and taking anywhere.

Overall I would recommend these. After researching many brands, these check the most boxes for me as  one of the best ""all-around"" performers. They have good (probably not best sound quality), good call quality, a good bluetooth 5 connection, a good app, good water/dust protection, sound hear-through mode, good battery life, good  sound isolation, good control buttons, good design etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_267?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=267&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Maybe a little better. I like the look much better than airpods. One issue with the sound is that if you have the hear through option enabled, and you're not currently listening to anything or have something paused, it tends to skip sound for a second every minute or so. Also the casing is not the greatest. It feels like you have to put a bit of pressure on it to actually open and the tab for grip is pretty small. My brother bought this maybe a year ago and the tab on his case already wore off. It would have been much nicer if they just used a magnet to keep it closed. But the 2x charge of the case is pretty cool. The range for bluetooth seems pretty good also. Ive had this on at work connected to my computer and left my office to go down the hall to the kitchen and it was still working fine. All in all pretty good for the price.

And then trying to pair the two buds together.  That is not the case with Jabra Active elite 65t. These earbuds pair to my watch and each other first time every time.  I read one review where the person could not pair them to his Apple Watch. The Apple Watch 3 pairs fine.  I left one star off because when I only pair with the Watch the connection is not as strong.  I walk with just my Watch in the morning and listen to music from it. If I do not keep my arms halfway up, the connection breaks up and the music playback skips. So cannot walk with my arms down.

The sound quality is surprisingly good for earbuds. The bass is very good and you can really hear clear sound separation between instruments for these powered ear buds.

I never though I would enjoy my earbuds so much they are so small and convenient with such good sound quality i find myself bringing my ear buds to a lot more places than i normally would consider bringing them. For that reason i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good starter pair of wireless earbuds!

Light
Sound
Carrying case is cool
Excellent battery life
Easy bluetooth controls

It's absolutely infuriating to just be walking and then all of a sudden the music starts unbearable crackling, fuzzy, skipping forward in the track, etc.

I emailed Jabra's support, it took them days to get back to me, when I replied and told them all their resolution methods didn't work, they stopped responding. It's been 2 weeks since they've replied to me. I have no hope they are going to resolve this issue. So this seems to be almost $190 completely down the drain.

When they do work, i.e when I am sitting perfectly still or wearing them in my house. The sound is good and the battery seems to last a long time.

Personally, knowing that there is a small risk that your $190 ear buds might just not work all together, I'd skip on these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_277?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=277&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Easily bested by less expensive wired earbuds (Shure 215). Sound significantly better than Airpods. Isolation also significantly better. Jabra seems to fail when immersed within a strong WiFi signal. My left earbud significantly lowers in volume, crackles, and even cuts out completely when close to my home router Airport Express + Apple TV (3-5 feet) at home. This also happens at the office, where I work for an incredibly large company in a world class building with WiFi always at near peak performance everywhere for thousands of employees in the building. As I walk to my car, volume in the left earbud slowly improves to normal.

I’ve switched back to wired.

To me it just doesn’t go high enough, and I am one that gets into my workouts when the beats are bumping nice loud and crisp. I really wanted to keep these but the volume limitation is a deal breaker for me. Prior to this I was using the cheapo senso branded wireless headsets. They go pretty loud but they get distorted on some songs. I’d love to have that volume with the crisp clear sounds of this headset. I’ll be looking out for their next iteration and hopefully it can go much louder than the current one.

The Bose Soundsport headphones are quite a bit better in sound quality. The microphones work very well and the connection is quite strong!  The biggest issue I had with them was that I couldn't get a good fit with any of the ear gels and I have regular size, shaped ears. They would either be super uncomfortable with wearing more than an hour or with the bigger ones they would fit fine the way they are suppose to and then slowly slide out ,which is a lot more dangerous when you have no wires!

I was slightly skeptical as I tried the Jaybirds in the past and didn't like the fit and the video/sound sync was off.  These resolve ALL those issues and are great.  I can't use the Bose when mowing the yard as they stick way out of my ears and my ear protection doesn't fit.  These fit nicely in the ear with limited protrusions.  They sync easily to my phone and computer and I like how the app allows you to change the noise cancellation options.  When I have the full cancellation option on I can hear nothing (this has annoyed my wife tremendously when she has tried to talk to me in this mode.  There is no video/sound sync issue.  The only negative I have is I have sometimes dropped them when putting them in my ear as there is s specific way to do this and they can slip out.  But that is more my issues than Jabra's.

She had tried Apple airpods, but didn't like the feel of them, so we read reviews online and decided to try the Jabra elite 65t. We tested them out for a bit before ultimately deciding to return them.

Pros:
- easy setup, but not as good as apple airpods
- decent sound for playing music. we both agreed that the sound quality, although tinny sounding at first, was slightly better than airpods.
- multiple inner ear pieces to vary the fit.
- has an auto pause feature when you remove them from your ears. might be nice for some people but we all hated it so we turned it off

Cons:
- big and bulky. you have to cram it in your ears, and sort of wedge it in until it feels stable enough. even then, it feels like it would fall out if you did any quick motions with it. you also definitely can tell its there and it is very uncomfortable. definitely not as stable as airpods.
- everytime I put them on I have to remember which ear they go into, which is not obvious from shape until you get used to it. theres a little L and R on them but its hard to see, so I fumbled around a bunch each time I go to put them in. I don't have this problem with airpods.

in general it's not a bad set of headphones, but for the price you could just get airpods, and add one of those clear rubber earbud skins to make them fit better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ater less than 1 month of light use (and no moisture), they no longer connect when opening the case, and the left ear bud only connects 10% of the time. Currently, I can get it to connect by holding down a volume button, which seems to wake it up.

Good for Music..","These earbuds are advertised saying they have 4 microphones hence they are best for taking calls as they remove the wind noise. That's all a joke. I bought 1 pair of these and replaced them thinking it might have been a faulty unit but the new unit has exactly the same problem.

Pros
- Good for music and gym.
- Connectivity is good
- Small size is easy and convinient to carry
- Long battery life

Cons
- the call quality is horrible and when I say horrible I mean you cannot take calls with these if there are any noises in the background. Even if the noises in the background are minor, the microphones enhance that sound many fold that the person on the other end feels like you are in the middle of a war zone. I had to always switch back to the phone to take calls.
- the fit is also not meant for all ears since the shape of the earbuds have a unique shape that completely fills the ear. Hence if you have smaller ears, you won't be able to keep these on for more than an hour or two at a single stretch.

Overall I would say that if you just need these for music you can go for it but I would recommend going for something cheaper than this is music/gym is your only need.
If you want to also use these to sometimes take calls, don't buy these. I am still in search of truly wireless earbuds that are good for taking calls.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_404?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=404&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The method was pretty simple, but it may not work for all phones.  I downloaded an app from the playstore on the phone called Mono Bluetooth Router.  It was made for those applications that use a single Bluetooth in the ear speaker and mic to talk with hands free calls.  The main problem to play an FM broadcast radio, is that on a phone you almost always need the earphones (wired ones) plugged in to act as the antenna.  When that's done the phone automatically shunts the sound to the earphones, and not the speaker or any Bluetooth connection.  With the Mono Router installed, it captures that sound and ships ito to the Bluetooth device in this case the Jabra Earbuds.  The whole process took less than 10 minutes to finish.

Next, I looked up the Bluetooth connector on my LG OLED tv and connected it, again no problem and I got excellent sound from anything playing on the TV or streaming to it from my ROKU.  Pairing is easy you hold the button down on the right earbud for 3 seconds and search for the connection on your source device, phone, TV etcetera.  Then connect, and you'll hear the sound over the earbuds.  To change volume up or down press the button right or left on the left earbud and the volume changes.  I got an occasional minor dropout for a second maybe, but I don't think I have 5.0 Bluetooth on my phone probably 4.0 or less.  It did not seem to be a problem though especially if I was sitting and not walking around.  The charging case is very convenient, although a bit tricky to get the earbuds aligned right over the charging pins.  With the charging case you can charge the buds twice more for up to 15 hours before having to go back to the charger.

It came with a USB cable with a common connector (common because it's on my Kindle, my old flip phone, and even a rechargeable pepper mill I just reviewed).  Most people have the standard USB slot in a computer or other device or the plug adapter, so this device didn't come with one.  A little cheap on their part for such expensive buds, but OK, not a much needed.  The buds have microphones on each, and when wearing it suggests to turn them towards the front.  I felt the sound was a good as could be expected within the Bluetooth transmission.  If I had a good 5.0 device, it could probably be better.  A lot of money to spend on earbuds to be sure, but these are very well made, and the innovative charging case adds a lot of value there as well.  Comes with three extra sizes of ear inserts to give you the most comfortable fit possible.  Though solid, these are very light and I wore them for a few hours, watching anime and youtube videos with no discomfort.  Recommended if you like high end wireless sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_292?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=292&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had been eyeing them for quite awhile and when the price dropped momentariliy to $149, I instantly bought them. Two days later I returned them.

They looked good. They fit very well and were very comfortable. The issue was that there was constant dropout. I bought a cheaper set that had a much better sound than the Elite 65t (even with the app downloaded and use of the equalizer). The cheaper set always stayed connected (with the exception of a certain spot by my job where I knew it would drop).

This set would lose connection with the phone in my pocket. The whole point of purchasing them was so that I wouldn't have to pull my phone out of my pocket to change the volume or change songs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_278?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=278&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fit is perfect, don’t fall out while exercising, sound quality is great, and call quality was impressive, even while outside on a very windy day.
I’ve tried the Jaybird Run, and it doesn’t compare. The Jabra has better sound, better fit - even without fins, able to adjust the volume on the actual earbud - something most true wireless earbuds can’t do, 4 microphone technology, on phone calls the audio is in both ears, automatically pairs when you take it out of the case, can pair with multiple devices, buttons are easy to press - the buttons on the Jaybird were really hard to press, really pushed into my ear, and they are also much nicer looking, which is especially nice when walking out in public. And from what ive seen looking around, many of the flaws of the Jaybird are present in just about all other true wireless earbuds, even ones more expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Absolutely fantastic sound with my iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro.  Setup was very intuitive and quick, with the only confusion arising from the need to install the Jabra 65t app on my phone in order to complete the installation.  I have very large ear canals, so I was concerned that the standard medium silicone inserts would not fit well, but they actually worked out quite well.  In the end, I swapped the mediums our for the large cups, and I get an excellent seal and isolation, and they are comfortable enough that I can go for 2-3 hours with these buds inserted in my ears without being aware of the buds in my ears (can't say that about any other similar buds, which usually get painful after about an hour).

The sound quality is simply superb and rivals my older Etymotics buds (that I'm now retiring).  Volume controls are intuitive (on the left bud), and power/call control is on the right bud.  Yet again, a Jabra product that doesn't require the use of a user's manual.  I'm also a daily (happy) user of the flagship Jabra Engage 75 binaural headset -- my daily work headset -- and the build and sound quality of the Elite 65t is right up there with the Engage.

After (literally) decades of being a dedicated Sennheiser fan, I've now completely switched over to Jabra and feel that I am getting the greatest possible value for my money -- and a lot of money it is, as an early adopter ($600 for both the Engage and the Elite).

I reviewed many options and even though the reviews on the cheaper ones stated poor bass and low end quality I gave them a try. After a trial run on a few songs with prominent bass lines I decided to return the original purchase and went with the Jabra Elite based on multiple good reviews. Not disappointed in upgrading! If you want good sound quality these are a great option for the money.

I did want adjustable ear pieces so that ruled our the Apple AirPods. It would be nice if the Jabra came with a universal charge bank capability and magnetic seating in the case but overall these are a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_334?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=334&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was concerned about the fit, sound quality and the connectivity. These were on sale for$119 for Black Friday so I decided to take the plunge.

First of all the fit. While this headset looks a bit bulky it fits like a dream.  They are snug, secure, and don't even feel like they are there. This was my biggest concern. I used the gells that it shipped with, but there are 3 other choices.

The sound quality is very good. The bass is a little lacking, but it is pretty good. I had a problem with the volume being too low but it turned out to be an issue with a setting on my S8.

There are some issues with drop out, and that is probably the main reason I can't give 5 stars. I get drop outs every few minutes. I should note that I also get some drop out on my 2017 Hyundai sonata, though it does seem to drop out more with the headphones. It is somewhat annoying, but not that big of a problem for me personally.

Overall I am satisfied. They fit well, have decent sound quality, but have a few issues with drop outs, though perhaps no more than any other headset.

If you are looking for absolutely killer sound and no drop outs, this might not be for you, but for $119 I think they are well worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_321?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=321&reviewerType=all_reviews"

People tell me that they cannot hear my voice due to the loud surrounding noise. This is disappointing as Jabra's ads are promoting call qualities in noisy scenes but fails to deliver  in its selling point.

Right out of the box they look sleek and have a very low profile design and look good in the ears (unlike Apple’s Qtip terrible look) The charging case felt cheap and was a major letdown, for $170 dollars I expected a magnetically sealed case and as well to secure the earbuds in place while charging. The left earbud fit perfect however the right earbud just didn’t fit very well. I tried all the tips that came in the packaging and couldn’t get that snug feeling with the right earbud. They paired fairly easy to my iPhone XS Max and I had no issues pairing the earbuds. The sound quality was good, and much better than Apple’s AirPods. I downloaded the app and tweaked the sound quality which improved the overall experience.

While listening to music with my new Jabra Elite 65t the left earbud just stopped functioning and I could only hear music emitting from the right earbud. I removed the left earbud placed it back in my ear and nothing. I removed both earbuds placed them in the charging case and after repairing them I was back in business. This was a major disappointment and the first issue I had with the 65t.

At the gym, these earbuds wouldn’t stay snugged into the ear canal while lifting so if you made any facial expressions the earbuds would dislodge from the ear canal and you could hear the environment around you, from the overhead music being played at the gym, to people talking and all the equipment being used. I had to keep readjusting the earbuds and it got annoying very fast.

The call quality was good, but not great. You could hear the person clearly on the other end, but I was told I sounded like a robot and my voiced was muffled. After repeating myself several times during the phone call I had to disconnect from the Jabra Elite 65t and finish my conversation on my iPhone without the 65t.

If you spend $170 dollars on a pair of true wireless earbuds you expect, a working set of earbuds, decent phone call quality on both ends, and a good charging case that is magnetically sealed. The sound quality was good however it wasn’t $170 dollars good. I own a pair of Senso Bluetooth headphones which I bought on Amazon for $40 bucks and they sound just as good.

The Jabra Elite 65t are way overpriced for what they offer and how they perform. Do they sound better than Apple’s Airpods? Absolutely, but practically every Bluetooth or wireless earbuds sound better than Apple’s AirPods (expect Bose SoundSport free sound about the same) for $170 dollars and with all the connectivity issues that have been reported all over the internet along with the left earbud losing connectivity while I was using them was enough for me to return the Jabra Elite 65t.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_268?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=268&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Good quality music
- Decent build quality of headphones & charger

Cons:
- Painful to use after wearing for 1 hour, especially with glasses on.
- Useless when taking calls with a little background noise. To the recipient, background noise seems amplified compared to your voice. I can really only use it for calls in quiet conference rooms. Not in the car, on the streets, etc.

I’m impressed with the build quality and especially the sound quality. I feel like having the sound+ app is crucial to make the sound even better, depending on your preference.

Battery life was decent, I have never used them for the 5 hours consecutively so they haven’t died on me yet since I always put them back in the case. The ONLY problem with MY pair is that the left earphone keeps cutting off like every 3 minutes or so. It goes quiet for a quick second and comes back to line. But it makes the static noise as it does, becomes distracting. It also happens when I get into a certain position when laying down, and I tilt my head to the right, the left earbud sounds like a static tv.

I thought ""maybe I can wear them around the house, just not to the gym"". Nope! Still kept falling out albeit it took a few minutes more than at the gym.

Bottom Line: I paid way too much for these for the lackluster performance. I am not ruling out that the fitment issue is because I am a mutant or something. I didn't see where others had problems keeping them in so maybe its the size / shape of my ear canals.

Charger works well. Overall quite pleased","I am basing this review with these earbuds and a current Samsung note 8 using an android Oreo system.

Let me preface the review by stating that I have used multiple different headsets and am generally disappointed with the results of Bluetooth headsets. My current favorite is the LG HBS1100 for daily use. Although that headset gets equivocal reviews, I find that it is very convenient and has great reception. Sound quality is also excellent. I have not had issues with a retractable earbud nor had any failures. My major complaint with that headset is it does appear to have issues after about a year of constant use and it is not a ""forever"" headset.

I have also used the LG HBS912 which essentially is a less expensive version of the HBS1100.

For working out,LG - TONE Active HBS-850. That's the waterproof version of the LG Bluetooth

All of these headsets use a retractable earbud and a collar that sits on your neck. It has great reception and works well for my point of view. But wearing that collar certainly looks a little bit bizarre

I've been looking for a good pair of the wireless earbuds and have been following all of the reviews.

I tried a pair of the Samsung wireless but they only work with Samsung phones and are not universally accepted by all Bluetooth receivers.

I followed the recent Jabra headphones but found battery charge in the reviews were not great

I noticed many of the reviews on the set of wireless earbuds are when they were just released. They have come out with some firmware updates which have attempted to address many of the issues. Ultimately, I decided to take the plunge and buy these earbuds.

My overall experience is been excellent. I have read all of the negative reviews and from my point of view have not experienced any of major issue. The sound reception is quite good, and when using them inside an office or in a closed environment, people can hear me clearly. I often take conference calls from other persons or do telephonic consultations and while sitting in my office using these earbuds the people at the other end of the phone tell me can hear me clearly and the sound quality is good.

The hook up with regards to Bluetooth was quick and easy. Not only does it hook up to my cell phone, it connects to the Bluetooth on every device I own. The video sounded delay is nominal and when watching TV I can enjoy the Bluetooth transmission with only a very small amount of noise video difference..

Charging cases easy to use. I plug it in at night. When I'm not using the earphones there in the case in constantly recharging. When I do use them they hook immediately up to my phone on removal and it sinks without an issue.

I have not use them outside in conversations as I do appreciate sound noise would be a problem. Also, they are not waterproof but merely water resistant so I do not use them for working out. I have use them when listening to streaming radio and working in the yard. They are very good to use and very convenient. If someone calls me, they immediately switch to the phone mode and people can hear me quite well.

It does work very nicely with the Google app assistant. I have not been able to make it work with Alexa. However, it will work with Google and make phone calls, find locations, and all other Google app assistant uses.

The device gets four stars for the following reasons:

1.)  You can use the device with only a single ear piece. It is possible to go within the settings and make the right ear the dominant phone ear. Unfortunately, the sound control on these headsets is on the left ear piece. You can control overall device sound from the phone. But if the earpiece is set to a low volume, you need the left ear piece to control sound.

2.)  As other people have noted, to save power the system turns itself off if there is no signal or transmitted music or voice after period of time. Reconnecting is simple by simply pushing the button, but it would be nice if there was a method of keeping the earphone on at all times while it's in the ear.

3.) The charging device itself is somewhat bulky. I have not yet found an easy way to carry it without having this device look lumpy in my pocket. One wonders if there's not a simple way of having a clip or some attachment to allow you to hang it on something or if a smaller  case for simple storage would not be possible.

4.) When you get the headsets, they are not tuned for best sound. Within the Google system, it is possible to individually and personalize the earphones. I use that and got great results. Also, the Jabra app works but it is very rudimentary and most of the adjustments are not as good as simply using the Google custom sound features. I would suggest anyone buying these headphones to attempt to use the Google custom earphone feature that comes with the android operating system.

I have not had any of the issues of left right ear disconnect as noted by other reviewers. Also, I think the sound is quite good for listening to music and streaming podcasts. I do not use these if I'm listening to a dedicated stereo system and do not anticipate these would be used for evaluating the highest quality sound reproduction

If I had to summarize my experience to date, it would be enthusiastic but guarded. Anyone buying these headphones needs to understand they do require some adjustment either within the Google custom earphone app or using the job wrap. I have had absolutely no problems with Bluetooth immediately connecting and from a connection point of view they are perfect. The carrying case is somewhat inconvenient but it does afford the opportunity of recharging and long-term use. At the end of the day I simply put them in the case and recharge them overnight.

I cannot give a long-term review analysis as I have only had him for two weeks. However, if any issues do occur I will certainly be back to post my concerns.

If you are on the cusp and concerned about negative reviews, I would look at them as possible early firmware issues. When I got my earphones I updated the firmware which is very easy to do and I have not had any problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_268?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=268&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After six months of heavy use, I'm delighted to say it's one of the BEST purchases I've made.  I had never heard of Jabra, but it's staggering how much better these are than the Airpods, Samsung's Icon X, and the rest.  I hate sounding like a paid shill, but that's the truth.

So why are they better?

1.  Unlike the rest, these support multipoint - I can connect to several devices at once.  For example, I can stream music from my laptop and seamlessly take a call from my cell when it rings.
2. Aesthetically, these look way cooler than their competitors, from the dorky AirPods to the comically bulky Bose Soundsports.
3.  They fit more securely, charge faster, and have more color options than their competitors.
4. The battery life is superior, as well as the sound.  The only true wireless earbuds that sound better than the Jabras are from Sennheiser, but you lose all the other features and they cost way more.  The trade-off is not worth it.
5.  You have more microphones, so the sound quality is superior during phone conversations.
6.  The Jabra has more tactile controls, so you can do way more without reaching for your device.
7.  They have a much higher water/sweat resistance grading.
8.  They have every feature worth anything from the AirPods, such as Live Listen (called HearThrough on Jabra) and integration with digital assistants.  Jabra also has an excellent app with features like an equalizer, different modes, soothing sounds (thunderstorms, pink noise for sleeping, etc).

Possible drawbacks?

1.  Some competitors have great features Jabra lacks - Samsung's Icon X, for example, has 8GB of onboard storage, which frees up the need for a device at all!
2.  While the fit is very good, the Jabras could benefit from wingtips to be totally secure.  The Jabra Sport version has them, but I wouldn't recommend it because it's an older model, so the earbuds of the Sport aren't as good as the Elite.  For their next version, Jabra may want to consider including wingtips.
3.  The case really needs magnets.

All told, however, these are still the absolute best true wireless earphones on the market to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_308?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=308&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I previously used traditional wired apple earbuds so that the extent of my earbud experience. Given that, purchasing Jabras has been a huge boost in my overall quality of life.

Pros:
-Really good battery life, I was worried about this at first but I charge it maybe once or twice a week, and I use it quite frequently. Definitely lasts a lot longer than I thought, also charges very quickly.
-Sound quality is noticeably different from regular apple earbuds. I've been able to pick up new details in songs and it's been very enjoyable to listen through all of my favorite songs again.
-Fits very snuggly. The shape makes it so that you never have to worry about it falling out, great for exercise or movement.
-Very attractive design, when worn. It's not noticeable enough to be a centerpiece like the airpods but it still has enough prescnece to be noticed. A lot better for those who don't want to be as flashy but still value an attractive aesthetic.

Cons:
-The case feels cheap. The overall shape is a bit awkward to fit into pockets but mostly, the top of the case feels flimsy to use. I haven't had any issues yet but whenever I open the case, I can feel the material's shape change under pressure. Hard to describe but I suppose I just expected a bit more from the case given the high price of the product.
-Slight static like sound when taking them off. Nothing major, but again, something very minor that'll always be there. Although it won't make or break whether or not someone will buy it, it's still something I'd hope gets fixed.
-The sound system is not very flexible. The music stops playing on the left earbud once it's far away enough from the right one. As a result, you can't really share the earbuds with a friend and have both listening to it at the same time. Pretty annoying but it's fine if you don't have friends.

I'm sure there are more pros and cons but this is just what I've come up with on the top of my head. None of the cons would dissuade me personally from purchasing the product had I known beforehand. I don't have experience with other Bluetooth earbuds, but I still believe this is a very high-quality product. If you're an avid music listener and value sound quality and imrproved quality of life, I can whole heartedly reccomend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After emailing and calling another 2X I finally was connected with a supervisor via email. They have now given me a a store credit for the full price of the device (Elite 65t) or a replacement Elite Sport (I took the store credit to purchase a replacement Elite 65t).

Just a note that they can fix problems if you push... it just shouldn't have been as hard as it was to get them to address the problem. Jabra needs to work on providing their tier 1 support reps (probably a 3rd party company they outsource support to) with more tools to solve warranty/logistics/etc. problems. Also, for a tier 1 phone rep to say it takes 2 business days for a supervisor to review tells me that Jabra is not staffing supervisors with call center resources efficiently.

Final Comments: Okay product. Poor customer service.

Summary: Poorly Implemented US Customer Service:

Like everyone else, I placed a warranty claim for the Elite 65t black and they are currently on back order. While this happens, they have no ETA, no sympathy, and no solutions. I sent 2 emails via their web form (never got a reply to either) and called (spoke for 30 minutes) their phone support who promised a call back in 48 hours (it has now been 72+ hours).

In short, I've had to make warranty claims with Samsung, Apple, Google (HTC), Sony, and others over the years. I've never had a customer service team drop the ball as many times as they have in the past 3 weeks as Jabra. Shame on their inventory/logistics team, CSR leaders, and/or partners they've hired. While inventory mistakes/delays/outages happen, not communicating delays to customers and making them reach out to you while waiting for replacements is poor practice.

I'll note that their phone CSR even mentioned that the way they are treating customers is poor and they he had limited options to make it right. He said they were only allowed to give 10-20% discount coupons and really couldn't go ""above and beyond"" like he has with other company's CSR programs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_418?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=418&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fitment in the ear is great and no worries about them falling out while working out. Got the Gold colored version and they look great. Not too big in the ears and are comfortable. The case is small but found it to be a bit of a struggle to open at times. Not a deal breaker though. The sound on these are really good. The mic works very good as well but make sure when you answer a call to press the earpiece to answer. Otherwise if you answer the call from your phone, the sound won’t be clear for a second or two. Seems like the phone and earbuds don’t connect right away when you answer that way. But when answered from the earbud, it’s clear and loud right away. I can’t tell if my wife is talking from her phone or the earbuds it’s that clear. They’re also light weight in the ear and in storage case that fits easily in your pocket. Maybe even your small pocket of your jeans. Charging is pretty quick. I also like the app where you can tune the buds sound and the background noise amplifier so you can hear more of your surroundings or talk without having to remove the buds. Pretty cool.

I have not used it for phone calls yet and have had them for over a month. The left ear piece will stop working sometimes and that's because it isnt synced.

When carrying my phone in my back pocket,  which is preferable, the earbuds become unusable.  The second problem is sound quality, or lack thereof. There is a total lack of base response, even after loading the app, and trying every possible setting, there is no base to be found.

Everything about these headphones is competently made but does not blow me away. I found them an easy fit, unlike the sports edition which I cannot fit comfortably for any reason.

The sound on these is decent, won't blow you away. These are not audiophile equipment, nor should they be judged as such. They lose signal every once in a while like every BT device I've ever owned.

The worst part is the Jabra app. I am not even certain which of their many apps I'm supposed to be using. If I could adjust the filtering / real world balance with these, they might be real winners. Right now I'm using them for audiobooks, phone calls, and long walks with my daughter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Fit (5/5): Snug, comfortable fit that held up to a 5-mile run without ever becoming loose or falling out.
- Sound Quality (5/5): Excellent sound quality
- Bluetooth Connectivity (4.5/5): 2 brief episodes of Bluetooth connection loss (less than 2 seconds each) in 5+ hours of use.

The long:
I picked these up at Costco a few days ago and was a little apprehensive about them because several reviewers have mentioned unreliable bluetooth connection. But Costco's return policy makes trying them out virtual zero-risk, and since they were the only wireless earbuds they carried, I decided to give them a whirl. So far, I've had a very positive experience with the product:

Fit (5/5):
These earbuds are the ""earplug"" style (as opposed to the hanging, loose earbud style of Airpods). The earplug style buds have always fit my ears better than Airpods and the like, which fall out of my ears with even modest head movements. In contrast, these earbuds held firmly yet comfortably in my ears for a 5-mile run. They also come with different sized plugs, which helps get the right fit.

Sound Quality (5/5):
Really happy with the sound quality. Nice, full-bodied sound. The only thing I've noticed is that deep bass doesn't come through fully, but I've literally never had earbuds that managed to deliver bass well, and I think that's just a limitation of the small size.

Bluetooth Connectivity (4.5/5):
Other reviewers mentioned the connection dropping frequently, which was my primary concern in buying the product. So far, in 5+ hours of use, it dropped very briefly 2 times for less than 2 seconds each time and spontaneously reconnected. Not perfect, but certainly not a dealbreaker. It also doesn't seem to be related to distance, as both drops happened with my phone in my hand. Conversely, I had my phone connected to a charger in my room and was able to walk freely around my (admittedly small) house without any drops in connection. So it seems to maintain connection over a pretty good distance.

Ease of Use/Ease of setup (4.5/5):
The setup was exceptionally easy. Like 2 steps and 60 seconds of work, and you're good to go. Using the product is pretty simple too; my only issue is that the buttons on the left earbud are fairly small and I find myself fumbling around trying to hit the correct button. They do have small, raised dots on each button that act as tactile guides, but they are very small. It would be nice if the whole button were slightly raised to make locating it easier. Or maybe I'm just ill-coordinated.

Longevity/Durability (???/5):
To be determined. I have not owned them long enough to make a good assessment

I will try to remember to update this review later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_277?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=277&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am very reluctant to buy earbuds for that reason and so far the apple standard earbuds have worked the best for me, especially while working out.

Having said that, the 65t work pretty well. Not perfect, but they hold well. I'm still on the fence for fit but I am pretty sure the problem is with my ears, not with these earbuds.

What I really like about these is the sound quality though. They did an amazing job over at Jabra with these! Pretty remarkable.

Other than that, there's a nice app and connectivity works well - but sometimes the left earbud won't work and I found that putting them back in the case and then back in my ears fixes that. weird and quite annoying but it doesn't happen that much (so far).

Once these are plugged into my ears, they are very comfortable and can be worn for a long time with no discomfort at all. I have not tried them yet while running or biking so wonder how they hold up. With biking, there's a risk that they fall of and will be very hard to find so I'll have to see about that.

the case maybe a little too thick for a pocket, I wish they had made it a little more compact but overall it's far from being a huge case (about 2/3 the size of a credit card in length and hight but obviously thicker...)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then at three months the volume on one earbud dropped to the point that it was impossible to use both earbuds at the same time -- either one earbud was too dim to hear, or the other one was too loud to withstand. Tried resetting, updating the firmware, reinstalling the app, changing the language on the earbuds, but nothing helped, so contacted customer support. Took them two weeks to get back to me, telling me to file a warranty claim. Then no further response for over another month in spite of me sending them several follow up emails. Out of the blue, about two months after I first contacted them, I get a shipping notification for a replacement earbud. That was one month ago now, and today I received a notice letting me know that the part is still backordered, and won't be available for shipping for at least another month (with the added kicker that they included a different customer's information on their email to me... any EU citizens might want to follow up under GDPR with Jabra...). In the off chance they actually ship it then, it'll be four months to resolve something that, from what the forums seem to suggest, is a relatively common technical problem with these earbuds. That's longer than these earbuds worked for.

The earbuds might be great, but Jabra's customer support is completely unresponsive -- likely understaffed, underfunded, and undervalued in the company. This was my first Jabra product and, thanks to the company's approach to (not providing) customer support, it's my last as well.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I will say that they took time to get used to how to get them in and out of my ear comfortably, but now that I have the hang of it, I love them. I commute 1 1/2 hours each way and have never ever had a battery issue. I have gotten feedback that people sometimes can't hear me on the phone, but I don't have long conversations, I use them mostly for music and podcasts. I would recommend these to friends and family. And I like how they look in, not too big or bulky and not like those stupid Apple ones with the white stick hanging out of your ear. I will also say that these do pause/stop working when I go through the subway turnstile. Must be a frequency thing, but it is super quick. . . I use these with my iPhone.

Customer service replaced them for free.","EDIT 11/2/2019: I got a better review from customer support. After the generic ""reinstall firmware"" advice, I told them that it didn't work, and they sent me a prepaid return label to send it back to them. Once they received the defective pair, they sent me a new pair that work well. I have done a little research, and it sounds like this issue with the left earbud quitting is actually quite common. I'm wondering if I'll have to repeat this process again at some point in the future. Either way, it looks like it's worth it to register the earbuds in order to get the two-year warranty. I'm giving them three stars for a known issue and the hassle, but they did make it right.

Well, I have had these for not quite a year, and the left earbud has completely quit on me. I sent an email to customer support and got a generic ""reinstall firmware"" email that did nothing. These earbuds were amazing, but I cannot recommend them if they cannot last more then a few months. I'm very disappointed, I spent a lot of money on reliable earbuds, and here I am with a defective pair.

This makes a $5 earbud mic feel like a studio mic.","I wish I had seen reviews on the Jabra 65T Elite's call quality. The person on the other end of the call will hear EVERY bit of background noise. Calls are extremely poor in any place but a dead silent room. Conversations/sound from even 20+ feet away would drive the other person on the call insane. This is completely unacceptable since cheap $5 headphones would produce 100x better calls. The associate even noted that these headphones would have better call quality (obviously knew nothing of this product).

I have HUGE BUYERS REMORSE and can only HOPE an update is released to fix this issue.

The noise cancellation is nearly zero unless you can somehow manage a perfect (and I mean perfect) fit in the ear. I cannot cut grass and use these as the engine noise overwhelms the earbuds. The range is pretty good, but easily interrupted by just about any obstruction so I'd rate range lower on the scale. My biggest complaint is the battery life versus the claimed battery life. They promote 5 hours of battery life and I can assure you you'll be lucky to get half of that if in continuous use situations. I use mine almost everyday and have never gotten more the 2.5 hours. From the other reviews 3 hours seems to be the norm.

One comment from people on the other end of my phone calls referenced significant background noise, particularly in open or crowded spaces (offices, airports, etc). Although my sound quality and clarity is strong, the challenge is for the receiver being able the hear my voice without having to raise it to a slight yell.  The background noise can be a major distraction. However, In quiet spaces, it’s perfect. I use it it in flight, in my office and while working out. The earbuds stay put!

I walk a lot outside while I’m on the phone and they’re hands down the best at cancelling out wind.

I use these all of the time for everything. The thing that I like most about these is that I can control the volume, and I can skip or go back to a track just using the left pod and having to take my phone out to do so like I did with other pods. It's a bummer when you're working out or running and you have to get your phone out to change the song because the song that came on sucks. With just the touch of a button, it's changed. My workouts last about 4hrs a day and the pods last that long or close to it depending on how loud your volume is. Of course I like mine loud so it's a give or take on the battery life. Sweat during my workout isn't even an issue. They play right through the sweat. The charging pod is amazing. Every true wireless ear pods that I've owned, the charging pod has broken and they don't have many charges in the before they need charging themselves. With the volume maxed out, the sound quality is still there. There's no distortion or anything. Very balanced sound and it puts you in the zone (at least for me it does). There's more than one inner ear cushion and if those doesn't work for you, simply buy some more that fit your ear because everyone's ear is different and what they provide may not fit your ear. I'd just hate for you to miss out on a great quality and sounding product because of something as simple as that. The microphone is pretty good to me. People can hear me with a little background noise but nothing major to complain about. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_265?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=265&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ability to isolate the music from the outside world is truly fantastic on these earbuds!  The ""past through"" feature works well on lower volumes, were I can carry on conversations just fine. However when the volume is 50% or more the effect isn't as noticeable and you would have trouble hearing conversation level noises, but you will hear things like a car honking or a cup falling for example. It gives yo the option to have the music turn off when ""pass through"" is turned on(double tap right ear bud), that way if someone wants to talk you don't have to turn down the music or take out the buds!
Bass is very good and can be made very loud and deep with the included apps EQ controls.
ONLY small negative is the volume buttons on the left side are a little hard to activate and you have to push hard enough to create some small discomfort,  I just leave them on high and use my phones buttons.
Overall I would buy them again in a heart beat.

Here is the good news:
These buds connected flawlessly the moment I removed them from the charging case.
took a few minutes to pick the correct size tips for my ears. it's imperative to get the correct size in order to have an excellent tight fit so the sound will be loud and the base will be very good.
if you have a smart watch like I do and like to listen to music while at the gym, be sure you pair the buds using the bluetooth on the watch first before setting up your Jabra using the Sound + App that you downloaded for your smart phone.
I love everything about these earbuds except the three Silicon eartips supplied by Jabra. I can only wear them for no more than 45 minutes at a time because they really hurt my ears. I called the Jabra technicians and asked "" don't your engineers wear these before releasing them to the public""??
I called Comply.com and asked if they have the foam tips for the Jabra Elite Active 65t? they told me they are working on it and for me to check back on their website in about a month.
Other than the discomfort of Jabra's Silicon eartips, I highly recommend these outstanding earbuds. Come on Jabra, fix the eartips and you will get five stars for sure.
UPDATE 07/11/2018: As one reviewer noted earlier, the eartips are fine, but the plastic body of the 65t, after sitting in my ears for about 45 minuets  started irritating the cartilage of both my ears. I don't know what can be done to stop that from occurring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Practical features make a profound difference to the user experience.","Let me start by stating that I’m sort of a Bluetooth headphone junkie. Given how subjective the audio quality experience is, over the years I’ve accumulated upwards of 15 or so BT headphones in all form factors due to trial and error attempts to find perfection. I’ve never felt motivated and compelled to write any reviews on any of them until now. This will probably give you some foreshadowing of how impressed I am with these buds. In terms of pure sound quality, the very best I’ve personally purchased and used are a pair of over the ear Sony MDRXB950BT cans with bass boost. Those monsters are simply amazing, but living in Phoenix I can only listen to them in the winter outside because over the ears are just too hot for me in the summer. Hence the quest to find anything close in an in-ear form factor. Now, I also proudly own a set of Powerbeast3 wireless headphones with the wire tether between the ear buds. That set is fantastic for sound quality and battery life. However, I simply can’t put up with the wire catching on my often sweaty neck in the gym or on the driving range. Enter the Jabari Elite 65t. After experimenting with a few cheapie sub-30 dollar “true wireless” headsets that left me gagging with disgust at the audio quality, I decided to up my game and go after the Jabra’s based on the 4 microphone design intended to dramatically improve transmitted audio quality on phone calls along with the reported excellent audio quality for playback. After a week of use, I’m here to claim that these buds are the gold standard for Android compatible in-ears with true wireless capability. If you want to know how I arrive at this conclusion, let me argue that Iron Hand by Dire Straits and Water Under the Bridge by Adele are but two of many, many examples of songs that simply destroy in-ear buds in general. I’m not claiming that the bass sections of these songs are as impressive in the Jabra’s as they are in the overl-the-ear Sony’s, but at the very least you can recongize it as the same song! Actually, the full frequency range of the Jabra’s is quite surprising and exceptional for the size. I’ve searched a long time for just this attribute, and then come the extras. Over multiple sets of BT buds, I’ve never found a set where folks I’ve called didn’t complain about not hearing me well on phone calls. With the Jabra’s so far, no one has even been able to tell the difference between standard cell phone calls and BT ear bud calls. They’re that good. Finally, the devil is in the details. The Jabra Elite 65t includes two features that completely ice the cake: Hear Through and Sidetone. The first lets you adjust how much ambient sounds you hear while playing music and the second lets you hear yourself while on a phone call. Both are slider adjustable through the companion phone app so that they can be fine tuned to your preference. This is a game changer in comfortable usability of the product. So, to summarize, exceptional sound quality for the form factor and at least reminiscent of top line over-the-ear cans for frequency range with outstanding usability as a phone call accessory. I haven’t even mentioned their support of either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant for voice commands, preferring to save that as a very pleasant Easter Egg for those willing to take the plunge. Cheers and happy jamming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Till then these are my only buds i'm using. i tend to change earbuds very frequent and own a bunch of branded headphones and earbuds but after owning these i never looked back. i use them during travel to work, during work, in gym and in home on weekends and making calls daily. these just integrated in to my lifestyle. good thing is even though i go to 9/10 on treadmill these just sticks to my ear. I recently tried and started using Alexa integration and came to know how much i missed that wonderful feature these long days. So far, I'm satisfied with the audio and call quality.

Drawback:
Most of my friends complain during call they hear the surrounding noise as clear as my voice. talking on a silent Environment is totally fine but if you are a person who talks during walk or at public stations the person on other end will just scream of that sounds. even if you are washing something in kitchen and talking on a call that sound will be transmitted to them in a high pace. i hope, jabra fixes this bug and target on human voice instead of just enhancing the sound the headphones receive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately, those hopes quickly died. I received my first pair of earbuds (that's right, first) and I immediately encountered issues with a loud hissing noise coming from the left earbud. I contacted Jabra support and they were quick to answer and attempted to fix the issue. I did a reinstall of the firmware but the problem still persisted.

I liked the way these earbuds fitted so I wanted to give them another shot. I placed an order for a replacement and received it the following day. I was greeted by a box that was clearly already open. The earbuds were definitely not brand new. So now, I had to get a replacement for my replacement. I received the new set of earbuds today (this is my third pair for those who are counting) and found it to have the exact same issue as pair number one. Even after updating the firmware.

Needless to say I'm very disappointed by the audio quality of this earbuds. Specially when the build quality and comfort levels were above the Samsung Gear IconX. I also learned that his is a persistent problem that's been happening on this particular set of earbuds at least since October of 2018.

The audio quality is only as good as true-wireless earphones less than 1/3 the price, connectivity is middling and requires multiple special apps, the physical buttons are stiff and from a low-end product 2 years ago, the charging case doesn't work well and is very hard to get open, and the fit of the earphones in the ears is only slightly above average.  However they do have a lot of features, the passive noise isolation is good, and they have extremely long battery life for true-wireless earphones.  I can't speak to the voice-pickup and voice-isolation of these, which seems to be an off-target feature for true-wireless headphones and their primary claim of quality.

Fit & Feel
----
The earphones themselves are a bit on the larger side for true-wireless earphones, but that's the trade-off for the battery life they provide.  They also don't stick out of your ears like you're the Communications Officer from the Original Star Trek like Bose and Senhauser products do.  They do fit into the arches of your ear very well and comfortably, and seat incredibly solidly.  As long as you have the correct ear-tip that actually fits just into your ear canal as instructed, they fit solidly into your ear with no worries about them coming loose or falling out even under vigorous exercise.
The ear-tips are a bit oddly formed though relative to the industry standard.  They have a more trapezoidal-shape to them rather than a partial-sphere-shape, and it's noticeable in how they feel within your ears.  I'm not sure if the ear-tip shape is supposed to provide better passive noise isolation, but it has no noticeable difference for me, and it actually causes extra pressure within the ears. I've found that the best measure of in-ear headphone quality is how comfortable your ears feel during extended wear, and these Jabras have come up a bit lacking.  I've tried some other true-wireless headphones and been able to wear them completely comfortably for 3+ hours sitting at a desk, at the gym, or on a run.  With the Jabras, my ears start feeling a bit pressed on the inside at around 1.5 hours and I feel like I need to take a break from them to let my ears relax.  I've heard others call this feeling an ""itchy"" feeling in the ear, and that also describes it well.  This is roughly what I get from middling-quality in-ear headphones made by any manufacturer and not what I'd expect from a product anywhere near this price point.
These earphones also emit a slightly concerning heat from the inner side of them when in use.  It almost feels like the battery inside each earphone gets pretty warm during use, enough that it's noticeable around the area of the earphone body where the battery contacts are located.  I thought I was crazy at first, but I took them out to check, and the inner side of them was definitely noticeably above skin-surface temperature.  It's not hot enough that it's uncomfortable, just noticeable and worth mentioning.  It very well might be related to the ""in-ear detection"" feature that can be used to auto-pause since I don't see any visible sensors on the inside of the earphones other than the over-sized battery contacts that might be doubling as a resistive sensor.

Controls
----
The control scheme on these earphones is pretty much bland-standard for any Bluetooth device, you have an up and down button on one earphone, and a multi-function button on the other.  The up and down button primarily control volume, but on a long press do next and previous.  The multi-function button is largely a play-pause toggle, or when a call comes in it's a tap to accept and double-tap to reject button.  If you're not on a call, you can also double-tap to toggle the HearThru mode, and long press to trigger the voice assistant.  With an up and down button on an earphone that may be oriented at a different angle for every person, they've smartly added little tactile tick marks to indicate where the center of the up and down areas are.  However instead of the buttons truly being oriented in something approaching an up and down, they're oriented along an upper-back to lower-forward diagonal that will never vary enough from individual to individual to actually approximate up and down or forward and back.  Furthermore, standard control organization generally associates the same functionality with up and forward, and with down and back.  This mixes that up so it always takes a second to think about whether you're pushing an ""up"" button or a ""back"" button when you press the upper-back button, buttons that would normally have exactly oppposite effects.
Unfortunately they seem to have tried to shy away from the capacitive/resistive touch buttons completely with this product, instead using stiff physical buttons.  While this makes it less likely you'll accidentally press a button, it works very poorly for true-wireless headphones.  Unlike most headphones, true-wireless headphones have no structure to resist you pushing the earphone deeply into your ear when you have to push a physical button.  With stiff buttons, this problem is even worse.  These earphones are clearly made by someone who doesn't understand that at all, because pushing any of the buttons at all requires enough force to be distinctly uncomfortable both in your ear canal and the area outside your ear.  Double tapping actually becomes nearly impossible because each press moves the earpiece so significantly out of position and into the flesh of your head, that your finger motion is more than that necessary for a key on a standard computer keyboard.  Releasing the button enough to then press it again while trying to blindly maintain your finger's orientation relative to the earphone is extremely difficult as a result, which is the very reason all modern manufacturers use touch-sensitive buttons that require minimal finger motion to tap and double-tap.

Battery Life & Connectivity
----
The battery life on these true-wireless headphones is hugely beefy compared to all other products in the market.  Unfortunately that's not as big a benefit as most people would think, and it seems to largely be a necessity for support of some of the ""unique"" features they provide.  Most true-wireless headphones have a continuous battery life of about 2-4 hours before they need to be recharged, depending on the product, the volume they're used at, the distance from the phone, and other various specialty features they may have.  Listening to music sitting at a desk with my phone next to me and HearThru mode disabled, I've had these last 6 hours and still report 25% battery life remaining.  However the HearThru mode that plays ambient noise thru the earphones to allow situational awareness seems to have a huge impact on battery life, doing the same with HearThru enabled put me down to 25% battery life in just 3 hours.  However, considering this puts them on the upper end of the industry standard battery life even when a battery hogging feature is on, that's quite impressive.  I haven't test what the impact to battery life is if the step counting mode is also turned on, or if you're mostly making phone calls instead of listening to music/podcasts.  I also haven't tested the impact on battery when you're about 6 feet away from your phone on average and occasionally walk 20 feet away from it to grab something (like when I go to the gym).  However the existing tests do seem to indicate a very respectable battery life could be expected.
Connectivity quality of these earphones is unfortunately a bit shoddy, though not as bad as budget true-wireless devices from years past.  The earphones do consistently and unerringly connect to each other, which is much better than some products, but seem to have issues with the connection to the phone.  This might be an effect of how they've been forced to setup their connection with the phone to support some of their ""unique"" features, but it's generally unacceptable.  Like almost all true-wireless earphones, one of the earphones is a master device and one's a slave, with the slave earphone connecting only to the master earphone while the master earphone connects to the slave and whatever other devices your ""headphones"" are connected to.  Like most Bluetooth headphones in general, this requires putting the ""headphones"" (the master earphone) into a pairing mode, then searching for it as a new device on your phone.  Also like most nice Bluetooth ""headphones"" that support being paired with multiple devices simultaneously, once paired the ""headphones"" will maintain a prioritized list of devices with preference given to the most recently paired.  Given the connection issues between the master earphone and the phone however, this process can be rather onerous.  Almost 50% of the time I've used these earphones I've had to forget the device on my phone and repair it to access the ""advanced"" features it provides.  While I've never had any issues that required re-pairing when just using them like regular headphones, any voice assistant functionality, HearThru toggle, or EQ setting changes (I've never tried the step counting), have required re-pairing the devices so the Jabra apps recognize it properly and provide these functions.  This appears to occur because Jabra actually requires two apps be installed to use the extra features of their earphones, one app to modify the settings and one app to intercept what your earphones send to your phone so it can determine if that should modify your settings, toggle the customizable voice assistant, etc.

Sound & Audio Quality
----
For such a high-cost device, the playback quality on these earphones is suprisingly mediocre, even among true-wireless headphones.  The customizeable EQ settings allow you to add a little more bass or treble, or whatever you feel might be lacking in default output of most headphones, but even cranked to the extremes of the EQ range, none of the differences seem hugely different from the default flat EQ.  In comparison to low-end Bose wireless headphones (not true-wireless Bose) that cost less than these, these Jabra earphones sound completely standard rather than anything approaching high-end or premium like they claim.  They do do a decent job of passive noise isolation, but once again it's only about average.  A number of other average in-ear headphones, wired, wireless, and true-wireless, all have unnoticeably different passive noise isolation.  This includes devices that are less than 1/6th the cost of these Jabra earphones.
It seems one of Jabra's major claims with these is that they provide premium levels of voice isolation with these earphones for when you're talking in a call.  I'm not sure why they've decided to focus on this, since true-wireless earphones aren't really intended for this purpose and are notoriously bad at it during the best of times.  I personally have no use for this, I'll switch to my Plantronics wireless headset that gives me 10x the quality for 1/2 the price if I need voice isolation from the mic.  In fact, them implementing the isolation via 2 mics in each of the earphones working together seems like an odd choice, since most people jumping on a call where they'd need the voice isolation from the mic probably don't want to fiddle with independently putting two separate devcies in their ears and will likely want to put in only the single master device so you can better hear yourself, which won't give you as good of voice isolation.  Furthermore, the focus on voice isolation from the mic seems to have strongly negatively impacted the HearThru feature that seems much more useful to me.

""Unique"" Features
----
Alexa as a voice assistant.  Unless you specifically want Alexa as your voice assistant, this actually makes the product worse.  The Bluetooth standard has a common way to trigger the native voice assistant so almost any Bluetooth 5.0 device can do it without an app being required on your phone.  Jabra is trying to make it configurable to select between triggering your native voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant) and Alexa.  This means they have to use and intercept a non-standard Bluetooth command from the earphones that gets interpreted by the settings app to trigger the right one.  Given the extreme connectivity issues with this intercepting application, it means that instead of simply losing the ability to use some of the highly specialized features they provide, you're also losing the ability to trigger the native voice assistant when the connectivity fails.  If they weren't supporting Alexa as an optional voice assistant, they could use the standard Bluetooth 5.0 command that would always trigger the native voice assistant.

HearThru.  A great idea, allowing situational awareness by replaying the ambient noises without delay so you can effectively cancel the passive noise isolation.  This isn't a unique feature to Jabra, other products like the Samsung Gear X have it also.  Unfortunately Jabra's focus on voice isolation from the mics seems to have severely degraded this much more useful feature.  The audio that comes thru when HearThru mode is enabled is tinny, slightly staticy, and quiet.  It's bad enough that the feature is barely useful, only serving to let you hear particularly loud noises that would normally be reduced to minor background noises by the passive noise isolation of the ear-tips. Most importantly, this doesn't work well enough to enable it and actually have a conversation with someone without feeling like you can't hear yourself, meaning it doesn't implement Jabra's ""Hear yourself in calls"" feature for real-world interactions.

Hear yourself in calls.  If you're actually trying to use both earphones while in a call, you are going to have problems with the passive noise isolation making your voice sound weird to yourself.  It makes a lot of sense to replay your voice in your own ears in this case.  If you're also going to have heavy voice isolation from the mic, it also makes a lot of sense to supply that audio instead of all ambient audio while you're in the call.  This seems like a minimum necessary feature if someone is actually going to use these earphones for making calls.

Auto-pause on removal.  An interesting feature that doesn't rely on connectivity with the app.  Since the earphones only have a button capable of pausing on the right ear, this makes a lot of sense for the left ear.  Since the button on the right ear is stiff and hard to press, it also makes some sense for the right ear.  This feature could be made completely unnecessary if the buttons were less stiff and a way to pause were provided from both earphones like most products have.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_303?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=303&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got 3 more days left out of my 30 days to test my patients or go for a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_341?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=341&reviewerType=all_reviews"

SOUND: The Jabra Elite 65t have average sound quality at best. I prefer slightly more bass in my headphones and when I turned them on I found that these had almost no bass, even after I adjusted the EQ for extra bass that did not help. The sound quality was tinny and there was never a moment when I wanted to keep listening.
CONNECTION: One thing that these do well is connection. With bluetooth 5.0 there is no input lag when watching videos which was amazing and made watching videos awesome, this is to be expected from bluetooth 5.0. There was no serious skipping when listening to music with my phone in my pocket. This is something that was a serious problem with my Jaybird X3 earbuds.
BATTERY: The battery on these is good, with about 4 hours of play with my personal use and with the case holding another 10 hours of battery and every time you put them in the case it begins charging them. So, realistically the battery life is plenty for any normal use.
COMFORT: I have small ears so this could easily be a personal issue, but these earbuds are extremely uncomfortable. The earbud are physically very big and therefore would push against my ear while wearing them. After a normal day of wearing them my ears were sore which made wearing them even more unbearable. The earbuds are hard plastic and if you have small ears like me then these are extremely uncomfortable and this reason is ultimately the reason I returned them. However, at no point did these earbuds fall out of my ears or even feel loose. Which was very comforting knowing that $160 earbuds won't fall out and break.
CONCLUSION: These are decent true wireless earbuds, their connection are unrivaled and battery life are good. However, the sound quality is not good and noticeably worse than my wired earbuds and even my Jaybird X3. And like I said before these are extremely uncomfortable earbuds. I did end up returning these and going back to my wired earbuds. I could not get over the faults of these and for the price those faults should not be there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The overall experience is almost perfect. They've worked great in all situations including running, hiking, gym, biking and walking near traffic.

4.5/5 - well worth the retail price

PROS:
- excellent sound quality for truly wireless (supports AAC)
- very good build quality with soft touch coating
- IP56 rating which pretty much makes them dust resistant and sweat proof
- Bluetooth 5.0 - impressive range (50+ feet), no stuttering
- no audio lag with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.
- sound isolation works great if one of the included ear gels creates a good seal
- secure fit: won't fall out even while running
- hear through option for letting in specified amount of ambuent noise +great for running outside or walking near traffic)
- Jabra app with EQ, hear through options, preferences for different settings (active, focus, commute), user manual and find my Jabra
- intuitive buttons for power, assistant, hear through, volume and next song
- sounds great on phone calls
- battery life: 5 hrs on 1 charge with 2 extra charges in the charging case
- quick charge: 15 mins charging will provide 1.5 hrs battery life
- overall design: lightweight, look very minimal, don't stick way out like Bose Soundsport
- 2 year warranty covering damage from dust + sweat

CONS:
- no magnets to keep earbuds locked in case
- no included comply foam tips
- micro USB instead of USB type C
- bass is adequate and can be boosted with app but definitely not for bass heads","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
Good sound quality
Hearthrough feature sounded a bit robotic but worked better than the Galaxy buds I currently own.
Best wireless headphone microphone I've ever used.

Cons:
Hurt ears and doesn't fit all ear types. Large headphone.
Fell out all the time, this goes back to the fit as they weren't very secure in my ears as claimed.
If you want to only use on headphone at a time, you can only use the right earbud. This seems nitpicky but working in an office setting the hearthrough can only help so much. Being able to use either headphone at a time is a feature that doesn't seem like a big deal but when you can only wear it in your right ear it will start to hurt.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It should be noted I don't use the included ear foams.  I use ComplyFoams.  This is not because of a failure of the headphones. I have large ear canals and find only the expanding complyfoams work right for me.

2. The original firmware a year ago was significantly quieter than the headphones as they exist on today's firmware.  Jabra heard the complaints and fixed many different issues that users had pointed out.

3. As is expected with a Jabra product, people have all commented on how crystal clear conversations are in a quiet environment.  That said, a couple of people have also stated the microphone is so good that I have to mute during conference calls.

Downsides:
1. I wish I could use the slave alone.
2. They are not exactly light, which leads to ear pain if I use them more than a couple hours at a time.  This again may be me and my ear sensitivity.
3. Minor complaint , the default voice in the headpiece has a pretty thick accent.

I read a lot of the other reviews and decided to go and purchase them anyways.

The Good:
*Look & Feel - Pairing the device is fairly easy and didn't cause any issues. The overall look and feel are pretty great as well! Compared to the Bose Wireless earbuds, these are smaller and feel lighter. I've taken these on runs, workouts, and commutes. There had been no issues of them falling out and the fit is quite snug.

*HearThrough Function - The double press to HearThrough function is definitely awesome when you don't want to take out the earbuds to listen to announcements or someone talk.

*Battery Life - I've gone a few days with a few hours of use each day and haven't had to charge the case that often. Compared to other earbuds I've owned, this has exceptional battery life.

*Mic Quality - Although I don't really use the Mic that often, I've tested it and the sound itself isn't terrible. The voice recognition can pick up your voice in relatively loud places.

The Bad:
*Static Noise - So like a lot of people, I've been hearing a white sound that's predominantly in the left earbud. The minor fix for android users goes into developer options and disable absolute volume. Then you would turn your earbud volume down 4-5 clicks, and use your phone to adjust the volume after. That being said, the sound quality won't be able to go as high as I'd like them without hearing the hissing white sound.

*Connectivity - Not sure why or how, but the Bluetooth connection sometimes breaks randomly. There would be noticeable stutters at random times, and sometimes the left side of the earbud won't connect at all.

*Jabra Sound+ App - The App is absolute garbage, just read the reviews on the app store. The different ""preferences"" don't change anything, the locate my earbuds function isn't that great, and it sits idle on your phone and takes up battery life.

Overall, I would definitely not recommend these. I've bought cheaper less known brands from Amazon for around ~$50 and they function about the same. For what you're paying for the Jabra earbuds, you're getting a huge markup for what essentially is cheap earbuds with HearThrough function. If these were maybe ~$60-$70, then I'd recommend buying them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_399?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=399&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The medium (default) buds weren’t isolating the sound for me, so everything sounded thin and cheap.. I also utilized the EQ from the accompanying Jabra mobile app - Then: big improvement, shocking amount of low frequency without muddying the overall, and fairly clear separate highs and mids. It’s not a $500 set of over-ear cans, but damn, does this pack some quality into popcorn-light ear buds.

Things I kinda don’t like:
1) Faint static and pops when the device is transitioning between modes or searching for signal.
2) Delicate maneuvering in and out of the case/ears - these are soooo light and rounded, I wish the case has a magnetic element to coax them into place. But, if you hold it/them, you’ll wonder if magnets would even help.. it’s like the overall design and grip-ability could have just been slightly better. One of these days, I’m GOING to drop one, and I hope it’s not on the move in a crowded place. My hands are average/slender and pretty dexterous, so If you have enormous sausage fingers, you may want to handle these in a store before buying.
3) Very infrequent drops in signal to one side, or finicky Bluetooth auto-connection... Almost not worth complaining about 99% of the time, but it does sometimes happen. Seems industry-wide tho.
4. The need to use the app for their (very useful but highly compressed) HearThrough feature. I -could- program the Up or Down clicks on the buds themselves to toggle it, but then I’d have to give up Volume, or give up FF/Rev... which would be silly.. so the moral to this story is: Jabra, please enable a Triple click function. You’ve maxed out your single and double click navigations, so there’s only one thing left to do.....

Things I like:
1) Bass. Bass bass bass BASS. Can’t get over it. Feels like the battery should drain in 20m, but they go for hours and -then- get a couple charges from the case. Unbelievable. Make SURE you’re using the right sized rubber buds.
2) The OPTION to disable the ‘Device Narrator’. Seriously can’t stand a voice yapping to me from any device or speaker multiple times per hour, so muting it/her on Jabra was a big plus for me.
3) The 3-band EQ within the app - awesome. I wish there were more preset options like there are for the apple iTunes/Music app. And if they could get tagged/saved for specific songs/albums/artists, that would be great.
4) Now I don’t look like an Apple clone. I like Apple and use their products, but it’s nice not having those white pokeys sticking out my ears like the other 6-12 people directly surrounding me..
5. Finally, the comfort and overall quality. These were a great purchase, even if I hadn’t gotten them 33% off on Black Friday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_311?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=311&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If they weren't, then that makes them a 1 star set of earbuds.
The fit - They fit my ears very well. So well that it was a bit of a struggle to remove them. Nothing painful...
Paring to my phone - Straight up simple and automatically connected every time when powered on.
Sound - Barely audible at full volume. Ran through all of the trouble shooting and nothing helped. A lot of phones now days have a safety feature that limits volume levels to prevent hearing damage. I even overrode that and it did not improve. So the earbuds had to go back to Amazon.
One thing to note is that I purchased these from the Amazon renewed section, which guarantees the item to work like new. Well, someone failed to test these before offering them back up for sale. I will say that for used earbuds, they were spotless clean upon opening. So props for that attention to detail.
I also got them at a greatly reduced price, the price for brand new ones are a bit steep, which is why I opted not to retry another pair to see if these were just defective.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_304?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=304&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Audio is good, there is almost no delay when watching videos. Bass could be deeper, but is good enough.  I love the pass through capability, and the white noise options.
They worked great in the office, nothing better then to help block out all the noise around so I can concentrate better.
Until the audio in the left earbud stopped working right. Audio was working but the volume was so low I could hardly tell.

After going back and forth with Jabra for about 2 weeks, they authorized a replacement set under warranty.
It's now been a month since then, and the replacement order is still ""being processed"".

I got as far with Jabra to the point where they told me I would receive an email from their shipping partner on instructions to return my device and receive the new one.

Sound quality is about as good as any apple headphone, but there is a slight buzz/ring when you have the sound canceling thing on that’s quite annoying. You have to turn up the volume to not hear it.

I was skeptical to pony up for these, but I have to say that I am thoroughly pleased. I mainly got these because I wanted headphones that were obnoxious loud for the gym and no other wireless headphones that I've owned did the trick.  Well these do! They're very loud and the noise cancelling is great. Even without playing sound, your hearing is noticeably suppressed with these in your ear. Ive also found that these are great at staying connected, without one ear going on and off as other wireless ear buds do. The daul connection is great too, I can be playing a song on my computer, then walk away and keep playing it on my phone without having to switch pairing.

I also like that when you remove one earbud out of your ear, it pauses whatever music you are playing which is great when working out, in the yard, etc versus having to fiddle with pausing my music app. The Jabra Elite 65t tightly seal in your ear which is better for me because I can actually play my music at a lesser volume because it is not competing with other noise.

And calls are clear according to people who I have spoke with. The charging case is cool. They look cool.
Cons: they don't stay in my ear. The first day I got them they fell out. I eventually got used to it and I can feel when they are coming out and I push them back in. The music skips when I begin biking. It usually only last for a minute or so but sometimes it randomly skips. I attribute this to the movement. Final strike was when the left ear bud started going out. I only had them for three weeks.

I'm a woman, with average size ears, (I checked online!) and these simply don't fit and aren't comfortable. It's not about the part of the headphone that goes into your ear canal, which does come with different sized attachments, but the fact that theses are supposed to fit comfortably in the 'cup' of your ear - they don't. They fall out constantly - when I can wedge them in hard enough I get a headache and I'm concerned about damaging my ears.

I love these things!  They did a great job of blocking out the regular airplane noise and I watched a movie on my iPad with no wires.  These are true 'wireless', not like other bluetooth headphones that still have wires hanging around the back of your neck...I hate those because every time you move, you can hear them rubbing on your clothes.

It should go without saying that the best performance requires a good fit.  There are three sets of tips included and you should try them all before deciding which to use.  If the tips are too big, they are not comfortable...too small, and they fall out.

My flight was a total of 6 hours long, with a plane change in Chicago.  The batteries lasted just fine for the first half and I stuck them in the case to boost the charge while I ran to the next plane.  I had no trouble at all using them for the entire flight.  Speaking of the case, this is a really nice case.  It is small and hard and very lightweight, so it protects and charges them without weighing down your bag.

I have also used them a few times while walking around and again, the true wire-free comfort is wonderful.  They're paired with my iPhone for that purpose.  The sound is excellent for music or audiobooks.  I've tried both and I'm quite happy with them.

I tested their ability to block out noise while at a sound check for a major concert, literally standing in front of a speaker stack in section A, row 14 to be sure I wasn’t off to the side and was getting the full blast of the speaker system and I could hear every word and instrument of my music playing through the buds!!

The Bluetooth connection with my MacBook is okay; the signal cuts out sometimes. The Bluetooth connection with my Windows laptop is better; almost never cuts out. However on either computer, the music doesn’t consistently automatically pause when the ear buds are removed. It seems to pause some of the time when I’m using an app, but not when I’m using a web browser (YouTube, Pandora, etc).

Works as described with an iPhone. No complaints.

Sound quality is great at low (office) volumes. Pass through feature is neat but weird at first. Takes getting used to so I’m glad I can turn it on and off.

The Jabra Sound+ app is basic but gets the job done.

I haven’t used any competing products, but since they all use Bluetooth to compress the signal, I doubt I’d notice much of a ‘sound quality’ difference. Sure, one product might produce more bass than another product. But in terms of actual sound quality, I doubt there would be enough of a difference in ear buds of this price range for me to care.

I definitely recommend these and would definitely buy these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is weird that connected to my Surface tablet using a phone and listening to music I can’t stay in stereo - the mic only works with handsfree setting and doesn’t automatically switch back and forth.  Still, I can take calls on computer and iPhone without having to re-pair devices.

Comfortability is good AT FIRST. These really fit in my ear very well. But after an hour or so. They begin the hurt your ear. If you are looking to get these for long use. Just know that you will feel some discomfort.

Mic is good and clear when you talk to someone on the phone

The ""seal"" feature creates an annoying echo when you talk and these are not comfortable for more than an hour.

I spent hours researching reviews on reputable sites such as ""The Wirecutter"" and ""TechRadar""
I have an Android phone, so didn't think AirPods would work for me.  I have Bose Soundsport wired headphones and find them very comfortable, but have been having issues using them on calls recently.

The Jabra Elite 65t were the winners by TechRadar, the WireCutter, and Tom's Guide, which is why I chose them.  All these sites touted the feature that these formed a tight seal for noise cancelling, and features such as hear through.

My main use case for the earbuds is talking on the phone whille doing chores in my apartment, and listening to audiobooks and podcasts when I walk home from work.  Talking on the phone with these headphones is a nightmare.  The ""seal"" around the ears makes my own voice feel like a terrible echo when talking on the phone.  The seal also bothers me when I listen to audio books in.  I find these so uncomfortable I cannot even speak to the battery life since these are so uncomfortable I can't wear them for more than an hour.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Build quality is pretty good, buttons are tactile and easy to push (though it does suck to push the earbuds in further when pushing those buttons). Microphone is exceptional for phone calls.

I’ve had them for about 3 days now and I’ve worn them for about a total of 24 hours or so. While at work I had them on for about 4 hours and my ears are hurting. I really love the sound quality when listening to music and even the call quality is really good. There to me beat out the other 2 on features but i really don’t like the comfort problem. I bought these to use at work. I have a pair of Bose quite Comfort 35 that I love but can’t use those at work. I was really excited to try the Jabra elite 65t and unfortunately I’m very disappointed with the comfort problem so much so that I’m thinking of returning them.
UPDATE: I ended up keeping the Jabra and took some time to get used to the feel and fit in my ear and I'm so glad I did. After using them for about a year now I really love them. All of the features are worth the money. I use them for listening to music and talking on the telephone and I's say these earphone are the best out there and worth every penny.

When connecting to the phone during a call, it connects almost instantly unlike other Bluetooth units I've had in the past.

My only concern is the size of the earpiece makes misplacing them easier. That's not a flaw or concern. Just a warning for those who have trouble keeping up with things. I'm thinking of having one for the car and 1 for home.

Bought them for my wife for working out, doing yard work, and listening to music at work.

The good: Sound is great.  They automatically pause music when you take one out.  Call quality is also very good.

The bad: They don't stay in the ear very well.  If you do happen to get them in firmly, the speaker hole gets blocked or compressed where you can't hear anything and have to readjust it. If you open your mouth all the way they come out of your ear, which makes eating with them worthless.  I even tried them out for cutting grass and they constantly would move just enough to cut out sound.  We tried the 3 different size cushions and it just never worked for us.

Sadly I didn't try them out first, and now it's past the return date.  Definitely would not recommend them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far they are great; I haven't run with them yet, but walking around they sound fantastic, and feel secure in my ears.  I like that the phone app has eq adjustment.  It's a major listening enhancement.

Edit: I've now run with them, and they stay secure.  I've always had problems with Apple earbuds staying secure during run; these work much better.

Ultimately I decided on the Jabras since they consistently get picked as top performers with the best well-rounded package of features. I also bought them on a Christmas sale for $140 - I definitely would not pay more than that after testing them out for a month. I'm a somewhat cheap person and I think there are reasonable alternatives for less (Anker Soundcore Liberty Air, Mobvoi Ticpods Free) or better alternatives if money is no concern (RHA Trueconnect) - but keep in mind that I never tried any of those devices so that's just based on my obsessive researching.
Pros:
- excellent sound quality, enjoyable experience listening to podcasts, music, or video. I've noticed very little lag in watching video
- excellent, easy pairing and bluetooth connection. The connection does not stretch far so I've had some dropped signal when I move more than 2 rooms away in my house, and occasionally when outside the signal will blink out for a second, I can't tell why, but it comes right back (probably happens once for every 2-3 hours of listening time).
- I really ended up loving the controls, especially the volume control. I found if I used one finger to stabilize the device, that pushing the buttons did not hurt my ear. Initially, I wasn't sure how much I would use the controls but after a month, I would definitely only consider devices with volume controls in the future. It is awesome to be able to skip tracks, change volume, pause/play easily while running without taking out my phone.
- good for phone calls. Even walking by heavy traffic, the other person could still hear me well (but they do get a lot of background noise), and often with better voice quality than I get on my iphone

Cons:
- the biggest con for me is the fit. While they are incredibly stable and I have no concerns about them falling out while running or doing HIIT work outs, they start to hurt my ear canal, concha, and antitragus (to be specific) within an hour of wearing them. I often have to readjust them to take pressure off certain parts of my ears. This is obviously an individual issue since a lot of people find the fit great.
- poor noise isolation. I was very disappointed by this feature, my $20 wired earbuds offer better passive noise isolation than these do. I've tried all 3 tip sizes with no improvement. The largest size tips create a weird suction feeling that is uncomfortable and noisy itself, while the medium size tips let in too much ambient noise. I'm considering Comply foam tips but those seem to get a mixed bag of reviews. If you don't mind ambient noise or listen to your music at full volume, this may not bother you very much.
- the case does seem a little cheap, I agree with reviews that question how long the plastic latch will last. Seems like Jabra should have installed the magnetic closure that most other high end wireless buds use.

Overall, the quality of these earbuds is excellent and I never have issues with their function. My two biggest cons were not things I could have predicted until I tried the earbuds on myself. I'm not sure I would purchase these again, but for now I'm keeping them because I still think they beat the competition when you consider all the features they provide, I just wish I knew how to predict which earbud would fit my ears best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had to return it and get Elite Active 65t instead which I found to be super secure.  So if you're planning on listening while being active, spend the extra $$$ and get the Elite Active 65t.

=== update 6/1/2018 ===

Sure enough, as mentioned by other reviewers, Elite Active 65t does NOT fall out even during vigorous physical activity.  It also has a ""fast charge"" feature where a quick 15 min charge will give another 1.5 hours of use.  Given that, spending extra $20 for Active is pretty much a no-brainer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_391?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=391&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love how you can stop the music by removing one earbud and to start playing again, you simply reinsert it. Now for the bad and the reason I took off a star are the different size tips and how they are all quite uncomfortable. My ear starts hurting after about 30 minutes or so and I think it has to do with the shape. If I push them in, my ears really hurt so I have to insert them loosely.

It’s insane that you can’t find a decent pair of wireless earbuds that are meant for smaller ears. I’m an active woman and I care about sound quality just as much as the next guy. But for some reason, if I want wireless earbuds, the only companies willing to accommodate small ears are on the lower end of the quality spectrum. Even with the smallest rubber fitting, I couldn’t fit these into my ears. They are comically large. This review won’t matter to most guys, but maybe I can save most women’s time. A couple of off-brands that will fit your ears - but lack decent sound quality -  are EnodMini Ring and Enacfire.

Nice easy to read owners manual and instructions in app.  Lots of control with earbud touch controls, easy to use and actually work well just hard to remember all the options they provide.  Didn't test call audio but these have very good reviews.  Zero connections so far and I've tried lots of ways to see if they fail.  Even tested extremely close to wi-fi router to see if I could reproduce the left bud hissing issue.  None whatsoever.  Decent battery life w/ 2 recharges in case.  Even though slightly larger than Galaxy Buds about same comfort level.  About 1 hour for me.  Had more consistent ear seals and bottom end than Galaxy Buds but thought Galaxy Buds sounded slightly better but had to reseal the buds all the time.  Biggest downside on these is not much at all but would include no wireless charging and antiquated USB micro charge connector.  Ironically reviews said it was likely to have left bud hiss issues and connectivity issues but have had none.  It was actually the Galaxy Buds I returned because of connectivity issues.

A friend recommended these and i'm very picky about my earphones especially with sound and most importanly comfort and fit since i work, i hate headphones/earphones that pop out. We i decided to finally get them because my Bose sound sport, although great headphones i eventually got tired of the cord.
  These 65t right off the package felt high quality, pairing took 10 seconds, the default earbuds fit perfectly, and the app you can download to make changes is very easy to use.
Sound: Many have said that sounds is pretty decent, coming from bose where i had raise the volume almost all the way up to get good sound, these have much better volume. Noice cancellation works really well and if youre not a fan of it you can always turn it off. Default sounds is actually great, if your a bass freak then youll deff want to adjust the sounds with the equalizer youll notice a small difference but still good. im very happy with Sound
 Fit: as i mentioned earlier these fit amazingly well right out the box so unless you have huge earholes or tiny they have spare earbuds to change to. I run and work out, i havent even tested them out at the gym yet but i can already tell you these will not fall out. i'm extremely happy on that aspect. Comfort will take some getting used to as any other new heaphones so give it some time for your ear to adjust to them.
App: extremely easy to use, not too many options to figure out but the ones on there area very useful. i like hearing ambient sounds when i sleep so i was excited when i see they have an option, big plus for me, shows battery life. Win!
Connection: these paired very fast and easy. i did loose sound to my left ear but i took it off and back on real quick and fixed it. i'm not bothered by it, hopefully it wont happen again. quick fix i'm not bothered by it.
Overall: Yea, maybe my review is not as great as other users but if the other 5 star rating and this one doesn't convince you then youre overthinkin it!! i strongly recommend you purchase these, worth the $190. especially if your into fitness and what not, and even if your not then these wont fail you. Get them!!! Again, i will update if if i have any problems, but i'm confident these will last me a good long while(knock on wood) :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_274?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=274&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve never used any earbuds with silicone tips that sounded good; very thin and tinny. I bough some foam ear pieces, which helped some, but they will not seat in my ear well enough to create decent sound isolation. The microphones for calls were also weak.

The app for controlling the EQ is laughably I adequate...6 pesets and no ability to save customizations (which with only 4 band eq, you’re already severely limited).

I don't think it is related to a connection issue as it doesn't get better if I move my phone and/or re-position the earbuds. It sounds more like a blown driver or clipping, but the fact that I typically play them at low-ish volumes and that the issue is intermittent makes me think that they're not actually damaged.

-the dual device pairing works well (phone + laptop for me)
-hear through mode is really handy (although it doesn't work when primary pairing switches to laptop call)
-sound quality and battery life are very good
-easy and comfortable to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use these all the time during my workouts with no issues.

At first when I got these I was not a huge fan of the sound. As updates came out everything I was struggling with was fixed. There was balance problems, fixed. Strange buzzing or slight disconnects, fixed. I am so glad that Jabra really cares.

The passthrough has to be my favorite feature as it allows me to listen yet be aware of my surroundings. This of course degrades the audio quality however can easily be toggled with a double click of the right bud.

The controls on the buds work great, but could be improved if they were touch pads. Having to mash headphones into your ear to complete actions is never fun. Thankfully these only require a light press compared to other brands I have tried.

I wish there was a better way to keep them in your ears. The large tips hurt, yet medium eventually work their way out of my ears. Be aware of this as there are no wings to help keep them in.

tldr;
Balanced audio quality
Sweet design
Great for exercise
Okay controls
Decent comfort
Good sound cancellation
Amazing passthrough audio
Nice app with EQ
Awesome battery life

"1573054171-8825","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews","Extremely Impressive Sound, Especially EQ'd. Instructions Are Lacking","First of all, the aesthetics of the Jabra packaging is exceptional, and similar in style, to how Apple packages their products (clean, minimalist, well integrated and very classy), which may only be important if you are giving them as a gift.

As far as a user manual goes, there are very minimalist line drawings of the pair, with abbreviated instructions on how to turn them on and how to use them (see photos). To kick start them, right out of the box, I placed them in my ears and simultaneously held down the left button on the left earpiece and the only center disc button on the right earpiece for 3 seconds, which turned them on automatically and activated voice prompts in the earbuds on how to pair them. Mine paired very quickly without doing a ""scan"" for devices on my Samsung. They popped up almost immediately in my ""available devices"".  And the strength and stability of the signal was very solid.

I found these to be very comfortable and snug in the ear and very stable in gym workouts. Their ""in ear fit"" is far better than competitive earbuds, which have different shapes and sizes of wing extensions designed to hold them in the ear. I have never liked those because they always seem to unseat themselves, especially when sweating. But not so with this new Jabra. High marks for fit, which also includes 3 alternate sizes of silicone attachments to fit different sizes of ear canals. I used the pair which came mounted on the earbuds.

There are also 4 directional microphones in each ear piece, which I found to produce a very natural sound when making phone calls. I asked those whom I called if they noticed anything different about the sound that they were hearing at the other end and they said, ""No, your call sounds normal. Why?""  I explained that I was on earbud mics. So that feature passes the test. The multiple microphones are a part of Jabra's passive noise cancelling over-ride features. Primary noise cancelling occurs passively by virtue of the tight fit of the silicone attachments on the earpieces. But when you want to admit outside sounds for safety or personal reasons you can alter what these do, through a feature that Jabra calls ""Hear Through"" (which exists only in Jabra's Sound+ app download. For instance, to hear traffic outdoors on a bike or walking, or to be able to hear ambient room noise or voices, such as a P.A. announcements.

If you download the Jabra Sound+ app, you can manipulate your earbuds, on screen, with your smartphone. Some of the feature options in Sound+ are an equalizer, or controlling the way your voice sounds on phone calls, along with more advanced features, such as the aforementioned ""Hear Through"", which uses an onscreen slider to control how much of the outside sound is channeled through the headset, while listening to music. This phone app also controls default settings for phone use, and also to connect to Siri, Alexa, or Google. And the ""Hear Through"" feature is activated by a double press of the right earbud. Although music sounds much better without this feature activated, so I will use it rarely. One other feature in the Sound+ app, is the ability to engage or disengage auto pause when removing the earbuds and reinserting them, which is kind of a nice feature, in which you don't have to push any buttons on the earbuds when you take them out and put them back in.

All of the controls are on the small center discs on the outside of both earbuds. On the left earbud are 2 slightly raised ""bumps"", like those on the ""home"" keys (F and J) on a keyboard (see photos). The two raised button ""bumps"" control volume up/down and song ""next/previous"". To control volume you give quick successive presses which incrementally raises/lowers the volume with each quick press depending on which ""bump"" you are pressing. And to go back a song or forward to the next, you do long presses. To go back a song, long press the upper (left) button and to go to the next song, you do a long press on the lower (right) button.

The printed instructions (see photos) are erroneous for the right earpiece center disc control, which allows you to pause music and/or for phone calls. While music is playing a single press will pause for taking a phone call and then the instructions wrongly  indicate a double press to return to music. But that is not correct. To return to music, all it takes is another single press, which works as it should.  When I first started using them (due to the erroneous line drawing instructions) I tried to return to music with a double press, as directed, and nothing happened. When I tried a long press as an alternative, it disconnected me from BT, at which point I had to pair the set again in BT settings. So the instructions leave a bit to be desired in their lack of clarity or more in depth explanations. Subsequently I found out that the long press is meant to try to interface with the Jabra Sound+ app on my phone, in order to activate and control ""Hear Through"" and other features in the app.

And while I was first testing these, with the various button pushing steps above, at one point the volume dropped to a whisper and no matter what I tried, I could not get it to come back up to normal. After some research, which is not apparent in any printed instructions, I realized that it was due to me long pressing the right earbud button, which tried to access the Sound+ app on my Samsung. But since I had not yet downloaded Sound+, the earbuds went into a state of obvious confusion, and apparently dialing the music down in order to be able to ""Hear Through"". So, by un-pairing and turning the headphones off and then reactivating and renewing BT pairing, they came back to normal.

Regarding battery life, which is claimed to be 5 hours, I have not yet tested these to that limit. But the charging and storage pod which comes with these is really slick. The pod itself charges with a short USB cord (included). On a full charge, you can recharge your earbuds, on the go, through two full re-charges. One thing that I was not able to determine is this. Obviously one wants to store the earbuds in the small hardshell charging pod, when not in use, but I suspect the pod is going to charge the earbuds at all times that they are inserted. So, if the buds are partially depleted and you would prefer that they not be ""partially charged"" just to put them away, in order to insure that you always have 2 ""full recharges"" available in the pod, then how do you do that. No way to tell. So I think the moral of that story is, that if you know you are going to be away from a USB charging point for an extended period, then I would fully charge the buds and then remove them from the charging pod and then let the charging pod fully recharge without the buds in them, and then take off to wherever you are going. The pod does alert you to the battery level in the earbuds themselves, when inserted into the pod, with a green LED that briefly shines when inserted, to indicate that they are already fully charged. And on the outside bottom of the pod is an LED indicator light which lets you know the level of charge left in the pod, by way of pulsing red or green (for full charge).

One can potentially run for 15 hours with a fully charged pair, along with the two 5 hour reservoir charges available from the pod. That is far better than most other brands but below industry leading Apple AirPods which offer up to 25 hours.  But for most purposes, I can't imagine that making much of a difference to most users, unless you plan on being ""off the grid"" for an extended time for something like a wilderness trip.

In order not to lose the short USB cord, when the pod is not charging, I will use a small cinch bag to store the cord and charging pod. A minor detail that Jabra might have considered including. However, if you lose this one, you can use other micro USB chargers since the Jabra cord appears to be a standard micro USB, such as the one on my Samsung phone (but not compatible with Apple USB cords).

These are IP55 rated, meaning they can handle wearing in the rain or during a sweat filled workout, which is arguably better than Apple AirPods, which are reportedly somewhat fragile on that count, not being able to tolerate excessive sweating. And if you are overly concerned about moisture, you can step up to the Jabra Elite Sport, for more the robust resistance to moisture.

Getting to the sound quality on these, I was very impressed overall. I am a real gadget freak and sound devices addict, with many different headphones and headsets, some of which I have received at no charge from Amazon's Vine Program in return for unbiased and honest reviews of items received. Having been in the music business for 15 years with a chain of very large nightclubs nationwide, I have a knowledge of and an appreciation for what constitutes great sound versus run of the mill. And for the last 30 years I have been an avid lover of AKG wired headphones from Austria, as the owner of 4 different models in their lineup. I judge all others by their quality of sound.

As background to that, I was extremely surprised at the depth and quality of the bass response on these. They sounded very natural, unlike Bose headsets which are way overdriven in the bass spectrum, making Bose sound muddy and boomy, as they usually are. The mids and highs on the Jabra are very acceptable, ""out of the box"". However, I never listen to anything at home or on the go, without engaging manual EQ. I despise most all devices or software ""preset"" EQ's. They absolutely suck and offer no semblance of great balance which is best achieved with a concave bell curve (i.e. a shallow ""U"").  All 3 component sound systems in my home are set up with hardware equalizers, in line with amps.

Same on my Samsung and my Apple Air 2. On my Samsung I use what I consider to be the best music player out there, which is ""Rocket Player"" from JRT Studios. I eventually removed two other players from my phone after extensive use and disappointment for various reasons...Player Pro initially and then PowerAmp...both in favor of Rocket Player. At any rate, Rocket Player has a 10 band equalizer in it, which I can manually set, when listening to music, depending upon what I am listening with, which in this case, of course were the Jabra buds. When you EQ these buds, it takes them to an entirely different level of sound, which you normally could not achieve without spending 2-3xs the price for wired headphones. So I have absolutely no complaints about the quality of sound that these deliver. Listening to them, I feel like I am wearing expensive wired headphones.
Other than the shortcomings in the user instructions, I am very impressed with this set of wireless headphones, because of their sound, and their stable fit ""in the ear"", in which I barely notice them being there. And I absolutely love the compact clamshell storage and charging pod. Small enough that you don't notice it slipped into your pocket.

I will be using these exclusively on the go, now, instead of two other compact wireless earbuds which I have. One is a Tenergy T20 headset, which has ""wrap over the ear"" arms and a ""behind the ear"" vinyl cord, to insure they don't fall off. The T20 is mediocre, (gave them a 3 Star rating due to extremely overdriven bass). The second set of earbuds to be abandoned, is my Jaybird X2 Sport wireless headset, which feature wings which twist into the ear to hold them in place (in a very awkward and unstable way) The Jaybirds had great sound when EQ'd, but I did not like the fit, which took a lot of fiddling with to get them properly seated. I did give the Jaybirds a 5 Star due to their great sound, but I much prefer this new Jabra Elite 65t, as truly exceptional.

Speaking of Jabra, in the past, I have also received a free pair of Jabra's Evolve 75 traditional headphones with microphone set in the Amazon Vine Program (designed for open office use for phone call usage). I gave them a dismal 1 Star rating because I could never get them to connect to my computer with the dongle that they provide, nor could I get them to connect by BT to my phone, which they were supposedly able to do. Never got a chance to test them in action. So it is refreshing to find that these are pretty much flawless

Purchase these. You will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_264?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=264&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One of the few, and my first Bluetooth 5.0 headphones, are IP55 dust and sweat resistant. Batteries last about five hours and the case provides two extra charges. They come with four microphones (two per unit) for excellent voice calls and noise conditioning. The earphones come with three sizes of ear tips and provide a tight but comfortable fit, with a closed design for passive noise cancellation. The sound is very natural and detailed. Through the companion phone app, there is a five-band equalizer. Earpieces are relatively light and stay on. I find it comfortable to wear through the day. The left earpiece has two controls for volume and tracks, the right piece has a single button for play/pause and calls. Pairing with an iPhone was straightforward, with good range and no drops. Newer phones with BT 5.0 can have better range and power efficiency. IPhone 8 and X supports BT 5.0, but not required. Works perfectly with older phones as well. It can connect to two devices at the same time. While the phone provides a battery indicator for the earphones, the Jabra Sound+ app provides detailed battery info, the five-band EQ, lets you select the voice assistant when pressing the multi-function button on the right earpiece: Siri or Google depending on the phone or Amazon's Alexa (Not yet enabled on iOS), and very neat features like HearThrough and Sidetone: HearThrough: While the headphones provide passive noise cancellation, HearThrough uses the microphones to let some of the external sounds in. This is turned on or off by double-tapping the multi-function button or through the app, which lets adjust the amount of audio through. Sidetone: When on a call, adjusts how much of your own voice is fed back through the earphones. Audio calls work great. With the four mics, it isolates wind noise. Then the little details is what makes these excellent earphones great. When taking the earphones off the case, they start pairing with the phone, and they turn off when back on the case. Then when the earphones are in close proximity of each other (ie in the ears) it resumes playing music. It pauses the music if one takes one of the earpieces off, and resumes again if back within a few seconds. The case is small enough to fit in one hand. It has an LED next to the charge port to indicate charge levels, and another indicator between the earpieces that indicates their charge.

They are very touchy when it comes to connectivity. But I'm going to experiment with them and update further. On a positive note, the sound quality is nice. They definitely remain in the ear during physical activity. I use them on a whole body vibration machine and I didn't notice them being in my ear except for the music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I usually have an issue with in-ears staying in my ears but these sit rock solid. They do not move a bit. Unfortunately, they have one major design flaw and I ended up returning them.

Sound quality would be ok. Nothing spectacular but acceptable even if you are used to high end headphones. You do need to test the different tip sizes to get the best sound. This was the first set of earbuds where I needed to go with the largest set of tips. With the medium size ear tips I was missing some bass.

But the main issue that made me return them was the imbalance between left and right speaker. If you look through the web you will find quite a few people complaining about the same issue: the left earbud is slightly too loud. This is particularly apparent when you have hear-through enabled. You end up hearing the noise floor primarily on the left side. This is why some people say that there is a hiss on the left earbud. But the problem is actually a consistent imbalance between left and right channels.

It appears that this is an issue on the hardware side. At least Jabra has not yet been able to correct that with a firmware fix, even though the issue has been reported ever since these came on the market.

The imbalance is minor and not completely off-putting. If you are a casual listener you might not even notice. And there are quite a few people who treat the problem by going into the accessibility options of the phone and correcting the imbalance there. But for earbuds that expensive I felt that this was a workaround I was not willing to take. So they had to go back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After reading reviews from a variety of sources, I bought the Jabra Elite 65t. I listen primarily to rock music. I found the sound a bit tinny on first listen but the application that comes with the earbuds allows for adjustments that ameliorated that. It’s a nice feature. For me, the main issue with these earbuds was comfort. After about an hour, it became uncomfortable to keep them in my ears. I never had that problem with Apple EarPods when I used them with foam covers. If the Jabras had been more comfortable, I might have kept them although they felt a bit loose and a little clunky in my ears, which are somewhat on the large side. The Jabra sound was pretty good with the adjustments. The Bluetooth connection was easy. I returned the Jabras and bought Apple AirPods. Their sound is good and the fit is comfortable for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_329?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=329&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately this was not the case.  These buds did not fit the my anatomy - did not stay securely in place - even after trying 2 of the accompanying multiple rubber tip sizes.  I could not get a tight, secure anatomical fit in the ear canal opening and the buds kept slipping and eventually falling out into my one of my waiting hands during a run or gym workout ... just didn't work for me.  Also, the earbud seemed generally larger and felt heavier than other buds I've seen/tried before this purchase.  Disappointing.

To be fair, the sound quality and technical features were very good, and the noise cancellation [choice] worked well to block out overhead gym music and traffic.  Also, setup and pairing time were extremely easy, short and efficient right out of the box - loved this aspect.  However, my 3 star rating was based primarily on the dominant ergonomics and design issue.

Earlier this summer, when these were first delivered, I was travelling extensively and simply did not pause to try the buds, so by the time I did open the box, it was a few weeks later.  Usually, I do check a delivered item immediately upon receipt just in case there's an issue.  Moreover, I wanted to give the buds several 'tries' before passing judgement, ... hoping that these would eventually somehow form to my ear opening.  Therefore, it's now too late to return.  My hope is to sell for a great low price online to try to recoup at least a bit of my cost, as I do think these will fit someone somewhere given the multiple earbud tips.

To note, a positive shout out to Jabra tech service; they were all great - professional, friendly, patient, and helpful.  However, understandably, they do not take returns when their product is purchased through Amazon.  If I would have purchased through Jabra, they may have exchanged for another Jabra model.  They did provide a discount for another Jabra product - unsolicited by me - which was very nice.  But, I will not be buying another earbud product from any company until I can sell these Jabra buds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I run 5k every other day with mixed exercise on other days and these have been solid, never slipping, popping out or requiring adjustment during exercise. The sound quality is good, not great, but in line with expectations for a blue tooth set. I do note a couple of small issues that keep these a four star, rather than five star, product.

First they do cut out briefly from time to time. It's usually not more than a fraction of a second but it's noticeable and repetitive under certain circumstances. The left headphone also occasionally fails to connect when turning them on and requires they be returned to the charging kit to ""reset"" them.

Otherwise they've performed well.

I will also note that the accompanying software (Jabra Sound +) is quite good. The hear through mode works very well and the concentration modes (providing air tight white noise that almost kills ANY background noise) are quite remarkable.

With a firmware update or two these could be a near runaway winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was pleased with the sound quality, noise isolation, and calling features.  A month ago, and abruptly, I started having an issue where the volume in the left ear was noticeably louder than the volume in the right ear.  There was a firmware update in mid-October that Jabra claimed would fix that problem.  To be clear, I didn't have this problem before the firmware update or for a couple weeks after installing it.  A quick search will reveal a number of people who are dealing with the exact same problem.  Before contacting Jabra I tried some of the steps suggested to remedy the problem, but none worked so I finally contacted Jabra online because I hate getting tech support over the phone.  It took a week to get a response, and when they responded they suggested the steps I had already tried.  When I wrote back to say that I had tried all of the suggestions and the issue, I got another email back a week later essentially saying ""are you sure you followed the directions exactly"", which I had on at least 5 occasions.  I responded to that email today and now I'm awaiting their response, which I hope will involve sending in my earphones for replacement.  I strongly suspect that this is a firmware type of defect and not hardware.  Occasionally I get a good balance when I first take the earphones out of the charging case, but it never lasts more than 10 minutes.  I often listen to podcasts with only one earbud when doing stuff around the house and I have to jack the volume up almost to the max to get a normal volume level.  I'll try to come back and make an update to this review with the outcome.  For now I'd say avoid this product, or at least search the issue and see comments from others about the problem.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

• good sound
• inner ear buds to stay in place (not like apple’s )
 • good battery life

These met all of my criteria and have really impressed me. The sound is good and the battery life is great. They’re fine for taking calls also - not as great as my Bluetooth for background noise cancellation but just as good as headphones. I have no complaints on this product and I’ve had them for about 3 weeks. I use them everyday for about 3.5 hours and only have to charge them ever couple of days as long as I store them in their case since it serves as a backup charger. The battery life is fantastic. I tried another cheaper version of a product like this on Amazon. I went by the reviews (4.5 stars) and $50 and I returned them because they would t last more than 1 hour after being charged. These stand out even more because of that point of comparison. I also love that they’re fairly discreet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

PROS:
- Great sound quality
- Mic WORKS (THIS IS A BIG DEAL)
- Battery lasts
- Setup easy
- App/Customization is nice
- Snug in-ear fitting

CONS:
- NOT magnetized to the charger (meaning they don't lock in and you can't guarantee its being charged)
- Charger is PLASTIC (with plastic hinging and that will not last)
- Bottom of charger is ROUNDED (can't have it sitting on the desk with earbuds charging between use
- Charging indicator lights are not intuitive

Seriously... if Jabra fixes the Cons (easy fixes) and these will be THE BEST!

I have had them for a little more than a week of heavy use. This is the first pair of bluetooth headphones I have owned. Before this I used plug in ear buds. I listen to music and a lot of podcasts, neither of which my family or coworkers want to hear. These produce far richer sound than my Sony or Skull Candy earbuds. The Jabra app is a must. I'm sure you can connect these to your phone without the app, but the app has a variety of features that allow you to enhance and customize your listening experience and also manage firmware updates. In addition to those features, there are ambient sound options that are pretty cool. You can listen to the sounds of rain, a thunderstorm, ocean waves, cavern etc to help you focus on work or meditate or whatever.
Other reviewers have raved about the battery life. I have not run out of battery while using them yet and I listen for hours at a time. When I'm finished, I pop them back in the case and they charge back up.

Having buttons on the earbuds to control volume, advance tracks, take calls, manage voice features, etc is essential. Some people complain about discomfort pushing the buttons forces the earbuds into your ear canals. I can see that this might be annoying, but it wasn't that bad for me. Maybe my ears are less sensitive to this sensation.

I also give high marks to the phone handling and voice command. I have placed and received calls. Sound quality is good and the caller reports to me that they can hear me well. I am increasingly using Google by voice and it works well with these Jabra earbuds.

Here are a couple of things I think could be improved. First, these earbuds do a pretty good job of canceling outside ambient sound and isolating you. Because you sometimes want that sound to filter through to be aware of what is happening around you, they have a feature called ""HearThrough"" that utilizes the microphones and mixes the ambient sound from your surroundings with the music or whatever you are actively listening to and passes them through to your ears. It's not perfect. Sometimes it's spotty. It seems to drop out sometimes, the things I want to hear most (other people talking to me) is sometimes quiet and random noise is louder. I also wish that the app would allow you to control the volume of the ambient sound separately from the audio coming from your device.

I have not been successful connecting to my PC. I assume this is possible, but the computer doesn't have a driver for these and I have not yet found one online (I only searched for about 10 minutes).

I had trouble opening the case at first. I have seen other reviewers who also complain about this. The secret is to push on the ridge. The clasp is secure so your earbuds don't just fall out. Pushing back on the lid as you open it releases the clasp. It's easy once you know this.

I had some issues with the bluetooth stability. I have read that it might be a problem with Samsung phones rather than with the Jabra 65t. Resetting the bluetooth on my phone (toggling off and on again) seems to help. I also experienced some interfearance while sitting next to a TV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The fact that it isn't USB-C is a miss.

The fact that they have ""Jabra"" branding on them, in a silver/steel color, makes them look very cheap. The look of the earbuds and the case is just very cheap looking.

The case is such a pain to open. I learned how to get it open eventually but it is not intuitive ""push from bottom"" to open, more a ""swipe its side"" motion.

The twisting motion to insert them is awkward. And these hurt my ears after wearing for more than an hour. They fit too well. The noise cancellation works VERY WELL, but that is not a feature I need for daily commute.

The absolute last straw that made me return these is the buttons. The buttons are physical, and pressing them will jam the buds into your ear even more. It hurts.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_323?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=323&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I researched these with various other competitors for this product and pretty much received the impression that there was a good probability of some fake reviews or at least some that were incentive based in some way.  I had already tried one of the cheaper brands and returned them immediately for lack of bass and sound quality.  This product, however did not disappoint.  I have been using these in the office today and have the jabra app enabled for this device.  The sound quality and function of these are spot on.  I have a critical ear, so sound quality is important.  The fit is perfect out of the box for me.... and a variety of ear pieces accompany the product for an alternate fit for different individuals.  When you take one out, the sound is paused until you re-insert and press button on outside of ear bud.... which is really kewl!

I did read that there were some balance issues from other users. One ear bud sounding louder than the other one. Multiple tips recommended from updating firmware, resetting earbods, unpairing bluetooth, re installing english language. This only worked temporarily.
I contacted 4 times customer support. They gave me instructions but sooner or later same thing happened.

So I decided to go to Android sound settings and calibrate it for the sound to be louder in the right than the left and that seemed to take care of it. But then a hissing sound started. I called customer support and they guided me once again how to reboot, update firmware, yara yara yara.... worked again for a couple of days then the hissing started again.

So, now here I am, not sure how much time I have wasted with this product and I contact them again and they give me the same algorithm instructions...

Honestly the sound is good, and they are a decent pair but I have been dealing with these issues since very early in their life. I was going to buy the apple earpods because that is almost always GUARANTEE quality.

Do I regret buying these? Most definitely. If I hear back from customer support and they decide to change my earbuds even for refurbished once Ill consider changing this rating. For now... Im sick and tired.

Sound 4/5
Customer Support 2/5
Pleased with product... Obviously a damn zero. About to throw them to the trash

Update: Got a replacement after talking with customer support and the problems have now resolved. Happy with the sound and if this would have been my first experience I would have rated it a 5 and for that reason i am increasing it to that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_303?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=303&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Volume up down on left bud is not super convenient to use, you have to feel around to press the right place. I use the volume buttons on my phone. The hear through feature is only useful if you have the level of your music quite low. Flawless initial connection to iPhone when first put on. Very easy to pause quickly.

They have never steered me wrong. The left ear is not as tight as my right ear. Maybe Jabra will read this and offer a solution? To sum up, if you’re put off by the price don’t be.

I find that the headphones produce a great sound and have had no issues with pairing and bluetooth.

My issue is that they constantly fall out.

Regardless of which earbud size I use (it comes with 3 different sizes), none will hold the earbud in my ear well enough. If I talk at all, the earbuds will slowly work themselves out of my ear. If I'm ""active"" and moving around I can feel them slowly working their way out. It drives me to be paranoid and constantly pushing it further into my ear, to no avail. God forbid you want to eat something with the earbuds in, because they just fall right out.

I don't think I have particularly weird size ears, and have never had any issues with any wired earbuds, so it's frustrating that these are so expensive and won't even do one of the basic tenets of an earbud: staying in your ear..","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_313?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=313&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was trying to lay back in a recliner and found that they would cut in and out when laying back but if I brought the recliner to the upright position they worked better but still crackled once in a while. Seriously Jabra, for $170 these should not perform like this. Connecting to a device is also an issue. Most of the time it can take 1 -2 dozen tries or 10-15 minutes.  Consumers should not have to go through this when spending this high amount. I will be taking them back.  Too bad. I really wished they had worked out.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_273?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=273&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1.- Molestia en los odios: Se adecuan bien al tamaño de los oídos, a pesar que no estoy acostumbrado a los audífonos in ear, los cuales siempre me causan molestias, estos por el contrario han sido muy cómodos aún al usarlos por horas.
2.- Molesto para oídos pequeños: Las almohadillas fueron un inconveniente al principio, mi canal auditivo está justo entre el tamaño M y L, me tomó un tiempo definir cual de las dos era más conveniente.
3.- Reducción de ruido: La reducción de ruido es muy buena, en el caso de estos audífonos es pasiva, y al seleccionar el tamaño de almohadilla adecuada funcionan muy bien. Precisamente este fue el motivo por el cual decidí comprar este modelo, llevaba meses trabajando frente a una construcción escuchando el ruido por 9hrs al día y llegó el momento en que cualquier sonido me era molesto. Estos audífonos ayudaron mucho a reducir el ruido ambiental, inclusive en el metro.
4.- El peligro de no escuchar lo que pasa alrededor: La función de escuchar el entorno requiere cierta mejora, al activarla amplifica un poco el sonido del aire, un detalle que puede resolverse con una actualización de software, aunque este detalle te ayuda a saber que la función está activa y en general funciona excelente. El poder configurar el nivel de intensidad es muy útil para los diferentes ambientes: gimnasio, calle u oficina.
5.- NR activa: No posee reducción de ruido activa, aunque pareciese que el hardware es capaz de soportar esta función. Es una lástima.

En general, los audífonos superaron mis expectativas y disiparon mis temores, son muy cómodos, excelentes para hacer ejercicio en el gimnasio, una calidad e intensidad de sonido muy buena, la batería realmente dura lo que promete y más.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tried three wireless headsets over the years (that wrap around the neck) and in each case one side stopped working after ~5-7 months (i.e. no sound coming out of one earbud) but I will say that I used them a lot, both at work and at the gym.
Not with these! Not only are they VERY comfortable but I've had them for several months now without any problems. I mostly use them at the gym and haven't had any problems with them falling out of my ear while on the treadmill or lifting for the most part.
The sound is also EXCELLENT and the noise cancellation is superb. No issues with the bluetooth connection.

(Sad face)","These are the best BT ear buds I have had in a while.Great but not awesome for one reason only, that is having not noise canceling... I mean all the manufacturers have gone to this""noise canceling as in cancels sound around you from being heard to the listener. Well that is great, but isn't that an inherent trait of an in ear bud? My issue is outside noises heard to the recipient on the phone. I mean I literally watched 100 + video reviews on these this on Youtube before dropping almost $200 aaagain on some buds. No one, and I MEAN NO ONE tested these in a real noisy environment to see what the recipient heard!!! So I rolled the dice... Again... Real world these this are good for a lot of people, comfort, style (not giant bugger hanging out of your head, Air Pods...), and overall performance. All the listed features are great and perform well too. Okay so how is it Jabra can do such and amazing job at making these things perform against wind noise but other noises are... ready...? AMPLIFIED to the recipient on the phone!!!! I mean they did a stellar job on the wind noise reduction as in driving down the road in my car at 60+ MPH with the front windows down all the way and they hear nothing stellar!!! Now on the other hand if I am in the shop (automotive) it is like a ear blast to the person I am on the phone with and they can not hear me, but the pneumatic tool sounds are super clear and crisp... LOL... That one draw back prevents the 5 star rating! The only buds I have had that were able to do that was the first gen Jaybird buds but they picked up wind noise and not true wireless, oh and not around any more. The Jaybird X3 don't even bother on outside noise cancellation to the recipient. Well I just wish these manufacturers would ""listen"" to a call and say hmmm, I bet there are a lot of people that would pay more for this if they actually did these functions!

However, there seems to be something wrong with mine. I went into the app to update the setting for hear through (both earbuds in but you can still hear the noise around you) and it just doesn't work. I've compared the settings to my boyfriend's set up and it's identical. I've listened to his and it works perfectly. On mine it just doesn't work, period.

I also wanted to be able to use just one earbud for everything and from the description I thought that was possible but it's not. I'm not super technical, but my understanding was that the left bud was the ""slave"" so if you put that in the case and use just the right one it will function fully on its own. Not so. I can listen to music, podcasts, etc with just the right earbud in, but I CANNOT answer to make phone calls with just the one. I can't talk on the phone with two earbuds in, it just drives me crazy the way it sounds and I yell too loudly but since it doesn't work with just the right bud if the phone rings or I need to make a call I have to put it in the charging case and just use the phone. Annoying. If they work properly, like the do for my boyfriend, they're worth the money. If the functions don't all work properly, like they don't for me, they're definitely not worth almost two hundred dollars.

I like the size and convenience, but they pick up and transmit way too much background noise during calls. For example, when I'm at the grocery store talking to my wife over the earbuds, sounds that are not overly loud in the store (a grocery cart going by, kids laughing) come across to her as incredibly loud and I have to move away from the sound source to continue the conversation.

I did some research and decided to overlook the few negative reviews and see how they worked in my situations. I sleep with headphones in so they needed to be comfortable and secure inside my ear without being painful and also sound-blocking. I got all of those things from these headphones.
Note: If you put these headphones in incorrectly, they WILL be painful. I am a female and I have smaller ears and before I realized I was putting them in wrong, they were a bit painful. Once that was fixed, I never had another issue with them being painful.

The primary issue I've had is that I lose them pretty often but I can't knock Jabra for that. I have noticed every once in a while that the left ear will very very slightly buzz but I seat it back in the case, take it out again, no more buzzing.

ALSO!! Note that Jabra has updated the firmware on these at least 3 times so they're always improving.

Sound quality is a non-issue for me because I'm not exactly an audiophile but these are on-par or outperforming the BeatsX and AirPods (both of which I have used). No M1 chip in these but you can still check the battery levels from the swipe down menu on iOS. They instantly connect as soon as I remove the right earbud from the case. Seamless.

Very pleased overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That’s where most of the problem is though, the fit just isn’t very good.

It’s hard to get a good seal and they often feel awkward from left to right. I found myself fidgeting with the left one all the time and it was never really comfortable. For short listening periods it was tolerable but they definitely became painful after about an hour. I was mainly comparing these to the Bose and they paled in comparison.

Call quality wasn’t good either. I ended up returning mine when people were saying they couldn’t hear me. Sorry but Jabra specializes in headsets for phones calls why wouldn’t they at least get that right?

why i give it 3 stars:
1. when you wear it for long time it gets uncomfortable  because it seal the ear canal which is good cancel any noise around you but not for along time.
2. the main bud is the right one and cannot use the left one alone only the right and when you pull out of your ears it pause the video/audio but of forgot to return them to your ears for long period of time the left bud will lose connection and turn off and even if you turn them off manuallly it will not reconnect only the right bud will get connected you will need the charging box to reset them by put them both inside take them out no sure i that will be solved with an update or not so it will be a con until its fixed if possible.
3. when its in my pocked like all other wireless headphone there will be some time some drops in connection and as i noticed it deponds how you put your phone in your pocket and  i think thats depends where is you Bluetooth receiver inside your phone i use one plus 3t i know am being harsh with this point but i needed to clear that out because some people and youtube reviewers will tell it Bluetooth 5 and its better but in real world nothing is perfect.
4. And yes the fall of very easy i you opend the charging box becasue there is not magnatic holder or whatever it name and that is major design flow from jabra

These earbuds block out sound, stay charged, and have excellent musical quality.  I haven't charged the case in over a week.  I've used them for approximately five to six hours over the last week, and they still had 94% charge when I started the Jabra app yesterday.  I do recommend, if you purchase these, to download the Jabra Sound+ app.  The earbuds aren't rocket science to operate to begin with, but the app makes it child's play.  If you are on the fence about spending $170 on these, having this experience, I wouldn't hesitate to do so again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_337?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=337&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am a picky purchaser, and I don't just buy a product because it's trendy. I've done my research. Not only do these Jabra Elite 65t fit perfectly, they do everything they're supposed to do! Noise cancelling? Check! Sound quality (including a healthy dose of base)? Check!  Moisture Wicking? Let's just say, I use these a lot in the gym. I run; I lift (including inverted exercises); I sweat extensively. Never once have the Jabra Elite 65t earbuds fallen out. Never. My gym often has music and commercials playing that I don't care for - guess what: I seriously don't hear them, and I'm not cranking the volume either. The battery lasts just as advertised. Syncing is really easy (all the functions are). I have only experienced interference a couple of times, bit the majority of the times, I leave my phone in my gym bag at the station I'm working on, and I can walk to pick up weight-plates or do another exercise up to 25' away sometimes without loosing signal.

I definitely recommend these!

I have had the Jabra Elite Active 65t's for 2-3 months I think. I have carry them in my pocket and use them every single day. I use them for about 1-3 hrs a day to listen to podcast, music (metal & rap), and phone calls. After installing the Jabra app you can tune the earbuds to the music or audio source you are listening to so that all music or audio sources sound good coming through. I all through high school hated earbud because they would always fall out of my ear so getting these I was worried they wouldn't stay in but after putting on the smaller tips and figuring out how to put them in correctly I can now say they fit great and don't fall out when I wobble or shake my head. I have not ran with them in or used them out on a rainy day.

The earbuds stay charged for 3.5-4.5 hrs from what I noticed. I took a flight to NYC which was 5-6 hrs due to a delay and after what feels like using them all 5-6 hrs they never died. the carry case was charged before the trip but I never charged the earbud case while taking this trip plus the flight back and the earbuds still never died or needed to be charged.

NEGATIVE:
Only thing about the earbuds that I don't like which is also one of if not the biggest factor in me buying them is the mic quality for calls / talking. While the mic talk quality is average at best which isn't a bad thing this mic is EXTREMELY sensitive to outside sounds and there is nothing I have been able to find that will fix that. I talk to a buddy of mine every day and he has told me countless times that he is going deaf just talking to me on the phone. Everything in my background gets picked up such as fans, cars, birds, wing, and more. At my job I have to open big bay doors manually and the simple clanking of the metal chains which i'm trying carefully not to make much noise with he say's blows his eardrums out. I have called tech support lines for help with product issues and just being in a moving car is enough for them to ask me to take my phone off ""speaker"" because they can't hear me.
These earbuds pick out all sounds even the smallest noises possible so i'd only be able to recommend this mic for maybe a guy or girl who works in a quiet office setting who needs a mic they doesn't cut out so people can hear you clearly.

Other then the mic being sensitive everything else about these earbuds I have liked and would still recommend if you want good wireless earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't know how people on here say that these earbuds stay very secure in your ears during workouts. I find the exact opposite. They constantly fell out while running on the treadmill and I had to chase them down. I then decided to just use them only while lifting weights. Once again they constantly loosened up and would fall out. I had would have to readjust them constantly after and during sets to the point I just put them in my pocket. Just to give them a thorough trial, I tried all of the different size tips. The ones that came already installed seemed to be the best fit. The large tips were to big and wouldn't insert into my ears at all. The small ones were way to loose and fell out immediately. I even tried swapping tips from other brands that I currently own but none would hold them in my ears. The quality, sound and features were great, that's why I'm giving them a rating of 3.

Sound is terrific and the fit is the most confortable I have experienced on earphones this small. I have read so many complains on amazon customers and about this no lasting but I have had my first pair for over a year and no issues so far. Every now and then when I make a call I ask my friends if they can hear me and they say that the call is incredibly clear then I show them the kind of Bluetooth I’m wearing and they do not believe how is it possible the they can hear me so clear with something so small. Now regarding fit with this some people might find this a little too big but I would say that these are perfect for me and they look super sexy on people's ear. So futuristic and stylish. I can’t wait for Jabra to see their next version although I think that these are just perfect. I’m a very happy customer and I felt like sharing my comment just because I hate so many false reviews that makes no sense to me since I own two pair of these. One for the gym and one for work and they work and sound just great. Way better than apple AirPods and I’m a very fan of apple products but Jabra stepped up on this with better product. I really hope my review will help more people and try for themselves rather than pay attention to nonsense reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_317?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=317&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wound up taking a nail file and filing down the hook on the lid.  Now it works fine.

Another issue, and perhaps its my ears, the ear pods hurt my ears.  The smallest nodule was still a bit uncomfortable.  I finally just removed them, altogether.  I haven't used them outside or exercising since doing this.  I usually just wear them in bed at night to listen to ebooks.  I'm sure when i use them for the first time outside, i will have too much ambient noise and will put the nodules back on.

You know, i don't really know how good any of these products are supposed to sound, so i can't rate that aspect.  I also have a 30$ pair that seems to sound just as good.

These had a similar problem to other headsets where background noise was amplified during a call, as if the sound passthrough was turned on and couldn't be turned off.  Even with 4 microphones, there seemed to be no distinction between ambient noise and my voice. The biggest problem I had with the Jabra Elite 65T was the fit; The headphones stayed in my ears better than expected, but the hard plastic casing pressed against cartilage above my ear canal, causing soreness and tenderness after a very short period of time, no amount of adjusting could fix this so I was forced to return them.

On the positive side, the sound quality was very good, the noise passthrough worked well when listening to music, and the volume went sufficiently high. If you do not need to make calls outside of a silent office and don't have the fitment problems that I had, then these could be worth your while.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_273?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=273&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So, why  a 4 star review? I usually exercise in a hoodie, and when I keep my phone in my left pocket, the connection cuts out often enough to be annoying. It always  cuts out if I turn my head to the right. If I put my phone in the right pocket, it works perfectly. I seems obvious that the pairing happens with the right ear phone. I always keep my phone in my left pant pocket, so it's a bit inconvenient to switch it to the right side, and have my keys on the left, but it's vital with these. It's an important detail that you should be aware of, but not a deal breaker by any means.

Other than that (small) gripe, these are great for my tastes. I bought them based on the glowing Wirecutter review. In that review they mention that the battery life is about 5 hours, but I've found mine last much longer. The fit is snug, and these don't fall out, even when running. For a Bluetooth headphone, the sound is practically crystal clear. And, they seem to block out external noise almost *too* well. (I'm not sure if that's a problem because my neighborhood is pretty mellow -- I know there's a pass-through option/button press, but I haven't used it.)

I definitely think these are worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_319?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=319&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Aside, from the filthy condition of the unboxed earbuds, the quality of the call is a little distorted and several times callers had to repeatedly say “hello hello ! I’m not hearing you clearly you sound far or there is allot of background noise. And hardly hearing the voice. ” I do not rate these earbuds for making calls however the mids range sound in the speaker is sharp with a moderate amount of base clear enough to enjoy.

 It also lets background noise in from the app. Also because they fit to fill the space in your ears they act well at cancelling noise. Because they carry a little weight they can fall out your ears if the cushion gets moist feom sweat while running.

The tracking feature is pointless if they are in the case and not connected to a paired device. Not too impressed by that. It’s gimmicks for selling points.

I love these earbuds. They work wonders at the gym. They stay in place during a workout (with a few adjustments every 20 minutes or so). The sweat proof feature means I don’t have to worry on those days I’m drenched in sweat. The sound quality is great. I would like to be able to turn them up a little louder but the max volume they have is fine. They also do a good job with noise isolation. I see some reviewers saying the Jabras hurt their ears after a while and I can see how they might, but to me it’s no big deal. They are intuitive, simple to use, and well made. They synchronization between the two buds is perfect. Battery life is great. Call quality on both ends is good. There is no lack of good things I can say about these earbuds.
THINGS I DONT LIKE:
The control buttons on the earbuds to me are useless because when you press them you force the earbud into your ear canal which I find very uncomfortable; I would have preferred touch controls.
The earbuds are not held magnetically in the case and will fall out if the case opens up unexpectedly.
These are not Bluetooth 5.0

Other than that I cannot recommend these enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_281?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=281&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had three pairs of the wired (together) Bluetooth Bose Soundsport headphones prior to purchasing the Jabra Active 65t.  Consumer reviews slated Jabra as the top contender in Bluetooth in-ear headphones, so I bought them.  (The Bose Soundports were incredibly comfortable and had stellar sound quality, but ended up losing Bluetooth connectivity mid-call somewhat regularly, after a while... additionally, the clips that attach the cord to the back of your shirt are super poorly made, and before replacing each pair of Bose headphones, I probably bought 6-8 replacement clips.  I was tired of replacing clips, without which, the sound is muffled by the mic resting on your shirt collar, unless you hold the mic away from your clothes, at which point, you may as well be on a handset.)

Notwithstanding, there's no disputing the Jabra's sound quality, and I really like the ""Hear Through"" option, which engages the microphones on the ear buds to amplify the sounds around you, while you have the headphones in (great safety feature when wanting to walk/run, talk/listen to music, and still be aware of your surroundings).  The charging case increases battery life significantly, another positive feature.  The fact that you can customize the EQ is also a lovely option.

I love many things about these headphones, but the Bose are SIGNIFICANTLY more comfortable in-ear headphones.  Even on the smallest ear pad setting on the Jabra, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to sit with these headphones in for prolonged periods of time, not to mention that the act of putting them in/taking them out of my ears is actually becoming increasingly more painful by the day.

None of these headphones are cheap, so my primary complaint with the Jabra 65t's is the comfort (or lack thereof).  For that reason, I will not buy these again unless they redesign the in-ear pad section, and I would encourage others to keep looking unless you know they fit your ears like a glove.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also have a pair of Bose QuetComfort wireless over-ear headphone, which I thought could not be beat.  However, they are bulky and so I splurged on these based on reviews and personal recommendations.  I couldn't be happier and in fact, because of their size and ease of use, they have largely replaced use of my Bose.  They sound great and once you get used to the controls, they are easy to use.  I belive a person with large fingers, might find the subtleties of the buttons a bit challenging because I did at first, myself and I have very small fingers/hands.  With that said, the volume button is easy enough and if you want to stop the music, you just take one of the ear buds out and the music pauses - starting up again when you replace it in your ear, as long as you don't wait a long time.  The battery life is decent.  Certainly enough for a cross-country flight, but not nearly as long as the Bose.  The case that comes with it is compact and serves to charge up the buds when not in use, approximately two full charges in the case itself and you can charge the buds and case simultaneously.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and bought another pair as a gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I read several reviews and these seem to foot the bill although I was a bit skeptical after reading several horrible reviews about these earbuds. I’ve used these for about a month and overall I’m very pleased with them. Listed below is what I like and don’t like about these earbuds.

What I like about these earbuds:
- Good sound quality – I’m no audiophile but the sound is crisp and clear.
- In-ear stability - I like how they fit in my ear, I have used them for about a month and I haven’t felt like the earbuds will fall off, they’re very stable.  Please note that at least 2 different women have tried using my earbuds and they WON’T fit them, they’re too big for them.
- Great battery life – I use them roughly 5 hours a day and they haven’t died on my once. I charge them daily just to make sure they’ll be ready to go the following day.

What I don’t like about these earbuds:
- Spotty Bluetooth - When I first got them, they paired without any issues to my cellphone (Huawei Honor 10 Lite). I charged them for the next day, in the morning, I could no longer pair them with the phone. I had to download the app to pair them with my phone. I’ve seen others complaint about this issue.
- Charging case – Very hard to open the case to charge the earbuds, also, there’s no indication on the case as to the percentage charging of the ear buds. If the earbuds have been fully charged, the light should remain green or red if they need charging.
- I have to adjust the sound every time I use them – They should be able to keep my sound settings from the last time I used them.
- Left earbud has to be turned “on” every time I use them – After I turn them on and pair them with the phone, I also have to turn “on” the left earbud as well. It’s annoying having to do this on a daily basis when I get ready to wear them, why can’t both earbuds turn on once you pair them?
- The mic – People have a hard time hearing me, I find myself speaking louder than I normally speak to resolve this issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_311?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=311&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was money well spent on a pair of truly wireless earphones, with excellent sound quality and more than decent battery life. Additionally, the build quality is quite good and they certainly don't feel cheap like many of the other earphones out there. However, I have a couple of minor gripes/complaints. First of all, the charging case is sturdy enough but feels like the top lid will break easily, as it doesn't close all that tightly. Second, I really don't enjoy the piercing high pitch tone that is emitted when you first place these in your ears. And finally, I wouldn't recommend these too much for outdoor walking/running/jogging as I get a lot of dropouts, as the sound cuts in and out while I'm moving around outside. However, this is somewhat dependent on the outdoor conditions and what type of material/fabric I'm wearing, and I also noticed that after I updated to the latest firmware (by using their official android app), that there have been about 50% less dropouts compared to before. To sum it all up, for anyone out there looking for great quality earphones with overall better sound (especially mids and bass) than apple's airpods, the Jabra Elite are a must buy :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My review will use them as a basis of comparison.

The first thing to notice is that the case for these is considerably more bulky than the AirPod case. It doesn’t open as easily and the ear buds do not feel as secure in it.

The next thing to notice is that these fill your ear canal like ear plugs. There is an nice option in the app that allows you to “hear through” them, but it sometimes takes a minute for that feature to kick in when you first put them in your ears. This feature is not a default. You have to turn it on through the app. Otherwise, yes, they cancel out a lot of noise.

They seem to fit pretty snugly in the ear and even though they don’t have the longer stem like the AirPods do, the audio quality seems to be good when talking through them on the phone.

The “ear detection” seems to cheat a little as it sometimes activates just by being in your fingers. It also mean it sometimes won’t auto-pause when you take them out because it thinks it’s still in your ear when it’s actually in your hand.

The controls are a nice touch. The tapping of the AirPods is a slick feature, but has it’s limitations. Having a push-button in your right ear that you can press to play/pause or long hold to bring up Siri is kinda nice. The left ear has tiny volume buttons that you can also long hold to track skip forward or back. I admittedly don’t use them as much as you’d think I would since I got used to using the phone controls with the AirPods.

You can use them in just one ear as I often do. I use the right side typically though it seems like it might work left-ear-only as well.

Overall, I’m not sure that these are necessarily better than the AirPods, though there are a lot of things they do better such as the controls, noise cancelation and they don’t stick out of your ear as much.

If you are looking for an alternative to the AirPods then these are definitely what you are looking for. They are not always as quick to connect and not always as responsive, but they are close enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_302?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=302&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These headphones deliver great sound quality for various music types and frequency ranges. They were a bit uncomfortable at first, but I got used to them after 1-2 days. Stay in your ears throughout workouts and commutes. Bluetooth sometimes gets light interference from elevator and subway motors, but overall they stay connected at all times.

The sound quality is great, I like the Jabra app that allows you to adjust the amount of ambient noise that is transmitted with your music, and I haven't had any issues getting them to connect to my phone.

I have two complaints: 1) the case is such a pain in the neck to open. They say you push this little tab and it will open - that doesn't work. I have to slide my thumb nails in the crack and push up that way. If I painted my nails this would ruin them and that would be annoying. 2) The microphone is too sensitive. I've used them a couple of times to talk on the phone and both people have commented on how loud all the background noise is. I was in the car and my daughter said that the turn signal was extremely loud. I was trying to cook dinner and even trying to be quiet with the pans and things, my mom was having a hard time hearing me. I can't find any way to adjust the sensitivity of the microphone.

As I mainly wanted these to listen to music while commuting and working out, it's not the end of the world. But it is a disappointment that something so expensive has this issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased the Jabra Elite 65T around 05 Jan and I have a Galaxy S9+, so here is my opinion based on scale 1=10:

(fit-9) they fit great straight out of the box. I had Bose which was not secure, however these really no issue.

(connectivity-1). The connection is my issue. Once you take them out of the case it automatically connects. 70% (do)-30%(dont). I notice the sound is off a bit, so either i verify with the app which shows if both buds are connected. Alot of the times one will not so I have to put both in the box and bring them out again. Running/walking-when using during work outs it constantly has a interruption sound (almost every 45 sec). I even had issues with it going out when the phone was in my left pocket. I moved it to my right and it minimized the connectivity interruptions. This happens when I run 5 miles or 2.

 Calls-I was able to walk maybe 10 feet away from my phone and the phone calls were sounding robotic. I even spoke with a Jabra customer agent and she says she noticed the robotic sound. I am in the process of trying her troubleshooting tips, and if it does not work I will send back.

(Music-6): Nothing special. The PowerBeats 3 were awesome for sound. Unlike the Jabra. They sound decent. They do have settings where you can make adjustments within the app. I have had them since like 5 JAN and this is the first time I have had to charge them. I used them off and on every day, but not really that long due to the connectivity issue.

For my final test, I had my wife use them with her Apple device and they worked fine. Music, calls,-worked fine. She walked upstairs around the corner, no issues...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_280?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=280&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-the left ear being completely dependent on right ear being active and can’t function on its own causes many annoyances, need cause on you at all times if you lose signal with left
-mic is horrible, it heavily picks up background sound rather than your voice, many calls I’ve had people can hear my environment but not me at all! I had to bring my right ear piece down to speak, but then the left ear loses sound due to auto detection feature which you can’t turn off

Their customer service is terrible. when you email them it takes days to respond and when they do respond it is the same standard reply.  Calling them is a joke.  No one ever picks up the phone.  When they work they are great when they do not buyer beware.

I left my ear buds at work to charge over night and when i got back to work the charge was the same as when I left. happens more than not. At first I thought that the charging case was not charged but then the next day I left the ear buds inside with the charging case plugged in to charge and same thing. Then I though that it cant charge because the charging case was not charged and cant be plugged in so I left the ear buds in the case with the case charged but not plugged in and same issue. Another thing is I am trying to use these at work so I want to be able to use one ear bud and not the other and be able to swap them out once one of them dies but these ear buds only work the left by itself and not the right one by itself. The right ear bud works by connecting to the left ear bud so you either have to use both ear buds or just the left one on its own. The app is amazing to use as it can tell you how much charge is left on the ear buds and you can edit the sound settings but its really inconvenient for me as I can only use the left one by itself. I am now planning to try out the apple air buds and am willing to lose sound quality for the ability to use either ear bud independently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And the design of the buttons is pretty poorly thought out, because to press down on them means pushing the earbud against your eardrum, which is very uncomfortable and even painful after 10-20mins wearing them. It would be much better to have the button on top or underneath, or be touch sensitive. Also, there was this buzzing sound in one of the earbuds which was annoying; I've heard this from others so it must be a quality control issue.

That said, the noise cancelling is better than competitors; it even sounded decent on the NY subway. But the discomfort they caused, and the buzzing fault, made these unwearable for more than 10mins.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are the best overall for me. I couldn’t deal with the size of Bose, even though the sound quality is better with better bass, they just look ridiculously large in my ears, and I have pretty big ears. I loved the convenience and build quality of the AirPods but they just don’t stay in my ears, even after using third party ear hooks to keep them in, they were still loose enough to not make a good seal and therefore sound quality, especially bass diminished compared to when I push them into my ears. The Jabras solve most of these problems, the fit is great and with three sizes of gel tips they should fit most people. Sizewise, they are mush smaller than the Bose, even smaller than I had hoped. They really don’t stick out much at all, and I’m happy with the color compared the white AirPods. Sound quality is decent, but not as good as the Bose. I’m knocking off half a star for somewhat anemic bass, though it is nice that this can be tweaked to a degree using the built in equalizer in the companion app. Also knocking off half a star for build quality, not that I’ve had any issues but they just feel a little “plasticy” compared to the two other brands. I live in an Apple world, so everything gets compared to their fit and finish and to be honest very little stacks up. That being said I don’t foresee any issues. The case is a decent size, not too big, but not as small as AirPods. Considering this I would like to see more than two full charges from the case, but so far battery life seems to be fantastic. Too early to tell, but so far I’m seeing less battery consumption on my commute than the AirPods (I didn’t keep the Bose long enough to judge). I’ve only made a couple of calls, but the first one I made, at the end of the call I asked the person on the other end how I sounded and they were shocked that I was using a headset. Can’t ask for any better than that. Pairing is super easy and I was happy to discover you can be connected to two devices at once, similar to Bose. I also have QC35,s and rally like this feature. Battery indicator shows on iOS lock screen for the buds but not the case, score one for AirPods. There is a small light on the case indicating charge level, score one for Jabra. I also like some of the features of the companion app, you can tweak the sound and save profiles for various environments, normal, commute, focus etc. Thers als o a cool feature I may not ever use where can just turn on ambient sounds, anything from white noise to nature (so far crashing waves is my favorite) to busy street sounds (not sure who this is for). In summary, if you’re looking for truly wireless earbuds with the best all around features give these a try. I got them on sale for 129.00 and feel like that’s a real bargain compared to the competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted the earbuds I saw on my computer monitor, in the color they were displayed: a nice white gold, pearly beauty. Instead I got this buttery, yellow gold pair of earbuds. Super disappointing since this is the only light color these are offered in.

The good part is that they are the best fitting earbuds I have ever owned and the sound is good. I heard some static noise during a couple of my songs, but I may have had the sound mixed wrong. I have to experiment further with the tuning.

There is good range and the hear through feature is pretty clever! I even took a desk phone call with them in.

It's a good alternative to the Apple earpods, which IMO are goofy looking and the type of design that never sat right in my ears.  Overall these should perform just fine in the gym, which is my primary reason I got them.

UPDATE: I ended up returning them. I couldn't stand the hearing aid look.

However there is one problem with my pair. Sound is uneven on left and right channel. Left earbud is louder then the right one. I guess this is the problem just with mine earbuds since nobody else mentioned it but still I have to give 2 stars for Jabra pure quality control. Ordering from Amazon in my country cost arm and leg so not sure if it even make sense to return these for replacement (if I have to pay for shipment expense again than it will cost almost as new pair of same earbuds).

UPDATE: I’ve just read reviews on amazon.co.uk. There are two verified buyer confirming same problem (uneven balance) and also crackling sound in loud environment in left (louder) earbud when pass through is enabled. Both buyer asked for replacement and in one case same problem was present again from beginning and in other case problem appeared after 5 days of use.

Jabra please stay on top of this. Headphones are great but this is clearly problem with production and QA that you need to resolve. Just asked for replacement so I am hoping to get working pair. Will update review once I get them but this is not good. Cases from amazon.co.uk  are suggesting there is possibility of wrongly put together beach of earbuds.

UPDATE 2: I've received replacement pair and it still has more or less same problem. Maybe it has something to do how sound is delivered to the ear canal that is different for some people.  I don't have same problem with any other earphones. Also problem with crackling sound in loud environment in left (louder) earbud when pass through is enabled, still persists.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_264?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=264&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While they worked great initially, one day the right ear started losing balance and would play at an almost inaudible level at maximum volume.  I thought it might be my ears, but I checked the other ear and it wasn't.

I tried to contact Jabra support about it and they did absolutely nothing.

Today the left ear started giving out and now they're basically unusable. While they sounded great initially, now it feels like I'm listening to a $1 speaker playing through a tin can at minimum volume for something I paid well over $100 for.

After a while my Buds died completely and i hadn't heard back from Jabra support so i ended up opening up the case (very easy to do from the inside as the piece where the buds sit on is rubber and can be pulled out. once i could see the internals the clip for the battery was very obvious and easy to get to, so with some tweezers I disconnected the battery from the board and reconnected it and all was well.

If you have nothing playing and pass through is enabled, you will hear a hiss because it is amplifying background ambient noise.  Just turn off the pass through if it annoys you.  I also like the fact that the earbuds pause playback when you take an earbud out.

I had no problem pairing them with my Galaxy S9+, and haven't had any dropouts and the range is better than 30 ft. No issues either with left and right earbuds not connecting.  I have paired it with my W10 laptop and Chromebook, but I found that if I'm connected to 2 devices at once, then the controls on the earbud don't seem to work predictably.

 The buttons are easy to get used to and I can easily pause playback, control volume, answer calls, etc.  I don't find it painful to press the buttons, unless one of the really long press actions.

The fit seems to be pretty good for me.  During my cardio workouts I sweat a lot and I haven't had any issues with them falling out.  The only time I had an issue was after I worked out and I was stretching and my head was basically sideways and the lower earbud felt very loose.

The case seems rugged and easy to use.  Earbuds drop right in and start charging.  I have dropped the earbuds while taking them out and they seem OK, but I worry about the plastic shell.

The app is pretty good, I like the equalizer.  I had to turn off notifications for the app though because it was annoying to have 2 non-urgent notifications displayed all the time.  I would like to have a little more control of the notifications that are displayed - i.e. only display an icon for things like low battery warning.

I use them every day. They stay in my ears, which is pretty rare. Do a decent job of cancelling out noise too. Customer service is prompt and helpful. I've only had one issue with the Hear Through feature and it turned out they just needed to be updated. Highly recommend!

The only con I can think of is the gold color is more of nude/beige. People never know when I am wearing them. But if you're going for stealth, get the gold.

Update: Had an issue with the hardware in the right pod. The sound was cutting out and only worked with pressure in an exact spot.

I use these headphones everyday since April 2019. They can seamlessly connect to my laptop and phone, and they stay in my ear very firmly. Great for working out and otherwise. I can leave my phone inside while doing yard work, and the connection stays strong. The batteries last almost exactly 5 hrs, so I try to take that into account when using them.

Negatives:
However, I do find the 'hear-through' function unpleasant. At first it is not noticeable, but as you use it there is an apparent 'white noise' which I find most annoying. I do not like the companion app because it seems very haphazardly put together imo.

Overall, I would recommend as long as with the above reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased a $39 off the wall brand of wireless earbuds because they were inexpensive, raved about how loud they were and had 4.75 stars with many reviews. They absolutely blow away the expensive Jabras. Jabra support appears to be helping but they seem to spend most of the time trying to figure out how it is you the consumers fault, I get it! But when there are numerous blogs out there with all of your faults, maybe more time needs to be spent fixing the issues and making the customer happy?

I purchased Apple Airpods and it's way better in terms of connectivity, sound quality and comfort. I wish I had done that before.

Very good sound and ability to dial it in but there is zero kick unless it's the only side of the EQ playing. The other side of the range steps all over it. (Still here?) Music does sound good and there is bass but it doesn't stand out. The biggest disappointment is right ear single use. All audio controls are on the left unit so you have to use your phone for vol/skip. I had planned on using just the right side for music and audio books with the phone tucked away. Don't care about phone features so I WILL be return these if support emails come back as no updates planned to allow features to switch sides. Shame really. Hearthrough feature is terrible. Far as I can tell all it does is add a white noise like effect with the mics as it needs to be at full volume to barely let those talking to you through the ear buds. These would have been perfect for me at work but if I have to use my phone to control sound and tracks this turn into really expensive earbuds with 75% of the features being useless single ear wise.

Base is fair for earpieces, even with the bass boost on the app, treble is good. Battery really does push 5-6 hours. Quick recharge. Light and comfortable. Only complaint is the included tips, which tend to get loose with basic activities for me. I recommend replacing with memory foam tips. Right earpiece can function alone, left only works if right is in as well. The HearThrough is an setting available on the app, to remove the noise cancelling feature. Don't advise this, there's a loud fuzzy background noise which is annoying. I've used them for about 4 days now and already prefer them to my LG's.

They aren't perfect, but they are, by far, the best ones I've tried, to date.

What I like:
For me, the fit is very good. The silicone earpieces seal my ear canal to allow good sound, including the bass that often gets lost with earbuds that don't fit well. The size is great. They are small enough to be unobtrusive, but can easily be grabbed to remove them. I like the controls. The right button (main control) is easy to find and depress, but not so sensitive that it gets activated by accident. I tried other brands of truly wireless buds that had a touch control that was way too sensitive. Every time I brushed up against something, it was turning on/off music or trying to activate Siri. Others I've tried had buttons that I had to push so hard it hurt my ear to do it. This one has a satisfying ""click"" that lets you know you pressed the button, but is still quite comfortable. The left side has volume up/down buttons that are also easy to find and depress. Battery life is pretty good for this type of device. I've been getting probably 3-4 hours of continuous run time. You can also keep it in standby mode, as you would a Bluetooth phone earpiece, but it will shut itself down after a time of inactivity (30 minutes, I think?).

The accompanying app allows you to fine tune the sound and also lets you set the ""hear through"" characteristics. I like that feature a lot. Most of the time when I have these in, I'm perfectly happy to tune out the rest of the world. There are other times, though, that I need to pay a little more attention, and the ability to allow a certain amount of the outside world in is great.

I am not a runner and I've not used them during intense workouts, but I feel like they have been very secure in my ears. I wouldn't expect them to stay in doing Matrix-like stunts. If you're looking to get them for workouts or running, Jabra has a ""sport"" model which is supposed to be more water resistant.

The cons:
Not a lot, here, but I will say that with extended wearing, they can get a little uncomfortable. This is not limited to these particular buds, however. I've rarely used in-the-ear buds that didn't get a little uncomfortable after having them in a while. That being said, they are much better than the majority I've tried. As you might expect, the little drivers in these earbuds are not going to compete with larger, on or over-the-ear headphones in volume or tone, but they are still very good.

All in all, I would certainly recommend giving them a try if you're inclined to go the ""truly wireless"" route. I've tried a lot of other brands (Bose, Jaybird, Beoplay, Bragi), and I've liked these the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The bluetooth connection was simple, both to my Alienware laptop (Windows 10) and to my iPhone X (ios 11). Putting the phones back in the case is a little awkward compared to the AirPods that I have. However the important stuff is the Jabra sound is much better, the isolation is much better and the ear fit is  superior. A slight tilt of my head and the AirPods would fall out; the Jabras stay in even with much greater tilts. Comfort of the Jabras is also better because I'm not having to poke them all the time to get them to stay in or to try to improve the sound. I use the largest size earphone tips on the Jabras for a good fit. The AirPods, of course, have no adjustment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I went on Jabra's website and learned of a firmware fix that was available and that unbalanced playback was a known issue. So I applied the update, which unfortunately didn't fix the issue at all.

My next step was to do a general search on the Internet and to my surprise this problem appears to be a common occurrence. Post after post of people applying the update, working with Jabra support, swapping headsets and finally returning the earbuds.

Would have been 5 stars if JABRA's consumer services fixed the issue, but the communication was lacking and downright unprofessional. In fact JABRA's consumer service was almost non existent, after a month of ignored emails, they finally responded with a PDF from the FAQ's page. And then radio silence, i still haven't heard back from JABRA after 6 weeks
Despite the earbud breaking, i liked the product and would have loved to give it 5 stars.... Although good customer service is a necessity in the online market, this company is lacking in that department to say the least.
Furthermore, JABRA did not honor the 2 year warranty.

A Painful Experience.","I worked out with them. Only had connection problems one time, and I was awaiting the update so I could use Alexa.
The sound quality is incredible. (I'm a studio musician)

Cons:
The charging case is REALLY difficult to open.
The material it is made from is not Great Dane proof.

Seriously, after owning these for 2 weeks, my big little buddy needed a snack, and he has expensive taste.
Not Jabra's fault. But it's ironic that I had a ton of trouble getting them out of the case: a task my idiot dog performed with the greatest of ease.

Final judgment:
If these were at a price point of $50, it would be a great buy.

But when something so expensive gets destroyed so easily, it hurts.
Painful Side note:
I replaced them with a pair of Skull Candy Bluetooth headphones for $25.

The sound quality is just as good, and the Great Dane is not interested in them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve tried resetting the headphones, re-installing the app. Nothing. I did some searching and this seems like a pretty common problem. Great headphones, good sound, but they are basically $200 earplugs without this functionality. Incredibly frustrating.

The Pros:
I use these to watch YouTube videos, stream music through Spotify, and just generally use my phone with them (OnePlus 6t)
There is no delay between what you see on the screen and what you hear, which is one of the biggest factors in whether I buy a product or not.
The sound is crisp and very detailed, and out of the box there's no pre-set adjustments (bass boost, high treble, etc) but the presets and equalizer in the app work wonderfully!
The hearthrough feature is definitely a factor in why I chose these over others, and once you get used to it it works (relatively) well! (More details under Cons)
They automatically pair when removed from the charging case and I've only had one issue where the left earbud didn't pair immediately but never encountered that again.

The Cons:
I would say the biggest issue I have with these is the hearthrough feature; for some reason the right earbud would seem to cut out all sound for a split second once or twice every few minutes. Imagine the opposite of hearing a clicking sound - it's like the tick tock of a clock but instead of hearing it, it's the absence of surrounding sound for a ""tick"" instead.
It's not noticeable when listening to music and using heathrough, but when using that feature standalone it's definitely annoying.
Also another con, the provided eargels do not fit my ears right, as the medium one that are already on the earbuds are too big for my ears and they hurt after a few minutes, and the small size ones that were provided we're too small and wouldn't stay in my ear. That's just my personal issue though and I'm sure very few people would have that problem so I did not include that in my review of this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The quick-start thing packaged in with the buds is next to useless for most problem-solving.  I'm a happy camper.

So far, connecting has been flawless, the range is quite good and the sound quality is better than expected -- once I spent time tweaking the mini graphic equalizer.  Minimal signal dropping, even 75-100 feet from the device.  Left bud not connecting?  Happened to me.  I tapped the bud once.  Problem solved.

Ear fit is still causing some issues, but it's early days and I haven't yet settled on an ideal size.  Consequently, a bud will fall out from time to time.  Tried the memory foam stuff but it fit no better than the silicon and doesn't work in the charging case.  But bud fit is my problem, not the device's, and I get multiple hours without discomfort even as I experiment.

Noise suppression is adequate.  Can't comment on mike or phone quality, since they aren't a major part of my usage.

It was between these Jabras and B&O.  Would have taken the latter, for the (presumed) better sound quality, but for the price difference -- it seems to me that this is emerging technology and eventually we will get a wireless bud that offers exceptional sound quality and incorporates a proper noise reduction technology.  That will make an upgrade worthwhile.

Meantime, I wouldn't hesitate to buy the Jabras again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_310?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=310&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Chunky shape pushes itself out of my ear canal with any facial expressions. None of the silicone tips fit well for me. Wish I could use the left side independently. When using the right side independently, can’t access the useful controls on the left side.
Sound quality is fine. I’m not using them for high quality listening, but for convenience. I don’t think they’re worth the high price tag. I expect fewer downsides when spending so much money on an item.

The earbuds and the case hold a nice charge.  I like that these can be set to automatically pause when removed from my ears. Don't put them into your pocket without the case or they will think they're still in your ears. They have the functions mentioned in their description.  Some things that aren't mentioned: The volume doesn't go very high.  If you want better than just marginally good sound you have to use your hands to keep them constantly pushed into your ears.  Occasionally, they won't connect to my phone forcing me to have to erase them from my Bluetooth menu and reinstall them.  The left earbud doesn't project bass.  I've used every fitting and the buds still fall out of my ears on a regular basis.  Definitely don't eat with these in your ears.  When I do they always work their way out.

The battery life of the earbuds is great, but the case can only recharge them 1.5 maybe 2 times before it is in the red, which does not bother me at all, but may bother others. The buttons are not real great. I can answer a call and pause/play very easily, but volume and skipping tracks requires pressing the PERFECT spot on the left ear bud, so for me, it is easier to just tap my phone's screen.

I have the Bose Soundport HR wireless earbuds and love them (sound/comfort), though they've started to fall apart after 2 years. After a bunch of research I landed on these guys and I'm very happy with my decision. A few things that stand out to me:

- The look. These earbuds are nice and small, unlike the Bose headphones that are a bit weird looking when wearing them due to their size.
- The noise cancelling. With the Bose headphones, my noise cancelling was just turning them up loud enough to drown everything else out. Probably not safe. These headphones not only create a good seal in my ear, they also have active noise cancelling and hear-through which is a really cool feature!
- The case. I love how small and convenient the case is. My earbuds charge very quickly and the case is a perfect way to keep track of them.
- The durability. As I mentioned above, my Bose earbuds have started to fall apart quite badly after 2 years. I've only had these for about a month, but given the higher water resistance rating the the materials (no soft plastic, like Bose) I suspect that they will hold up much longer (I would guess battery life will be my first issue to come up over time).

The only thing I give to Bose is their signature sound profile. I love bass in my songs and it's something that Bose always delivers on. That said, I've found that I can tweak my equalizer and get close enough to the sound I like that it's almost unnoticeable. With all of the other positives about these, this 'issue' really doesn't bother me anymore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Audio is good: I listen to all genres but mostly out on the street. The earbuds provide enough power to have loud but clear music. Balanced although a bit too much bass.
The material quality of the product is excellent. They fit perfectly in my ear.
The earbuds come with a nice box (which I ve already disposed :-)) and a rechargable station. The opening mechanism is a bit fiddle.
Charging is quick and the battery last long.
Bluethooth is actually a joke. In Manhattan, I have to carry the phone (Samsung S8 but I have tried it with 3 different phones, same result) in my right hand because carring it in my left hand or even in my pocktes would result in signal loss for a second or two!). In my appartment I have to be in close aproximity of the phone (I dont own a castle...).

Other attempts were usually met with the ""small"" ear canal adapters still feeling too large, but with the 65t I find that I'm using the ""medium"" covers with great comfort!  Note that ""Out of the box"" sound  I found was not very good and I had to do something that I normally would never recommend; I loaded up the android app and after turning all EQ settings to MAX, I feel I achieved a better FLAT response with more ability to have extra volume headroom.  I have the Pixel XL, so you may have a different result, but certainly give it a try if you find the sound ""tinny"".  Will this perhaps impact battery life? Perhaps, but with plenty to start with I doubt I'll notice.  Meanwhile, People on the other end of my phone calls have complemented me for the new clarity as they often complained about my prior around the neck LG solution.  Throw in Alexa & Google Home abilities I have found very little to not like.  The volume ""up"" & ""down"" button positions are a bit awkward in my opinion.  That is a very small complaint.

The first pair stopped working after 1 week of gym use. These were amazing until it stopped. The right earbud just went dead. None of the reset methods could get it working and searching for answers online revealed this is a known problem.

I exchanged it through amazon and the second pair worked as expected, but about 30 minutes into my workout, the right earbud fell out of my ear. When picking it up, I realized the rubber tip was missing. From my picture, you can see the tip ripped at the base and the tip had actually stayed in my ear canal! It was a major scare when I get pinch it with my finger tips and had to ask the gym staff to let me use their first aid tweezers.

These will just drop out of the ear with no warning, you won't feel it then bam, it falls out! And the worst part. When I return the ear peice back into the charge case they stay connected to the phone. This is a real problem, the only way to get it to disconnect is to turn my bluetooth off... but then my watch is not connected to my phone. So the only option is not bring my earphones with me!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_312?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=312&reviewerType=all_reviews"

HOWEVER, I don't ever even bother to use these headphones anymore due to the fact that, even with your volume all the way up, whatever media you're trying to play through the headphones never gets loud enough. With any other headphones that I've used, I normally never play things at full volume, but with these you have to - and even then its not loud enough. I would have given the Jabra Elite's a higher rating for the app (with all of its great features) and the long-lasting battery life of the headphones, but because of how quietly sound is played through the headphones I don't even use these anymore - which to me indicates that buying these was a giant waste of money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was looking for wireless earbuds to listen to music while I work out.  I was using wired but kept yanking them out of my ears as I exercised on an elliptical. The sound quality is excellent, most of the time.  At other times it can be crackly at which point you have to put them back in the case and put them back in your ears to clear it up.  It will also get crackly if you walk too far away from the source.

As far as noise cancellation I would say it is OK.  The plug into your ears fairly well which alone is enough to cancel out most of the noise.  Then when you are playing music it takes away most of the rest. However, at my gym there is a room they have exercise classes in.  They play the music EXTREMELY loud.  Even with the doors closed you can hear it.  The earbuds block much of that noise but not all of it.  I can still hear the music.

Overall, would I buy them again?  Probably but I would check to see what else is out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Airpods work great but don't stay in my ears and don't provide the isolation that I want on the train.  I quickly ran into two problems with these buds.  First, they don't seal the ear very well.  In train with a lot of base noise the sound still gets in.  The second problem was fatal for me.  On the platform and often on the train I would suddenly get stuttering or sound drops.  This never happened with the Airpods.  As a result I took these back.  After some further thought I decided to give the Beoplay E8 a try since it uses BT4.2 and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only do they sound great and insulate better but on my train ride to work this morning not a single sound drop or stutter.  I have an Iphone 8.

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player I cant give this more than 2 stars because at this price point they should be more reliable than a pair being sold for 1/3rd the price. That being said, the sound quality is very good, they fit in my ear extremely well and could shake my head with them not falling out. If you have small ears however they uncomfortably fit in my wifes ears.

But I gave it two stars because I assumed these would be working ready to go when I got them so I ordered them a week before my deployment. When I got them the left ear bud wasnt working, messed around with it putting it in the case and taking it out several times and finally worked, chalked it up to I wasnt putting it in the case correctly. Leave for my deployment, took me 30 mins to get the earbud working messing with it on the flight. Now everytime I want to use it, it takes anywhere for 5 mins to 30 mins to get it to work. When I get to my location will stick to a pair that's rated higher on Amazon. Extremely disappointed that a 160$ pair of earbud work less than a 50 dollar pair I purchased before this purchase. Wish it was working all the time because the sound quality was good.

Update: left ear still intermittent, I found a way to turn it on but, most of the time does not want to charge as you can see in the video. The right one works perfect, recognizing being pulled out and recognizes being placed in to charge.

25 Sep update: left ear bud sounds completely dead. Changes songs fine, volume up and down works. But the speaker is already dead.

I can't believe the stellar reviews these Jabras are getting from numerous sources with only a few reviews on YouTube picking up that the audio sound experience is not that great.
Note also:
- the Jabra 'app' equaliser settings cannot be 'manually changed' like with Jaybird App, there are just a few 'default settings' which truth be told don't change the sound that much;
- all the above competitor products are much louder/actually think sound quality is better;
- and the case, whilst conveniently small, doesn't 'click in' nicely the earbud parts like the Apple Airpods.

I recently returned my Bose Sound Sport Frees because they didn't have enough passive noise isolation. The BSSF are excellent in sound quality but you cant enjoy the sound unless you are in a completely quiet place or blast your eardrums. I decided to give the Elite 65t since it seemed to have good reviews. Got them and was very impressed in the compact size and the noise isolation compared to BSSF. The passive noise isolation great. Then I found that the left bud produces white noise a split second before, during and a second after sound plays. The only thing that can cover the white noise is music with loud percussion. Other than that, like with podcasts and classical music, it comes through and is very annoying. It is the noise that you would hear from a super cheap headset. It has nothing to do with the ""Hear-through"" feature. The white noise isn't there when the HT is on or off, only when playing something. I have another Bluetooth headset that doesn't make the noise at all.

I'm attempting to return these so I can purchase another set and give them another try since I'm assuming that this is not normal for an almost $200 dollar earbud. Now Amazon says that I have to pay for shipping to return this defective item. I messaged the seller saying that it is not right that I have to pay to ship back a defective item. I'm waiting to hear back from them. I'd love to love these especially since the completely wireless feature is very helpful in my line of work. I'm hoping to hear back from them and get a new set to give these another try.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_397?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=397&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have not experienced any of the issues that I saw in other reviews.
1) When both earbuds are in, the sound is clean (music, podcasts and phone calls) and background noise is completely blocked out. I can't hear someone talking to me when they are standing next to me.
2) the right earpiece will work without the left, but the left does not work without the right.  I have noticed on occasion if the left is out for ""a while"" it doesn't reconnect when I put it back in my ear. However, just redock in the charger and it resets. But this is only after I have had it out for several minutes.
3) No issues with battery life... I use every day for a couple hours at a time and charge the base about once a week.
4) wearing at the gym is great... I haven't had issues with them falling out (comes with extra sizes) or getting sweaty and interfering with the sound.

Noise cancellation is not perfect. The hear through feature is clearly noticeable, but some noise still gets through.
The mic is not good at all, for calls. People on the other end cannot hear properly.
The connectivity has an issue when placing the phone in pocket. I use Oppo F7. The connection is interrupted when the camera end of the phone is lower in the trouser pockets.

1.  I could get past this, but what's with not using magnets to help them click into place in the case,  magnets are cool, everyone loves magnets with the satisfying click.  just a missed opportunity.
2.  most importantly they fill up your earlobe and it turns out my ear lobes don't fit magically to the shape of the device like I assume only a small percentage of users do.  At least put some rubber or foam to make it more comfortable,  I can't ware these for more than 2 hours without it hurting which really helps save the battery btw.
3. It's cool the way this thing connects to all your devices at the same time but it is a mistake.  I'll be watching something on my laptop and then I open my phone and the laptop audio cuts out because the jabra is listening to both devices now and it has to catch up.  So I have to turn off the phone bluetooth for the laptop audio to come back.

They sound just ok and have no base even with base boost on.  I find the buds that came with my phone sound better.  The biggest problem for me is the static and skipping, they used to skip CONSTANTLY during activities but I found out it was the auto pause that was the problem as they would stop when they are not seated in your ear hard enough.  That leads me to my next problem, for ""active"" ear buds they fall out of your ears A LOT!  I tried all 3 tips and the medium are best for me but still not great.  I find myself pushing them back in every 30-60 seconds while running which is super annoying.  The addition of wings or clips would completely alleviate the problem and for so much money they should be included.  While shooting around I found the jostling of stopping and picking up the ball made them fall out even faster...just unacceptable.
The static problems are real also, I tried everything in all of the FAQs and the static is greatly reduced but still there.  The passthrough option brutally increases static so it's a useless feature IMO unless you can tolerate static.

TLDR - I'm returning these because they are just not any good...sound bad, no base, static always, low range and fall out constantly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Check first to make sure they fit.","Here is my straightforward opinion and experience with these. I will cover what I consider the negatives- unless you always wear both earbuds the volume control is a mystery. Because I use mine mostly for telephone use, I normally only wear one in my right ear. I have tried every size ear piece and purchased additional ones and none of them have resulted in a snug fit and reduced noise. Yes there are other adjustments for noise cancellation and they do help but marginally at best. So between these falling out of my ear on a regular basis plus some other small nuances that seem to pop up I probably wouldn’t buy them again.

Now the pro’s:  I love how small they are and not having a cord. I have always had some type of tether on my past ones and as expected the cord was a pain. These are a joy in comparison. Whenever I wear both which is not often, the sound is excellent and crisp. Not a huge amount of thump but I’m ok with that.in summary of the fit my ear better I would have no issues, however, because of the fit I will be looking at other options soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can't swap out for different tips either due to size","Been on a quest to find a substitution for the Apple EarPods (EarPods hurt after a short time) and REALLY wanted to love the
Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds. Since I am only giving 2 stars, I won't list all of the obvious pros (for ex: 5 hours battery, the convenience of wireless headphones, cool app with equalizer adjustment feature)

Instead, I will explain the two main reasons these are being returned:

A. For $181.89 (order total with tax) I wasn't blown away by the sound quality. Even with the ability to adjust/customize within the app these just didn't sound like the EarPods. I understand that that's a tall order but I am thinking that for this price, the sound should've come alot closer than it did.

B. Due to the shortness of the rubber tips, they repeatedly fell out of my ears unless I did the twist to get them to suction in super tight. Presumably because the earbuds are so ""top heavy,"" within around 45 min or so, my ears were aching. It was the slightest dullest ache but it was still frustrating. Actually, I was in the grocery store and tried to adjust them ever so slightly just to make one one of them suction more/less tight and within a few seconds it had fallen on the ground and I almost lost it under the cash register. When I got home I tried to swap out the tips for different rubber tips that never hurt my ears (the cheapies from my ""wired"" pair) - see pics... but the different sized plastic piece didn't allow for it. Very bummed that these weren't ""the ones"". I realize that this is because my ears are just sensitive (must be the shape of the cartilage) but I just find it odd that I can wear the other shaped headphone earbud tips for 6+ hours and never even really notice they are there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_398?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=398&reviewerType=all_reviews"

AirPods, Indy’s, Anker’s, Jaybird’s, and even some just cheap (well rated) brands off Amazon. Personally, the Jabra Elite 65t just killed it in every category.  AirPods are a good product, the friendly controls were amazing.  In the end, I wanted noise canceling & more bass, throw in a case, to class I race.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_349?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=349&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I decided on these on advice from an actual Jabra employee at a telecom trade show because he explicitly told me the MIC was noise cancelling as well as the speakers. I was skeptical because this is unheard of in wireless bluetooth earbuds, so I asked and asked and was confidently reassured... COMPLETE MADE UP BS!!!

NOICE CANCELLING MIC (OR LACK THEREOF) :
The first call I made, there was someone talking a couple rooms down at normal volume, and the person I was speaking too could hear every word they said almost better than I could.. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!

They LITERALLY ENHANCE background noice, NOT REDUCE!! I am really not exaggerating here!! RIDICULOUS!!

FALSE ADVERTISING ON DIGITAL ASSISTANTS:
Advertised Siri, Alexa and Google assistance, however when setting up, Only Siri and Alexa where available!! BS!!

HORRIBLE CASE:
Cover for case is crap, hard to open, flimsy plastic hinge, honestly it reminds me of a pack of gum fro the dollar store! When you (force) open the lid, the earbuds are just loose sitting there, some sometimes flick out or at least bounce around!

When putting them back in, they do not sit well, seems like because the charging terminals are big pointy springs which pushes them up and makes them wiggly. While in, you can't tilt or turn upside down it they just fall out, especially compared to AirPods which never inadvertently fall out no matter what!

Also the case shows a lot of greasy finger prints, even though my hands were clean and certainly was not after handling anything greasy or dirty at all!

MULTIPLE DEVICE SUPPORT:
They are suppose to pair to 8 devices, and connect to 2 at once.. Again BS!! While I can technically connect my MacBook and iPhone at the same time, while both are connected, I CANNOT play music on my iPhone!! I plays for 1 second and pauses EVERY TIME without fail, no way around it.

Also when connected to 2 devices, put in the case and take out again, it doesn't reestablish the connection!! How dumb!!

SOUND QUALITY:
Sound quality is average at best, certainly not close to AirPods, or LG Tones with the HK speakers.. Very tinny and flat, even with the large silicon tips and equalizer settings. They are technically slightly louder than AirPods, but fuzzy and horrible at that louder volume, disgusting!

COMPUTER SUPPORT:
When paired to MacBook, I installed the Jabra app, and it detects it, can see battery life, but there is not ONE SETTING IN THERE that matches any of the settings in the mobile app, which is where you turn on noise cancelling for the speakers, change profiles, equalizer, etc... ALL MISSING form the MacBook, making them just another set of bluetooth earbuds, with none of the advertised features!!

CONCLUSION:
I have to eat my words (and hate) for my AirPods, which at the moment is the lesser of the evils, but does renew my appreciation for those things, Makes me rethink my Apple hate!

These really are $30-$40 generic bluetooth earbuds, which do not work as advertised in almost any way!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Both times I wore them running one earbud fell out. I lost it the second time and support wouldn't even replace it. Billed for using while active but can't even stay in my ears!

Uncomfortable after a couple hours of use. Biggest drawback is the reception. I usually keep my phone in my pocket with the top pointed toward the ground. At that distance, I get music skipping and drops. When I bought these, I was under the impression I'd be able to walk to the next room and leave my phone without any impact on reception, but the effective range of consistent signal is just a few feet.

I've never been a fan of the flexible rubber ear tips, I've always preferred the squishy foam ones (like on my Koss wired earbuds). My only reason for getting these is to wear to the gym, so my main concerns were fit and being sweatproof. I don't care about the battery life (only use them for about an hour at a time), or much about the sound quality (I usually blast some AC/DC to drown out the pop/dance crap at the gym). I sweat a lot. I mean really a lot, so I need the sweatproof feature. So far so good with that, it hasn't been an issue during workouts, and I dry them off before I put them back in the case. And yes, the case is surprisingly hard to open. The main negative is that at least one of the buds has fallen out of my ears at least once per workout. I've managed to catch it each time, because I can feel it starting to come loose. It will be really bad news if one falls out and gets stepped on or something. Maybe it's just those hateful rubber tips (I've tried all 3 sizes), so I'll probably be buying a 3rd party set of foam tips to see if that helps. I do powerlifting at the gym, so it's not a high impact bouncing kind of effort that makes them fall out. I think they'd be even worse if I was running or doing crossfit. If you're used to these kinds of tips and are happy with them, you might have better luck. The controls are easier to use than expected, though I've only been able to get the ""double-press"" to activate the ""hear-through"" function to work a couple times. They're much smaller than I expected, and they're barely visible from a head-on view (according to people who try to talk to me and can't even tell that I'm wearing them). Also quite expensive, probably makes sense to try a cheap pair first to see if you like the general fit and feel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-65t-Earbuds-Engineered/product-reviews/B077ZGRVRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"
