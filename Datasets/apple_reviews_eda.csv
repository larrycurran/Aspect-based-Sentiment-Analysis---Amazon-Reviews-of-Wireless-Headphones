battery life dies really quick,"i really like my airpods but the battery life for me is an issue. my airpods don’t even last half the day. When i charge my airpods to 100% and i use my airpods for an hour, it’s already up to 50%. My brother bought his airpods from the apple store and when he charges it up to 100%, it’s lasts for 3 whole days without dying ( he uses it for at least 3 hours each day). Overall besides the battery life being really short, the sound quality is good.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Works when they work but so many glitches,These work well enough but the whole reason I bought them was not wanting to shove my phone in my waist and to walk ten steps away while listening and the range on them really stinks. I have plenty of blue tooth devices and I’m aware they aren’t meant to range a million miles away or anything but wandering into the next room & having them go out is really annoying! Also they won’t connect with my Apple Watch another reason for purchase to cut the phone out of the equation with audibles download to watch with wireless headphones feature.  I feel like they’re really glitchy too - randomly refusing to play when tapped and skipping forward when I try to tap to play. Finally the mic is iffy - I’ve had way too many people going “what what what I can’t head you” while talking with them who hear totally fine if I switch to my cars Bluetooth or my cell speaker. When they work they work and the charging case is neat but lots of issues in my opinion too.,3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Not for me.,"To be honest I knew I would not like these before purchasing but I wanted to try something different (been using Beats X wireless since 2017) the wire makes them not so wireless. But anyway, so I decided to give them a try because they were on sale. Here is my issue with the AirPods and every other Apple headphone made....they hurt my ears. No seriously if I have these things in for more than 10 minutes, they hurt. Why not make something softer?",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Very frustrating to connect,Why do these cost so much when they literally take upwards of 10 minutes to connect sometimes. Like they will literally not connect more than half of the time I use them. I have tried connecting and disconnecting several times before and they literally take 10-20 minutes of trying to connect. Wtf. Apple is too profitable to have such problematic features in their products,2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Surprisingly superior,"Bought as gift.  Wife had complained about most ear insert 'ear-buds'.  These hit the spot!  Best feature is they're cordless.  She forgets she's wearing them.  Worth the extra cost.  However, you don't need wireless charging model.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I use them for international and local US conf calls ALL day long and they are great!  While I do forget they are in , after a long time in my ears, my ears get annoyed/sore. I have small ears ...so I would like if there was a small version or cushion.

Used product,"Quick delivery. Package was in good shape but the AirPods case had some little specks on it. Was expecting to see a clean white surface since it was wrapped in a plastic adhesive, but I had to scrape the specks with my fingernail.

When I opened the AirPods case there was dark residue in the cap and surface of where the pods sat in. The earpieces of the pods had crusty earwax on it. I spent a good 10 minutes with sanitize wipes cleaning the whole thing.

The product works fine but I just wish it didn't have another person's earwax on it.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Just give me my proper headphone jack back.,"If you still have a headphone jack in your phone, don't buy these. After buying several dysfunctional dongles with headphone jacks (both official apple brand and off brand) and off brand wireless earbuds worth over $100 combined I gave in and bought these. In general these are better than most wireless earbuds, and its better to just buy these despite the price. They are about as comfortable to wear, and they have about the same level sound quality as my $10 gummy earbuds (Gummy earbuds have good quality and last a while so I'm not saying the quality is bad, just that these are insanely overpriced). They have some convenient functions but they are not worth $150 if you can avoid it. I enjoy being able to listen to music and podcasts privately so for the sake of continuing that source of pleasure I was forced to buy these. They don't always instantly connect to your phone which is slightly inconvenient but an easy fix, and the tap to pause function only sometimes works, so I could either tap it twice and it instantly pause perfectly like its supposed to or it could fail to pause after a dozen attempts. My next phone purchase might just be going backwards to the last iphone with a headphone jack just so I can listen to my music hassle free. That or finally abandon apple after all these years and find a good brand with a headphone jack.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
NOT THE LATEST MODEL - Disgusting product. Spend your money somewhere else!,"THIS IS NOT THE LATEST MODEL. DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT AIRPODS 2. Also, mine did not work. They never paired and I feel like Amazon is scamming people by selling these as if they were in fact the latest model.

Edit: The second pair just came in and they are absolutely disgusting. If anyone at Amazon looked at these and thought it was okay to ship the product in this condition, I would be surprised. Please look at the pictures I attached. I have never been so displeased at a product/company. There's earwax on the headphones, dust and dirt all over the insides, and so on. I reiterate - do NOT buy this product.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Easy easy to use. Great sound quality. Great calling experience.,Bought the cheaper off-brand knockoffs first. Spent $30. Ish. I couldn’t read the directions as the print was minuscule and in light-gray typeface. They weren’t on google so never knew how to work them sent them back-decided to suck it up and throw down the cash for these (plus they were discounted $15) and am glad I did. Synced w my iPhone 6S like a breeze. Easy to use. Tips all over the internet. No complaints from callers. I just irk Downtown where it’s loud and noisy on the street. Not a prob.

Perfect PERFECT performance and fit.,"Good sound, though I’m 63 and not an audiophile.  But you can’t beat them for convenience.  Great for walking due to Siri based controls.  Siri also let’s me look unfamiliar words while listening to audiobooks, which I love.  Only earbuds I’ve ever found that stay in my ears, yet so light and comfortable that I forget I have them in.  Not exactly a fashion statement in my opinion.  I joke that, with the white protuberances going down out of the years of an older guy, it looks like his hearing aids are melting.

LOVE - But recharge twice a day.,"Oh my gosh there was a short sale and my Hubby got these for me for Mother's Day and I could not be happier!!!!

Pros:
* NO WIRES (until you need to charge the case itself)
* These are the only in-ear headphones I can use, everything else gives me headaches after a short while.
* They fit snug and very rarely fall out.
* Charges last half a day of continuous listening to music
* Sound clarity is very good!  Callers can hear me better than from my phone by itself because of the case, and much better than my car's mic.
* Recharging is very short, less than 15 minutes to fully charge inside it's case - less than an hour and the case is good to recharge the ear pieces for a 2 day period without a wall socket.
* Lightweight

Cons:
* White shows EVERYTHING!  Every spec of dust, every fragment of ear wax will show up from space!
* The charge on the ear pieces only seems to last 5-6 hours at most, maybe only 4 with non-stop listening at a higher volume
* Sometimes the ear pieces lose battery and die even while not connected to anything, if not in their case.
* Sometimes one earbud seems to lose charge before the other and I still am not sure why?  Stereo sound?
* These do not cancel sound very well - I don't believe that is part of the design anyway, but worth mentioning that if you are trying to drown out noisy, gossiping co-workers, airplane humming, or highway tire rumbling, you'll want OVER EAR headphones.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I didn't do anything out of the norm with them to drain the battery. If this is the way all of them are, I would not recommend getting these to anyone.

"Convenience and ease of use is amazing, fit and sound is EH","Pros:
- I carry them everywhere in my jean's pocket because they are so small
- They ""just work""  no lag or trying to get them to pair to bluetooth, they always connect and work

Neutral:
- Battery life is good for how small the buds are, but the case is great in that it has extra charge capability

Cons:
- I can only wear them for 45mins tops before my ears start to hurt. Very uncomfortable any longer than that
- Sounds quality has a lot to be desired. I cant tell if they are just bad or that the Beats PowerBeats Pro are amazing.

Overall:
You cant win.  If you want longer lasting, more comfortable, amazing sound wireless buds, you need to get the PowerBeats Pro.  But if you get those, you will NEVER bring them with you because the case is HUGE.  I ended up buying both these airpods and Powerbeats Pro and couldnt be happier.

Though I dislike the fit and sound, these are still 4 stars because for basic podcasts, quick music at the work desk, calls, and of course how small they are, it more than offsets the cons.  But trust me, there is no way these could ever be rated 5 stars.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Not working,My left AirPod stopped working a minute into using it. Can I get this order replaced?,1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Meh,"Not as great as I hoped they'd be.
Upon buying them, you'll have three more things to keep charged all the time.
Supporting software makes it difficult to know precisely how much charge is in either of the three devices (two air pods -- and the charging case).

You'll also be constantly worried about losing them. When you do, Apple will make you pay for the replacement... not cheap, either.

It's hard to wear them for a long period of time -- they start to hurt your ears after a while, as they are only made of hard plastic.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Consistency & Ease of Use are the best with Airpods..like it or not.,"I'm not honestly a fan of Apple & the way they force some of their ideas on us, but in some cases, they're just unbeatable. When you compare AirPods to every other product out there, nothing is easier to pair, works better or longer and more consistently than these. I don't care about wireless charging myself, but having Bluetooth 5.0 is a worthwhile improvement over the 1st gen for both range and power usage.

Definitely More Thump,I have version 1 and 2. This one definitely has more base and for me is worth it for that alone not to mention you can tell Siri to turn up the volume or change tracks all in one command without waiting for her to answer. Siri even works speaking softly while you are listening st full volume.  I found the wired EarPods are a little louder and have more base than the 1st version AirPods but the second version AirPods beats them both. It may have something to do with the base port being larger.  They sound great.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Wow,"This thing performs well in all of the standard headphone categories like:
- great sound quality
- stays in ears (at least mine - i'm a normal sized guy, 5'10"" 190lbs)
- great battery life
- fast charging
- great noise cancelling
- works amazing as a 2-way (i use it for conference calls while walking down busy streets and airports all the time and rarely get people saying that background noise is distracting)

Where this thing blows away all competition is just the magic of how effortlessly it works.  Open the case lid and your phone asks you if you want to set up your new AirPods.  Once it's set up, pop them in your ear and whatever you were playing on the phone goes to your AirPods.  Then pop them out and whatever you were listening to automatically pauses.  You get helpful little sounds when the battery starts running down.  To charge them, just pop them back into their case (which itself stores probably 4 or 5 full charges for the headphones) and they'll be workable again in about a minute, and fully charged in about 10 minutes.  (I haven't actually timed this, that's just anecdotal)

I get that there are much cheaper wireless headphones out there but anyone who has ever used AirPods can tell you these are another level of convenience and quality.  Once you use these you'll never go back to non-Apple products, at least not for use with an iPhone.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Authentic and Beautiful, Love these way more than ever expected","These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.
Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time.

Better than other wireless buds...,"I have had wireless earbuds for two or three years, but the battery recently quit accepting a charge, so I had to dump them...they cost about 50% more than these when I bought them, but the AirPods sound better and are just a nicer package all around...sorta typical Apple...a feeling of quality.  They pair with my iPhone like a dream.  My biggest concern about the Apple design was whether they would stay in my ears while doing daily walks.  They stay just fine...however, more strenuous exercise might require the accessory rubber-ish covers which hold them in much tighter (I'm told).  But I'm 75 so walking is as strenuous as it gets for me.  I am enjoying this purchase immensely and at a fraction of the cost of my former wireless buds it's really a good deal...and they sound very balanced.  No complaints.

Very satisfied,"These bevies are the right thing to do. I have tried so many other and wasted my money. The noise cancellation when worn with the mike down is not as strong as when worn upside down. Try them, it is a new experience. I wore my wired pods upside down for the same reason, they seal your ear canal to the outside noise and don’t hurt your ears. Of course every one is anatomically different, but it is my experience. Great product. A little expensive in price, but worth every penny. The sound is amazing, they did not look like they have the quality of sound, but they do.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Don't buy it,"The air pods may seem really cool and popular but it is in it's name ""air"" how is something supposed to stay in your ear if it't always in the air imagine skydiving, the air pod is going to fall out and float in the air like it always does, I mean who would buy this like half the time I would smack my friend on the side of the head thinking a bug was going to crawl into his ear and kill him, he then hits me back and says ""You idiot, for the 20th time it my Air-pod""

Clearly air pods are just another way for apple to make millions. First their crappy chargers that you had to buy over and over, now these things called air pods which makes everyone who wears them act cool. When really they are being brain washed my the aliens up above making them buy more apple products. One day all air pods will float off into the air and everyone but me will be sad they wasted so much money on a produced to fly away.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Same AirPods 2, better price.","Update: My left AirPod stopped working after only two months. I owned the AirPods 1 for over two years without a problem. I don’t know if Amazon got a bad batch of these but many others have experienced the same problem. Now it is too late for me to return them and I have to go through a service repair system that’s in adequate and can take a couple weeks to repair. What a headache right after you can no longer get a refund. This is beyond frustrating!

This is my second pair of AirPods. I had AirPods 1 for 2½ years and the battery wouldn’t last past an hour before they needed to be charged again. I came across these when they were on back order and had special pricing of $139. I couldn’t pass that deal up. It took almost a month for them to arrive (well maybe three weeks). But it was well worth it. I read reviews where some customers said these weren’t the real AirPods or weren’t the AirPods 2. I looked mines up via the serial number. They are the AirPods 2, they work fine and sound great. I saved $40 plus the extra tax. Then I sold my old AirPods 1 for $40. It’s like I got the new AirPods 2 for $100. Amazon has great deals and honor their return policy so you can’t go wrong with this purchase. Happy Birthday to me!",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

It’s alright I guess,The air pod are nice. They are easy to put on and they don’t fall out (perfect for working out). If you turn it all the way up they you won’t hear anyone but beside that it’s has the same noise canceling as the typical head phone you get from apple. Also I have hard time connection it to my windows computer. Heads up,3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
"I wanted to dislike these, but I can't.","I didn't buy these from Amazon, but I use the listing for price matching, and know that my item is authentic.
With that said, I think that the AirPods were some of Apple's best engineering work last year, and Gen 2 is the best yet.
They connect to my iPhone XR instantly. I don't always see the charge status notification, but there has never been a delay in getting them to work. In use, I notice almost no lag, and I have never encountered dropped audio. They play nicely with my Apple Watch and my Lenovo Windows laptop as well.
If you like your music loud, you won't like these; they have virtually no noise-cancelling and cannot get very loud. That said, sound is clear and high-fidelity.
Battery life is excellent, especially for a product so small. I have had no trouble getting the 24 hours combined usage Apple suggested between charges, but I tend not to use my AirPods more than 2 hours per day. Using the ubiquitous Apple 5W 'iPhone' power adapter and the included Lightning cable, I get from maybe 10% on all devices to 100% in about 90 minutes of charging.
With my usage, I end up needing to charge maybe once every week or two.
I skipped on the Wireless Charging case because AirPower never reached production and I have my Qi charger set up just to make sure I don't fall asleep without charging my phone. The case is great, nonetheless. If you're clumsy like me, consider getting a case like the one in my picture.
Honestly, I don't really like Apple products. For a time, I thought that included this product. One of the things I dislike most about this one is the fact that the batteries aren't replaceable, for all intents and purposes. Like I mentioned, audio quality isn't great, but it's good, and these AirPods are really good for making calls and dictation, however, and I will likely keep using them for that.
That said, the fact that I'm writing such a positive review about these should indicate my satisfaction with it. And I would buy them again.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Then when the volume is up they block out the ambient sound.  The fit also is more comfortable than the ""in-ear"" earbuds.

Should have worked out the bugs prior to releasing,"I will start by saying I never owned the 1st generation AirPods. I bought my 2nd Gen pair in April 2019. During the first month and a half, both the left and right AirPods (at different times) ended up becoming extremely muffled and Apple had to replace both (for free because of the one-year warranty). Eventually, they ended up swapping out the entire set for a new one, including a new charging case. Even the new one had issues with the right pod being muffled. When I took it into the Apple Store, the rep said that this was a known issues with the AirPods and that the only fix right now is swapping them out for new ones. She also speculated that Apple was so hasty to release a new version that came in different colors, etc. that they did not properly take the time to test for such bugs. I would opt for a 1st generation pair until the 2nd gen bugs get worked out. The minimal new features are not worth the potential hassle of technical issues.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Most solid Bluetooth connection you’ll find,"I originally never thought I’d own these..  I have several Apple products and try to buy other brands just so I don’t come across an an Apple fanatic (I'm actually somewhat critical of them)..  I also always want to know if the grass is greener, I want to own the best gadgets regardless of who makes them :)  I own Bose Soundsport free and a couple pairs of Zolo liberty plus.  I also have used an Anker set with the wire between the buds.
The AirPods, while I have experienced bugs over the years..  they are the most robust Bluetooth connection I’ve used.  They literally NEVER cut out when using under normal conditions.  I bought the first generation ones because I like that they are small and white, fits perfectly under a hair net that I have to wear in clean rooms for work.  Can listen to my tunes and most people won’t even notice I’m wearing em.  I have put dozens of yards of space between me and my phone, several tall metal machines that one would think should interfere with the connection.  It amazes me how solid they are.
Now, I won’t use these for working out as I sweat quite a bit and I’m certain they’ll fall right out.  I think the Bose ones are the most secure for working out.
Battery life is pretty good when they are new.  After a year or two you will notice that it declines (based on my experience with the gen1 version).  The battery case could definitely have more juice.  When compared to the amount of charges you can get with the Zolo’s, puts the AirPods and the Bose to shame.
People like to complain about the sound quality and sometimes about the lack of noise cancellation.  But I find that they sound really good, granted I’m not really a sound snob..  easy to please..  IMO neither the Bose or the Zolo sound any better.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

The technology in the small package is just mind blowing. I run/exercise every morning and work from home so I can use these in every aspect of my daily lift and they never seem to run out of juice! Some have stated sound quality is not up to ""X"" product but seriously?! Considering what features are packaged into these little pods I would argue they are better than anything you compare against them and they do it at a fraction of the cost! Audiophiles might stick their nose in the air but these things deliver great sound! You can compare them to a litany of Bluetooth wireless headphones which may be better in a certain aspect, but all of the other options give up features that these contain. My one complaint/recommendation for those that are worried about fitment or rigorous movement is to snag some of the Earbuddyz skins.

The Charging Case is Green until you put the Right Pod into charge, and then it goes Orange. And if I check my iPhone for charge status, it shows the Right Pod as not charging unless I plug the Charging Case in, so the whole point of the Charging Case is a joke.

Waste of Money!,This is a waste of money! After having the AirPods for 1 week the left side decided to stop working.

Seamless connection and great fit,"Shocked that these fit as the free plug ins that apple provides never fit me. My ears are on the small side; I usually use the smallest plugs. These are not what I’d call secure but good enough. If I am going in walks (or working out) I suggest getting those clips that fit on the ends do that you don’t lose these as it does not take much movement to fall out. For seating or lying it is not a big issue. Seamless Bluetooth connection to the phone and can work easily with multiple devices. When switching just go to settings/bluetooth and hit connect if switching devices from the one last used. Could greatly improve the battery life, that being said they recharge quickly but this doesn’t help when in the go.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I did have one instance when I thought my right one was dying quick. But after one day it ran out of battery completely and I charged it right away, it was normal.
One thing I would say, I can’t tell the difference between noise canceling but that might be just my ears. Other than that, you get a nice case for it or silicon cover like my Hello Kitty one. Now you have a personalized one for yourself. Love the product so far.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Apple's most innovative product since Steve Jobs' passing,"This is the lowest price I've seen for the best-sounding, most convenient earphones I've owned after collecting at least 200 in the past 15 years.  Apple research went to work, experimentint with hundreds of different ear-shapes and finally came up with a risky new design that's also eminently practical.  They're one size fits all, no more rubber (or expensive Comply foam) tips needed.  They rest on the ear and miraculously stay in place (unless you turn sommersaults or, heaven forbid, are involved in a car crash).

If you're big on noise cancellation and total isolation from the outside world, these probably wouldn't be a #1 choice.  But if you want to hear unobstructed, transparent sound without blocking your ear canal or resorting to earphones that emit another signal into your ear (to zap the same frequencies as those from the outside), these are the ones to own--as so many early doubters and converts have discovered.

Now, a major caveat: The greater percentage of my listening is just prior to going to sleep.  Since the Pods hold fast, more or less, by the principle of gravity, lying down  neutralizes that force and the phones fall out (of my ears, anyway).  My wife uses hers much the same way.  Initially she loved her EarPods.  But then she lost one (our bedroom is where we spend 90% of our time--only because that's where we keep our phones, books, working materials, television set, stereo, a fridge, an ice-maker, etc.).

If you call Apple, they'll sell you the missing single EarPod at a pro-rated price.  However, she immediately lost another EarPod, so now she no longer uses them.  One idle EarPod and two more missing in our house--probably in the mattress unless it fell into a partially used soup or yogurt and was inadvertently tossed.

If she doesn't call Apple, I probably will.  Maybe by the time a loyal Apple customer has lost a certain number (2? 3? 10?) of single EarPods, the company rep will know enough to keep your business by selling them at their cost.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Nice, but not good enough.","I like mobile Apple products and quality. When I first got these (I did not buy them online. I went to an Apple dealer and bought them directly.) I was impressed. But I owned them for 2 years now and it goes downhill. I am reviewing the first generation Air-pods and not the later version.

Pros:
1. They are faithful with connecting each time I pull them from the case and place in my ears. There are few problems with that as there are with other Bluetooth devices.
2. They fit well in the ""ear-well"" and stay. I have an anomaly of a smaller left ear well and canal so the device will shift some. But that is not the fault of the device design.
3. I wore them when I go walking/jogging. They stay in with no problem.
4. I tend not to listen to as much music as talk so the quality of sound is good enough for me.

Cons:
1. After time the battery life diminishes. As I said, I owned them for 2 years now and I may get 1-2 hours out of them before I need to recharge. To compensate, I use one in one ear and when it begins to lose power, I pull the second from the case, place it in the other ear and ensure it is connected  before removing the drained one. Considering the price, I would expect it to last longer. I now use a bone conduction audio device for exercising. It allows me to hear outside noises rather than muffling them with something at my ear canal, stays put and last longer.

I gave 4 stars on sound quality because I know it is not great. But it is good enough.
I give 3 stars for noise cancellation because these are really too small to adequately muffle exterior sounds.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I just received my air pods, which I was really excited to get. When I opened it I immediately thought something was off because the box was not sealed. I did read some reviews about getting used products, but I figured that wouldn't happen. It's never happened before. When I opened them, I could see they are so obviously used and gross.

Not everything and a bag of Doritos.,"While initially enamored of my purchase of the Air Pods, I soon discovered that keeping them or one in my ear was uncomfortable.  I can go for the length of a conversation, but more than that and my ear begins to hurt.  To be fair, I have small ear canals, so... Beyond that, the right AirPod has begun to malfunction, cutting out innumerable times during a conversation despite being fully charged.  I have to manually change the mode back to AirPod each time.  I also am not so taken with the inability to answer an incoming call with the AirPod.  You can ""tap"" it off, I guess, after finishing the call, but one must hunt down one's phone and manually accept the call for the AirPods to work.  I had a BlueTooth for years that was seamless in every way: comfortable, convenient, adjustable in sound,  -- just the best and then they stopped making them.  Too good, I guess. I tried another kind; it lasted for about a day.  Why do these things always claim to be ""improvements'"" but just prove to be less than the initial?",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Meh audio quality, good connectivity","Pros: connectivity is great. Typical apple simplicity in pairing, cracked the case open and whaddyaknow, they were instantly paired. Feature rich when used with my iphone. I do like the auto pause when taking one out, etc.

Cons: if you care about audio at all, like even a little bit, you should know the audio quality is mediocre. Music is soulless, flat, almost no bass response. Sound is maybe slightly better than the free earpods they used to give us. Also, I’m not a fan of the tampon hanging from my ear look.

If you enjoy music, buy something else. There are much, much better options including the typically overrated beats Powerbeats or for half the price,  Creative Outlier Air.
If you just want something that works, has convenient features and don’t care about audio or looks, these are for you.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Almost a 5.,"The headphones after about a week use sometimes needed to be reset because they would disconnect and glitch (only one headphone connecting, only one headphone having a full charge even though the case had a full charge and both were in the case). They also sometimes have pairing problems. When they work perfectly, the use is so seemless. You pop open the case, it tells you the battery percents on your phone if you want to see it, and your listening to music immediately - no waiting, no going into bluetooth settings. If these gltiches were fixed as well as switching between other apples devices of one owner, it would get a 5.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Why you should upgrade from the original Airpods or buy new,"The Good:
-Much faster connection and switching between devices than original Airpods
-Longer battery life
-Can say “Hey Siri” versus double tapping on the original Airpods
-Stylish
-Great sound and microphone works well
-Fits well in ear
-Incredibly easy to use and pair
-Charging case Charges Airpods quickly and reliably
-Can track last location of Airpods with Find iPhone

The Bad:
-A bit expensive but Airpods work the bets with iOS devices

The Bottom Line:
I own both the original and latest model of the Airpods and I think it is worth upgrading from the original Airpods. The new H1 chip is SO much faster for connecting to your device and switching between devices. I use these all the time and the speed of connecting to devices and the longer battery life are worth it to me. I also like being able to say “Hey Siri” on the latest model Airpods versus double tapping on the original models. Most everything else hasn’t changed as the look is the same and the charging case is the same. I did not get the wireless charging case as I thought it was a bit expensive. The sound is still fantastic and the microphone works great (I use these to talk to clients a lot during the day). I like the look of the Airpods compared to some of the other options out there (the Bose ones stick out of your ears pretty far which to me seems strange). Overall, I would recommend either purchasing these latest Airpods if you have an Apple device or upgrading from the original Airpods (for the speed of connecting to your devices alone)!

My Airpod 2nd generation are still going strong and would still highly recommend!

"Great hardware, but caution for any Samsung S10 users","Great bit of hardware - slim form factor, but otherwise it's like a tiny box that you can take with you anywhere.

Earbuds themselves are great, though the fit has me concerned if I'm going to do anything active... but otherwise great for lounging activities. Very comfortable since it's so lightweight, which is huge.

Now if you're like me and had an S10 before buying these... you might be in for some frustration.

Without a firmware update, when paired via Bluetooth the earbuds initially don't output audio. You can fix that by setting in the Bluetooth config to use the device for calls/audio... THIS SETS THE VOLUME TO MAX FOR WHATEVER GOD FORSAKEN REASON (!). When you change the volume after setting it to use the earbuds, the volume is good... until about 10 seconds later when the Bluetooth disconnects and you need to repair, and then experience the joys of random MAX VOLUME blasting again.

To fix that, you can do a firmware upgrade that resolves these issues. And in short the earbuds are unusable with an S10 until you do it.

But the firmware update requires iOS -- so unless you specifically have an iPad or iPhone (Mac doesn't work), you'll need to borrow someone's device.

To top it off, there's no way to manually trigger it -- it just happens automatically once paired with the case charging by the device, so you'll probably need to borrow their device for several hours if you don't own one. For reference, the faulty firmware is the 1A661 firmware, and there's no way to tell what firmware you have unless you check it with an iOS device.

But hey once you resolve the above it's great hardware.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I guess they are pretty good...,"I didn't even consider buying AirPods for a while, as there are definitely many more affordable options for bluetooth earphones. However, I never seemed to be fully satisfied with the other options I tried. The sound quality is great, they connect flawlessly and I love that it's easy to switch between devices.

My only concern is that I have smaller ears and thick, puffy hair. I sometimes find the AirPods will get loose due to the fit or getting caught in my hair. Not a deal breaker for me, but I can't see myself wearing them when I'm too active because I'm fearful I may lose one.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
"Convenient, Good Sound Quality","Most convenient purchase of my life. Easy to walk around the city and have my podcast in my ears on my way to work. Some of which are poor quality so it's nice to have high quality buds so I don't miss a single second of the true crime stories. They stay in my ear so well! And sometimes I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable and light. And the charging case is genius, you put you buds securely away and they charge without you having to think about it. I charge the case every couple days and can listen to fully charged bugs for a solid 1/4 of a day before I need to charge again.

"Great for listening to music/podcasts, but mediocre for phone calls in noisy settings","There are already plenty of reviews highlighting the great sound, battery life, comfort, etc. of AirPods. I agree with those things and have only one complaint... They don't perform as well as Apple EarPods when you have a conversation in a noisy environment or when you want to have a private discussion in a public place. First, when using them for phone calls in noisy settings (e.g., on the street) the microphone picks up the ambient noise and the noise cancelling fails. The EarPods' mic does a better job of blocking ambient noise. The sound of cars whooshing past drowns out the person speaking. Second, if having a conversation that you don't want overheard (e.g., talking while on the bus), you can't pull the mic close to your mouth like you can with EarPods. I'm sure these are common problems with any wireless headset, but I hope Apple continues to improve the devices so that they work better for the use cases above.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Bought @ Walmart, Amazon was sold out when I decided to buy.","I hadn’t planned on ever getting a pair of the Apple AirPods because I honestly didn’t think I’d like them. Well after using them for awhile now, I gotta say they’re hands down my favorite earbuds. Charging case is small enough to fit in the smallest pockets, battery life on the earbuds & case last all day for me. (so if your worried about them dying midway through your day, you’re good.) My other concern with these earbuds was the buds falling out of my ears, and as of right now that hasn’t been an issue. Now the most important thing, for me personally, is the sound quality. I was extremely surprised at how well they sounded. Noise canceling so I’m only hearing my music and not random noises around me. Sound quality is clear and full as well as deep bass. (I’ve been using the Rock EQ, I mainly listen to R&B and Hip-Hop) I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who’s on the market for a pair.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

After, I noticed that the sound quality would turn on extremely loud when I was on specific apps and it was weird.

Love my AirPods,"This is my second set - I use them all the time. The first set stopped holding a charge, but as mentioned, I used them every day for two years.

Convenience tied together while offering an outstanding circumference of bass and treble.,This is my first pair of wireless headphones (coming from the lightning pods) and the convenience is literally easier than plugging in a wire for audio. The literal second you take an AirPod out it will be connected to whichever device you choose. The audio quality is amazing! Cranking the knob to the max and the pods handle heavy bass tracks very well in circumference while tying treble to clarity amongst very busy audio. If you have an iWatch with cellular then you literally don’t need your iPhone anymore. Amazing!!!,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

They stopped working after 3 months.,"I regret I purchased them.  They just stopped working after 3 months.  I contacted Amazon Prime, and Apple support.

Talk about stress.  They worked only a few hours after Apple support had me to blah, blah.  You know the drill.  I noticed they died too quickly after a full charge.  I even deleted some of my music.

I woke up this morning, left ear bud has no sound.  I need them for my early morning jog.  My sane life is over until I actually find earbuds that work.

My family laughed because I paid so much money for them.  Some reviews here are positive.  Yikes

Back to support for the second time.  I really hate it.  Try driving around in traffic in South Florida.  I really need a decent pair of ear buds that actually work.

Why did I wait so long to buy these?,"Disclosure- I didn't buy my airpods from Amazon- I went old school and went the brick and mortar route.  I use wireless headphone daily.  I ride by bike most mornings and use them through the day for music, streaming, podcasts etc.  I resisted buying these because of the high price and fear that i would lose one falling out of my ear or simply misplacing them.  I've been a long time use of the LG series and have used them for almost a decade.  The hang around your neck and plug in your ears the traditional way.  I'm still a big fan of LG earphone because of their cost and quality of sound.  BUT tugging on the earpieces connected by a thin wire eventually causes one or the other to stop working after about a year.  Which isn't that big a deal because you can usually find a pair for under $40 or so.  But I finally broke down when the new gen of Airpods included Siri and all I can say is WHY did i wait so long.  I LOVE the siri feature (so convenient to skip over ads on podcasts :) or switch podcasts or make a call etc) and they simply don't fall out of my ear (even when riding my bike).  If you don't use Siri maybe no reason to go Gen 2 over Gen 1 (but you really should play around with Siri - its a great way to send a text while otherwise occupied - check weather- launch apps etc.  )  The airpods of course pair seamlessly, are comfortable and easy to store and keep track of. And they pair easily with other non apple products (my TV, peloton cycle etc).  They have become my go to headphone of choice.  Once caveat.  They are not noise cancelling.  So on a plane they are adequate for short distance flights  but can't compare to true noise cancelling headphones.  BUT still the best purchase i've made in awhile.  No regrets.  If you can afford them and you're an iphone/apple user go ahead and treat yourself.  You'll love them  PS I didn't buy the wireless charging case since it seemed somewhat needless expenditure. I haven't had any problem keeping the case or the airpods charged.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Evidence someone wore these “new” headphones before reaching me,"The only reason this review has a one star is because upon arrival of these apple airpods, there is evidence of someone wearing them before.

Love em! These are great!,"Have gone through cheap wireless earbuds, but these are really nice. Big guy and the ear piece works just fine. Use ‘em to work out and they work just fine. The only thing is the battery doesn’t last forever. However, the charging case is nice as I can throw them in for a quick charge and get back in the jams. Bought some Plantronics Fits that we’re almost $80 and they disconnect or drop Bluetooth. These are integrated with the Apple ecosystem so SIRI works great. Can assign the left and right earpieces to do different functions.

Noise cancellation? Nope. If you want that buy $300 Bose or Beats and look like Lobot from Star Wars. I still hear conversations from the wife through these. Very important! Very low profile. Silicone skins add extra grip in the ear.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Buyer Beware of Old Charging Case,"I am not an Apple fanatic, but I have been using their devices since ios 3G. I do not “jump” at any product they sell, nor do I live for the next upgrade... heck, if it were up to Apple we would all give them our old devices and buy their next big thingy every 1.5 years. Having said that, I waited to get the AirPod 2 and was exited to see an Amazon “sale” of the “latest model”, that is until I received them and found that only the pods are the latest model... the charging case is the old case with the battery indicator light on the inside of the case. This detail could have easily been provided in the description of the item for the consumer to determine if that would be a deal breaker... but nope, buyer beware!!

The air pods fit perfectly for me, and the sound is rich & full, so once my music starts playing I get over the fact that I was hood winked by seller!! The transaction was excellent with the exception of the non disclosure of the old charging case.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"I wanted to dislike these, but I can't","My kids asked for these for Christmas and received them from others.  I dislike the standard Apple earbuds that come with the iphone, so I wasn't going to blow $170 on cordless ones that were sure to suck AND get lost.  Nope!  Can't fool this guy!  Yeah.  Well, then the kids each received a pair and were so engrossed in using them that I got curious.  My kiddos are 17 and 18, by the way.  I promptly stole one airbud from the unwary ear of my son, expecting nothing much, and WOW!  I'm impressed!  The sound quality is REALLY GOOD for such small drivers!!  Okay, they don't pack the depth of range my over-ear Bose headphones do, but they still provide shockingly impressive bass for an ear bud!  I then learned that you can use them for phone conversations; that taking one out of your ear automatically pauses the music; that tapping the left or right bud can be programmed to do a variety of functions, and more.  Sooooo, three months later I caved in and bought myself a pair of these ridiculously cool things.  Sound quality is excellent, they stay in my ears perfectly, even when I tried intentionally to shake them out (just gave myself a headache...the buds stayed firmly in place), and they don't cause my ears to hurt like traditional earbuds do.  I'm sold!  And yes, my kids made some snarky comments about OLD people refusing to accept this here newfangled tech-no-lo-gee gadgety stuff.  What can I say?  These things are cool.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Pros and cons, but overall disappointed.","These don't stay in my ears, I had to buy separate in-ear style pieces. They don't always connect with my iPhone and I have to ""forget this device"" in Bluetooth settings and start over. The auto pause function when removing from ears doesn't always work either. (Very annoying when you lose your place in your audiobook!). This happens whether I have the in-ear pieces on or not. The sound quality is good, but I don't think there is any noise cancelling effect at all. I can't hear the audio clearly when vacuuming like I can with other cheap wired headphones. The only reason I didn't return these for another brand is that they can be used one at a time unlike other brands. Overall I'm disappointed with Apple, especially for the price. They would be totally worth it if they worked well and had different options for earbud styles.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Great Wireless Headphones,"This is more of a review on the order than of the airpods themselves. I recently ordered mine and was concerned due to some of the reviews about how they weren't in fact the 2nd gen or that they didn't work properly. Well, after using mine for a few days now (I know that's not the longest time to be certain of quality, but if anything goes wrong with them down the road, I will update this review accordingly.) I can say that they are the legitimate 2nd gen Apple AirPods. They arrived perfectly packaged with no damage and I have had no issues with the pods themselves, they connect perfect just like they should and the sound quality is better than I expected, not the best, but definitely good enough. I take these with me everywhere and I found them especially nice going to the grocery store where there are a large amount of people crowding around, the airpods helped me just zone out. Definitely would recommend these to anyone who is in the market for wireless headphones, but if you already have a working pair of gen 1 airpods, probably not worth upgrading",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Fantastic earbuds, but underwhelming compared to 1st gen","Owned a pair of 1st gen Airpods and they were fantastic; I was blessed with compatible ear canals and all was good. That pair was stolen/misplaced, so I figured I'd just ""future proof"" and go with gen 2 when replacing them. Got my 2nd gen Airpods and they were also fantastic. If you're looking for a quality pair of BT earbuds that ""just work"" then I'd absolutely recommend either G1/G2 (assuming a typical wired pair of Apple earbuds fit you well).

However, the changes between generations is incredibly minimal and if you aren't someone who cares/uses the quick charging, it's doubtful you'd notice a difference between the two. Sure a new chip and wireless charging are indeed improvements to specs, but they offer limited actual use-case improvements. I assumed that the battery must've been improved in the 2nd gen models, but it's literally the same exact battery: 398 mAh case battery & 93 milliwatt battery for the actual pods. I'm a longtime Apple user who grew to love their products, but within the last couple years I've branched out and started building PCs as a hobby and it all started, because I just got fed up with what the company has become in the Tim Cook era. It's why I wasn't surprised when I figured out gen2 was essentially a rehash. About a month ago, my late 2008 unibody Macbook (not pro) had finally been retired; after a solid 11 years of service that included upgrades w/ a SSD + 4x stock RAM I decided it was time for a new notebook not because of hardware performance, but actually due to Apple locking those older models out of OS/Safari updates. I took a look at some current model MacBook pros and it's so disappointing to see how far this company has fallen. I became an Apple user because at the time I knew I was getting top quality hardware that would justify the pricetag by providing longevity and overall value thanks to the ease of user-repairs. The hardware is still quality today, but the price premium is no longer justified as rather than paying for the option of future hardware upgrades/longevity, you're now paying a premium just because it's Apple. It's a slap in the face to consumers and a practice I can no longer support. I'll continue supporting innovative products like Airpods where there (wasn't) another market competitor, but I refuse to continue buying Apple because Apple.

Tl;DR: Fantastic earbuds, but don't upgrade if you already have a pair of gen 1 pods.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I like them,"I'm not really sure how helpful a review is at this point. Everyone who's going to buy AirPods already knows that they like them or not. Apple is releasing some AirPods with noise cancellation, I think that's the biggest complaint most people have: that they don't feel like they're deafened to the world around them. But everytime someone comes into my office I have to stop the music or take the AirPods completely out of my ears to hear them clearly. The sound quality is decent. I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great. They also are easy to lose, but so are any other tiny cordless in-ear earphones. Just keep track of them and you should be good to go. At first they hurt my ears so I bought some silicone covers with wingtips. They helped the AirPods stay in my ears without moving around and ""softened"" the edges of the earphones. I guess they stretched my ears out or I just got used to wearing them, because now even without the silicone covers they fit and feel just fine. The battery life is pretty good, and popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes boosts them almost back up to full. So I'll wear them at work and then if I get up to grab a drink or use the bathroom I'll give the AirPods a quick charge and be good to go the rest of the day. At first double-tapping to get them to pause or skip a song was frustrating but there's a tutorial online somewhere that shows you where to tap to get consistent results: just above the neck of the AirPods. They pair immediately with your iPhone and I've never had any connectivity issues or sound quality issues, so I'm very happy with my purchase.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Possible defected AirPod?,"I can’t really give a full review on this. I will say that when I first opened them both pods( left and right) worked. However, after trying them on a second time.

There was simply no way to have both AirPods work at the same time. Once I put both AirPods in the case. The flashing amber lights come on. I did try to hold the button for 15 seconds.

I purchased new AirPods and received used AirPods,"Note: 1 star due to receiving used product after purchasing new product. This review does not relate to product functionality.

After waiting two weeks due to the back order, I finally received my AirPods I ordered. As soon as I opened the box I knew something was off as the typical plastic wrap around new Apple product boxes was not there. The case also was a little dirty which again is not typical of Apple quality control. I went to pair the headphones to my phone and they popped up as “Charles’s AirPods.” Needless to say I’m not Charles and this product purchased was not the product received, so now I am having to return them, wait for refund, and try again.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Not my favorite. Buggy.,"I have problems with the Audio becoming desynced and some annoying issues with old firmware. There was also a rather nasty bug with the model I received. It nearly made me deaf - if you don't know to update the thing (which is a problem for Android...) then you might suffer some hearing damage. I used them for days with the bug and was on the cusp of returning them. The bug is that the audio defaults to maximum volume - with any device (iOS, Android, etc) - until the software is updated. This volume setting reverts to maximum everytime the device enters a power saving state. They sleep aggressive (like maybe 5 seconds of silence). So, if you're streaming music and it takes more than 5 seconds to fetch the next song -- you're getting blasted at full volume force from a device directly inserted into your ear. Very painful. Again, if you just update them they're fine. I was able to reproduce the problem on multiple devices and it wasnt until I updated my airpods that the problem went away. Now the only problem I have is the occasional desync of audio. It's easily fixed and a lot of other people have the same issue sadly. I have noticed that holding the phone differently affects the rate at which desync occurs, so probably just something with signaling. Leaving the phone flat and uncovered/held remedies my issue. When they work, they're really nice. But overall the initial frustrations really took it's toll on my ability to like this product. Hopefully there's better QA on the next generation.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

FAKE!! Check the serial number as soon as you receive them,"I was so happy with my AirPods (I had delayed getting them this long because of the price tag), but absolutely worth it once received. However, just over a month after receiving them the left AirPod failed. I contacted Amazon who connected me to Apple to set up an appointment. When I got to the appointment, I learned from the serial numbers that these are 100% FAKE.

I am an extremely loyal Amazon customer, however, I was blown away that an item sold by Amazon and is also an ""Amazon Choice"" item could be a counterfeit. I went back to Amazon who first tried to tell me that the return window had closed but when I said that I would only accept a refund or a verified Apple AirPod replacement finally issued the refund. I only skimmed the reviews, however, I did not see anyone having a similar issue so I would suggest that if you order these, verify the serial number with Apple as soon as you receive them so you don't have the same problem.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Wireless with comfort and function,Game changer if you want wireless ear phones that are comfortable and work well with the iPhone,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Absolutely amazing,I debated getting a pair of these as I thought I was content with the pair of earbuds that come with the phone but I’m super glad I purchased these. First of all I feel like these were a wonderful price compared to apple and even as a refurbished product these are amazing. The sound quality is amazing and I love not having a cord dangling around having to deal with. They easily pair with apple devices and thought I haven’t tried pairing with a non apple Bluetooth device it’s supposed to be easy as well. There’s a button the case you press to pair with a non apple Bluetooth device which is convenient. The battery life blows me away. They constantly Stay charged in the case and I have only had to charge the case a couple times in the few months I’ve had these. Very convenient and definitely worth purchasing if you’re on the fence.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Best wireless earbuds!!!,"My wife gifted these earbuds and I love them so much. I am really picky when it comes to headphones or earphones or earbuds. I have tried so many products nothing works for me or pleases me except Apple Airpods.  It is so light weight that sometimes I had to push to feel them to see if they are still in my ears. The only issues are low bass and at this price point these are not noise cancelling. Overall they are one of the best earbuds, I may buy one more as a backup.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Good, AT FIRST","Great sound. they were great at first but then started to not charge as much and soon stopped charging altogether. I thought I somehow broke it, but it turns out they are intentionally designed to break after a year.

"Great Product, Not Latest Model","Over all, these AirPods are pretty great. I have been using them everyday for the last few weeks and haven’t had any problems. And I’m very happy with the battery life. I can get away with charging the case probably about once a week. The only major problem is that these are not actually the latest model of AirPods, as the case does not have the charging light on the outside.

Also, for those wondering about shipping times, I ordered these while they were listed as out of stock and they took about two weeks to ship, and one week after that for them to deliver.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Better than the last. If they fit your ears and you buy Apple, they're worth it","Noticeably better than the previous generation in sound quality. The 2nd one feels to work the same, but the audio quality is noticeable. Where the 1st was very mediocre and had no bass or great mid, the 2nd is a quite a bit better at (and I think louder but not sure if my comparison 1st gen has issues).

The battery life seems to match the spec and is great but time will tell since the 1st gen decreased to 50% life in a year time.

Last, Hey Siri is kind of cool, but it doesn't look like it works outside the iPhone or watch pairing. Not sure why it wouldn't be able to though.. Besides that it's very limited and I don't find myself using it much but  otherwise it's nice to have available for fitness.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

They were insanely simple to connect to my phone and then I was able to have them connected to my other devices as well. The battery life is perfect too.

Easy access,"The AirPods are very easy to put on and put away. I don’t have to struggle with unwiring my old ones anyone. The battery life of this AirPod is pretty long. I only use it during my commute which is 1.5 hrs. The case still has battery after 4 days of charging.

confused?,"i was really mislead on the name. when I received them i was like, “CoOl! I’ll have floating ear buds."" and that is where my dream was ripped from my soul.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
"Comfortable wireless earbuds, worth the price","These air pods have surprisingly good battery life and are really comfortable to wear. I primarily use my air pods during work. So probably 5-8 hours a work day. I use them intermittently due to having to interact with my coworkers. I charge them every time I have to give someone my attention. As a result of that I've never ran out of battery life in a single day. I also find them extremely comfortable, like I forget they are even there sometimes if I paused my audiobook. While I don't exercise with them, I haven't had one fall out yet during regular use. But I am cautious enough to not use them around water as I fear they might fall out and be damaged in such circumstances.

Unfortunately, we are only allowed one earbud in while we work. Some areas of my workspace are loud due primarily to large AC units and conveyors converging in certain areas. Due to this, I do have one complaint about them. They don't cancel noise very well. I used to have another pair of wireless ear buds and they were much better at cancelling out sound, even with one ear free. As a result I am frequently having to pause my audiobook in these areas as I don't want to blow out one of my eardrums trying to overpower the external sounds with raising the volume of my device.

As to regards about sound quality, I find them good for my purposes. Listening to podcasts and audiobooks in standard quality. I have decent headphones at home if I want an audiophile experience with high quality audio formats especially with music, games, and shows. But the air pods don't necessarily sound terrible. They are just a little annoying to pair between my iphone and pc back and forth. (Not a fan of Macs, sorry apple crowd)

As I only use them while I work, I don't take calls, so I can't comment on the sound receiving end of the earbuds and their use as a headset.

Overall I think they are pretty great product. I did receive the newest model, it was factory sealed and did not appear to have been used. I read a couple of bad reviews and I was particularly worried about receiving a previous model or returned item sold as new. Thankfully everything was fine.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I could have an off pair of AirPods.,"For being $160 I’d expect better quality. The two plastic pieces of the left AirPod were glued off-centered, which really bothered me. Seems like they were put together by someone that didn’t pay attention to detail. I shifted the pieces to center them, but now I’m worried the glue isn’t sound proofing the left AirPod.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Disappointing Apple product,"Very disappointed. First time I’ve ever been disappointed with an Apple product. The case does not evenly charge both ear pods, resulting in one getting a full charge and sometimes the other not getting charged at all. I get disconnected from calls frequently, sometimes others can’t hear me (I have no trouble hearing others), and the charge does not hold as long as it’s supposed to. Perhaps I was sold a defective product. Regardless, most times I end up having to switch to my always reliable corded ear buds. Definitely not worth the hassle or the money.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Great Investment!!!!!!!!,"Incredible quality and sound!!!!!!! I wasn’t so sure about the fit inside the ear because my corded earbuds would always fall out of my ear but these are a tighter fit and because there’s no cord they stay in position during physical activities such as walking or just moving around!!!!

They are just amazing!!!,"These are the best pair of wireless earphones I ever came across, apple has definitely done it again. Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device.
You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback.
The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small.
Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Cool,"Compre los airpods porque necesitaba unos audifonos inalambricos porque son muy funcionales. Sin embargo, me ha pasado:

Cons:
1. No lo logro conectar mis airpods con mi macbook air por medio de bluetooth. Se conectan y al segundo se desconectan. Me tocara mirar videos en youtube para poder arreglar el problema.

2. El audifono derecho molesta mucho cuando hablo por telefono. Se oye como un ruido muy raro que molesta mucho. Ya me ha pasado varias veces en un periodo corto entonces los llevare al servicio tecnico en la tienda Apple.

Pros:
1. Son demasiado funcionales. Me los pongo y puedo hacer muchas actividades sin tener el cable regular de los audifonos pegado al celular y tener que llevar los dos de la mano.

2. Se acomodan al oido muy bien. No he tenido ningun problema con que se me caigan mientras camino. No los he usado mientras corro.

3. Son lo mejor cuando quiero hablar por telefono u oir musica y al mismo tiempo tengo que cargar mi celular. Antes cuando usaba los audifonos de cable tenia que usarlos o cargar mi celular. Ahora puedo hacer los dos al tiempo  sin ningun problema.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Disappointing,"I had two issues with these ear buds (which I eventually returned). First, I do not have an apple phone, and while the ear buds are supposed to work with other devices - and they do - the sound quality is quite poor. the volume level is just so-so at max volume. I was disappointed because the item I wanted them to work with was an Apple product (IPod Nano). I took it to the Apple store near me and the tech person who worked with me agreed. So, if you are buying to work with your Apple phone (which my wife has), they are fine. Other than that and you will be disappointed.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Not recommended for Android phones,"These airpods are light, comfortable and generally produced and received well for calls. Overall though, I would not recommend for Android phones (despite what other reviews tell you).

I'd searched ahead of time and plenty of Android-phone users seemed to have good experiences despite this being an Apple product (which obviously works better with other Apple products). I wanted to try them because of the lightweight comfortable fit that many people had raved about, long battery life, as well as the tap functions. I didn't realize how annoying the bugs for Android would be though, even after forcing a firmware update the main issues consistently recur:

1. Slipping out of sync (between left and right, sometimes more and more out of sync, if I don't pause and replay, or unsync and re-pair)

2. Audio cut-outs - usually not if you have uninterrupted line-of-sight, but if my phone is in my pocket or bag, then it was guaranteed to cut out.

Between backorder delay, and delay to return due to trying to troubleshoot the issues with re-pairing and firmware updating, I'm unable to do a return now :(",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Good beat, quick charge, easy fit in the ears, and stylish","I wouldn’t call myself an Apple fanboy but their devices simply work, and do the one thing they are designated to do better than any other of its competitors. Now, I am not saying that there aren’t better earpieces but pair of AirPods simply music, style, and beat into one. One negative thing about is the fact of noise cancellation being almost none existent. Especially in the subway when the trains are passing by the only sound you hear is the sound of the train and nothing else despite having the AirPods on. Apart from noise cancellation AirPods blow away any other earpieces I’ve owned. With them having discount of 20 bucks I decided to get a pair and they are exactly what I hoped for. If Apple comes up with a newer model that takes care of the noise cancellation issue I will definitely upgrade.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Good Deal,"I ordered my Airpods on the 4th of July and they arrived one week later on the 11th of July (without Prime). I also ordered them on sale for $144.99 and it was a very good purchase in my opinion. Pretty good sound quality, not the best out there compared to other earbuds like the Powerbeats Pros, but for over $100 cheaper with the sale I was quick to buy Airpods instead. It’s obvious biggest flaw is the ambient noise they let in but you get used to it. Also I used to be against Apples one size fits all style of earbud because they did not fitmy ears correctly, but an inexpensive AirPod tip purchase helped to keep them snug in my ear during workouts so they wouldn’t fall out.

"These have excellent sound quality and great Bass, too. I think the price is well worth it! LOVE EM!","I have tried several “cheaper” imitations of AirPods and they were just ok. I have been waiting to get these and let me tell you, I’m sold. THESE ARE GREAT! As soon as I got them, I had to try them out. First of all, they paired with my iPhone XR, almost instantly. All I had to do was have my phone open and near the AirPods, while they were still in the charging case, open the lid and within seconds they paired! It displays the charge of both the AirPods and the case on your phone, too! Super cool! I selected one of my favorite Classic Rock bands and started jamming. The sound quality was awesome! These have a excellent Bass response, too. These were a outstanding purchase for me. I’m so glad that I patiently waited for the AirPod 2s! I had been reading a lot of expert reviews about them. The original AirPods are good I have heard, but for several improvements these are even better. I definitely recommend them.

AirPod 2 vs Jabra Actives,"I have both the AirPods and the Jabra Elite Actives. I like them both but for different reasons
AirPods Pros
- light,
-comfortable,
-Wonderful phone call performance (at both ends)
- great charging case
-5 hour battery life
- open design allows you to hear traffic, conversations, etc (this is a negative in noisy environments)
AirPod Cons:
- will not stay in without earhooks
- Not water/sweat proof.
Jabra Pros:
- great sound isolation (especially with Comfort tips)
- better base than AirPods,
- good battery life,
-not as obtrusive as the q-tip AirPods
-Much better water/sweat protection
Jabra Cons:
- the absolute worst customer service you will EVER find. Hope you will never have to use it. I had to return two before I got a pair that worked. THANK YOU AMAZON!

If I had to buy just one, it would be the AirPods. But, the Jabras are better in the gym or in noisy environments.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Apple AirPods,"I believe that this product that Apple product is one of the better ones that the company has made other than the iPhone and that is because of things such as the quality of sound that the product produces. I enjoy headphones that don't allow people around me to be able to hear my music when I have it turned up because I enjoy listening to my music loud, and as I have found with other headphones they exert lots of sound when the volume is turned up. Another quality aspect of the headphones is the battery life. I enjoy using Bluetooth headphones and a majority of the ones that I have had before this have had terrible battery life, but I would say the AirPods have about a 5 hour battery life which is quality for bluetooth headphones. Some cons I have about the AirPods are that while they are supposed to be tiny I find that they get lost frequently and they have no action on them sort of like the find-my-iPhone setting that the phones have. Another con about the AirPods I would say is the noise cancellation could be better. But, overall I would say that these are a high quality product and I enjoy using them everyday.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I can wear them all day and never miss a beat, versus the thirty minutes tops those ones with rubber pieces that hurt my ears. They connect almost instantly, no need to try to pair them or anything like that. They sound fantastic and have a surprising amount of bass.

Prefer to Beats Powerbeats Pro primarily for running,"I wanted wireless headphones mostly for running, but also to use casually for conference calls and listening to music/podcasts. From the outset I assumed the Powerbeats would be the best for me and got those. While they are very good, it didn't blow me away. It wasn't so much better than the $30 bluetooth headphones I got 3 years ago. I also struggled to get a good fit in my one ear. What made me send it back though, was that it is just too bulky. The carrying case is huge and even the earphones without the case are big, and I didn't just want to put them in my denim pockets, as they have protrusions that might get damaged or break off. Bottom line, you can't just keep them in your pockets ""just in case"". Every time you want to take it somewhere you have to make space for it somewhere.

So I got the Airpods. I was very skeptical that:
1. They would fall out when running
2. They would not survive the sweat I generate in the Atlanta summer during 13 miles jogs

I watched some YouTube videos testing their water tolerance and I was surprised that people reported them fully functional after a wash/dry cycle (obviously not recommended). I pulled the trigger and bought it and am happy to report that they work perfectly for running. The sounds is good (not quite as great as the Powerbeats), and they don't fall out at all while running. I thought I'd might need an after market silicone casing or ear hook, but found I didn't need it.

The main reason I removed 1 star is because they are very slippery. Even when the Airpods and your hands are dry, it's slippery and prone to falling when taking it out. When the Airpods and your hands are both wet and slippery, they become like a wet piece of soap, almost impossible to handle. Apple should make it a bit more grippy.

Overall, great product and what really sealed the deal is the portability and the fact that I can carry the Airpods on me all the time.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Apple has done it again!,"At first I wasn't a fan of wireless airpods. I thought they were douchy and people walking around with them seemed to reflect that. I am a true hard-wired headphone type of guy. While I enjoy most Apple products, these are phenomenal! I am a true audiophile and the quality of sound is very good. I saw these priced at the Apple Store for $199, but for a bit less on Amazon, they are worth the price. I added this to my arsenal of devices I carry and I don't mind to have yet another thing to charge and keep track of. The AirPods also are very comfortable and emit a sound when you insert them into your ear. The SIRI activation is also pleasant and nice.  Overall I recommend these for those who enjoy great sound quality and convenience!",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Best I've Found For Phone Calls.,I don't listen to music with my wireless headphones. I use them mostly for phone calls and Marco Polo. I have searched for 2 years for a wireless headset that filters out ambient noise so that the caller on the other end can hear my voice clearly. My search is now over. Nothing I've used works better than Apple Airpods. I don't know how Apple does it but they use some kind of technology that isolates the frequency of your voice and separates it from background noise. Its truly amazing. If you're tired of having the person on the other end of a phone call tell you they can't hear you very well because there's too much noise then these are the headphones for you.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Don’t sweat on them or they will break!,Bought a pair for my husband from Apple at Christmas.  He used them on his workouts and they just stopped working.  He took them into Apple and they wouldn’t replace them because of water damage.  He let them know that he does sweat during his workout but never got them wet.  He even let them sit out if the case after a workout to make sure he didn’t put them in the case wet.  The “Genius Bar” persons said that the air buds were tested with synthetic sweat and should be fine for working out and that he must have go them wet and they wouldn’t replace them.

Fantastic purchase! Worth every penny.,"I love love love these air buds. I’m on the phone a lot for work and appreciate the seamless usability. These guys synced with my phone the moment I opened the case for the first time (I had to touch the phone once to accept the sync).

I’ll often use just the one bud, it runs out and I put in the other. That’s helpful for continuous calls and if I want to listen to tunes while running errands.  They fit nicely in my ears (even after long wear times).

SKIP- it’s what they do,"I’ve spent most of the time I’ve owned these trying to decide if they’re were real.

AND I can’t wirelessly charge them. I wish I could return them. Save the money, buy the gen1.

As far as the new audio chip? It’s not better enough to justify the price change and certainly not when you add in how crappy they are. Source: I’m a professional audio engineer.

These are BRAND NEW SECOND GENERATION AIRPODS,"I received a brand new set of AirPods from this seller.  The Model Number of the pair is A2031, which is the 2nd generation model.  The Hardware Version is 1.0.0.  (To get this information, open your AirPod case near your iPhone, then on your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About and scroll down to where your AirPod is listed and click on it to get the hardware/firmware information.)

I'm disappointed that the battery doesn't last any longer than the first generation set I owned.  They go dead before the end of two back-to-back conference calls.  I haven't tried listening to music with them, so I have no idea how long they'd last doing that.

Left Airpod Didn't Work,"This is one of the purchases where everything that could go wrong did go wrong...
The first time I purchased the Airpods with the additional AppleCare, I waited anxiously for them to arrive. I happened to be at home on the expected day of delivery so I was surprised when I saw the delivery status 'Customer Refused Delivery.' Nope. That definitely didn't happen. I called into Amazon's customer service, who told me, ""Disregard that status message. They are Airpods - they probably got stolen. Things can go missing between the warehouse and delivery."" Uh, ok. They refunded both the Airpods and the AppleCare, as (THIS IS IMPORTANT) the AppleCare, though sold separately, is connected to the device via the serial number when purchased.
Cut to my second attempt at purchasing the Airpods and the AppleCare... I received the Airpods, and like so many others who have purchased them and left reviews, the left Airpod was defective. I returned the Airpods and received a refund with no issue. However, when I inquired with customer service about refunding the AppleCare (because as I mentioned, when purchased, it is associated with the Airpods via serial number), I was told that a one time exception had already been made for me and they couldn't refund it again. So, because of what was an issue on Amazon's end initially, I'm now screwed out $29 for the AppleCare purchase when I was sent defective Airpods.
If you are willing to buy these Airpods after so many reviewers, including myself, provide feedback stating this product is defective, don't waste your money on the AppleCare.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Good true wireless option,"Purchased these more so for gym convenience as needed a true wireless headphone that would easily sync with my Apple Watch. Although they are not waterproof that doesn’t bother me as I don’t sweat a lot. There is no noise cancelling and the sound quality isn’t nearly as great as a pair of BeatsX. However, with the combination of the Ahastyle silicone earbud everything is greatly improved, protected, and the AirPods stay in my ear. The talking quality is clear so no complaints there. The connectivity to Apple products is very fast with the new chip, so can’t complaint about that either.

The biggest issue I have is that the “tap” feature after setting it up on my phone in my experience is a HASSLE! Maybe I just don’t have that special touch, but I know plenty of people who say the same. I just avoid using the feature as it’s faster to switch music tracks or hang up a call from my other Apple products. Also, It would also be nice to control the volume from the AirPod itself rather than the device or saying “hey Siri” all the time. An 8+ hour one-time charge battery life would be great too.

Overall, the price I paid when they were on sale and getting total wireless for my gym purposes was a good deal compared to the new Powerbeats Pro price and ear-hook style!",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Premium price , poor product. No volume control buttons.","So disappointed in these second generation Apple Airpods that I bought as a gift, the recipient could not use them (bad fit, volume control issues) so I tried them.
They do not sit well in the ear, they are advertised for use during sports, among other things, but are really poorly thought out , the Airpods frequently fall out making them unsuitable for cycling. They leak sound really badly , making them unsuitable for use around other people or in quiet locations. The battery life is terrible at 1-2 hours. The sound quality is OK, on a par with earphones like the ones airlines give away.
Definitely not worth the price and to top it all Apple appear to be limiting the compatibility with other wearables  (or are doing something with licensing fees) for example the Airpods do not work with Fitbit Versa devices (no volume control) .  Even with the iphone there is no way to adjust the volume without getting out the phone or invoking Siri. Just imaging having to say ,hey Siri turn the volume up/down during a flight or similar.
Purchased a set of TaoTronics bluetooth headphones, better fit, battery, have a volume control and work with the fitbit Versa, oh and a fraction of the price.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
"USED AIRPODS, NO GOOD","So I got a used version because it was roughly 10 bucks cheaper. Came in the mail and the box was a little beat up, which is expected. HOWEVER, the AirPods themselves were DIRTY! As in earwax covered nearly the entire speaker (I decided to save your eyes by not showing photo evidence). How can someone have that much earwax??? I expect that Amazon would at least clean the used item and disinfect it from the prior use, but they did not. THANKS CHRIS, FORMER OWNER OF THE AIRPODS. After a DEEP cleaning, they work fine and I love how the bass sounds in some songs.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

They were oddly dirty for new airpods..,"I got these from my husband for my birthday, I've been wanting them so I was super excited!

Once I got it all unwrapped a noticed a small black piece of fuzz on the outside of the case. I brushed it off, thinking it came from me and didn't think twice about it. But when I opened the case, there was also some very tiny brown specks of dirt? dust? inside and a piece of dirt on one of them that when I wiped it, it actually left a smudge I had to scrape off with my fingernail. I didn't think to take a picture until I removed the second earbud that also had specks on it and it was hard to get a picture since the specks are tiny (theres three specks by the part that goes into your ear, and two on the longer part).

Very strange for new Airpods. Other than that, so far so good.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Easy to use, nothing changed than older model","airpod2 is really easy to use.
I bought it as a gift to my wife, but the earphone does not fit well with my ears, so it falls off well, but airpod2 does not fall out of my ears without worrying about it.
Unfortunately, noise cancellation is not supported and there is no difference from existing models.
Still, airpod2 has advantages and disadvantages to cover all of it.

Compared to 1st Generation,"This is the 2nd generation airpods 

List of changes: 

1.  H1 chip (vs W1 chip) supporting hands-free ""Hey Siri"". 

No need to double tap on earbuds, just use voice controls. It's like a portable Amazon Echo, Google Home smart, Apple home pods device on your ears (but only for Apple devices).

May feel a bit odd talking to your airpods in public, but as it catches on, people will just shrug it off especially in a city setting

2. Better battery life. 

Up to 1 hour more talk time depending on volume setting and distance away from phone, apple device

You get around 4 hours talk time and approximately 6 hour music playback per full charge

3. Faster device connection times. 

Not by much, maybe half a millisecond. 

Answer calls 2x faster than original (less lag when picking up calls)

===

Misc info/features:

Audio remains the same as first generation. Sound quality very similar stock wired Apple earbuds. Audio very smooth, no lag or audio hiccups 

Has two microphones. Audio quality from recipient are similar to wired counterparts. Apple claim it helps filters out background noise, but does not work as well as other noise cancelling headsets. I personally can't tell difference from wired ear pods. Unlike wired, you don't have to lift/hold up mic to your mouth when other party can't hear you which is a plus.

Fit. Varies by person due to ear shape. Slightly tighter/snug fit than wired counterpart. If those don't fall off on their own (without tension/tug on wires) when out-and-about and doing physical activities then these won't either. 

Built-in accelerometers and optical sensors. Able to pause audio by tapping on earbuds or double tap for Siri. Again able to use voice controls by saying ""Hey Siri"" without tapping. Detects in-ear placement, which enables automatic pausing when one ear bud is taken out of the ears. Can resume with one ear piece on ear, but need to hit resume on Apple device.

Compatibility. Works with any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0. Also works with Android, but won't have the seamless auto switching between devices via icloud/Apple ID. When using Android it acts like regular bluetooth headset. For the price, it's not worth it on Android unless you like the visual aesthetic, as there's better options out there. For Apple users with multiple Apple devices it very convenient; just set it up once via bluetooth/sync button on case, and don't worry about audio syncing across Apple devices. This feature is compatible with devices running iOS 12.2 or later, macOS 10.14.4 or later, or watchOS 5.2 or later.

Optional wireless charging case can be purchased separately and is also compatible with 1st generation AirPods. Wirelessly charge via any Qi wireless charging pad, takes 1.5 longer for full charge compared to wired charging.

 This version charges via lighting cable. Takes around 3 hours for full charge.Very easy to drop wireless earbuds in case for storage or charging. Has a very satisfying click sound when closing lid.

Airpods and charging case has own separate battery indicators viewable via Apple device. 

Case holds 4-5 charges for airpods when full. 

Has a find phone feature and vice versa. Airpods will make a sound at max volume and give approximate GPS location on app. 

No water resistance, no soft touch texture like on Apple pencil (feels like wired Apple earpods with cords cut out and longer/thicker stem).

Conclusion 

Overall, wireless version of the stock wired Apple earbuds you get with your iphone with better features. Seamless audio pairing across all Apple devices with Apple ID registered, very convenient and life changing after you use it for a while.

 

Not recommended for Andriod users unless you like how Apple Airpods looks. 

If you own first generation, not worth the upgrade unless you plan to use the hands free ""Hey Siri"" function often. 

Another option you can get is the Power Beats Pro which also have H1 chip and similar features. Additional features include around the ear design for better fit, sweat and water resistance, noise isolation, in-ear buds, better audio, and has multiple color options. Bad thing about Power Beats Pro is that it may not be as fashionable, has a huge case, has no wireless charging option and cost a bit more MSRP.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
WOW my first AirPods,"not a apple fan, but been using this for a few months now. i am very impressed with its sound quality. the only thing i have to complain about is dust and the earpieces seems to fall out of my ears when it's hot and sweaty. recommend buying a silicone string so that when that happens, the earpieces won't fall to the ground or get lost.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Everything was good... but noise cancellation could be better,"The sound quality is very good but when I compare it with the Beat earbud I think the Beat is a bit better.  Noise cancelling is not as good.  I tried using it in the plane and it wasn't as quiet as I experienced with other noise cancelling earbuds.  That said, the sound quality is very good in a more quiet room.  I like how easy it was to pair with the phone. This does come with the charging case which is very handy.  It is also very compact.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Unbelievably wonderful!,"Because of my job, I've had to deal with wearing bluetooths for the majority of the last 10 years, and I've detested every moment of it!  After an hour of having the old style in, I'd be forced to move the bluetooth device to my other ear as they were literally painful.  I got very tired of wearing bluetooth devices, to say the least.  After reading the comments regarding the Gen 2 airpods, I decided to take a gamble and buy them.  Am I glad I did!  I've only had them for one week, but the comfort of wearing them is off the chart, the sound quality is unbelievable, and the fact that the charging case will keep them available to me is wonderful.  I took them to a friend's house last night and let him try them.  He's always been a huge audiophile and prior to putting them in his ears voiced his skeptimism as to how good these """"Itty-bitty"" airpods could possibly be.  To make a long story short, I had to almost fight him to get my airpods back!  Lol!  He let me know that he would be purchasing a pair of his own in the near future, and made mention of how unbelievably comfortable they were as well, and he had them in for a couple of hours at least.  My $144.95 gamble definitely paid off, and I am very happy I made the jump to Apple!",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Super light and comfortable!,These are very light. It's hard to imagine how some find these uncomfortable since they don't weigh anything. I wore one while working and with plenty of background noise and I could hear the airpod loud and clear. I also used with the Apple Watch w/cellular and that combo is excellent as well.  I haven't ran one dead yet but I don't listen to music all day long either.  The charging case really would fix and battery concerns though.  As far as music goes there's not really any bass.  It still sounds great.  I can't say whether any other ear buds are better though so may not be an issue.  They do seem to stay in the ear for all activities.  If you are wearing them under a helmet or hoodie (like I do) they can get pulled loose but I wouldn't worry about it falling out otherwise.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Sure, you can't afford these... but buy them anyway.","If you don't have AirPods yet, you may or may not know just how annoying earbud wires are.  If you don't have them yet, AirPods seem like a slight improvement from those much less expensive earbuds that came with your phone.  I came hear to tell you that AirPods are without a doubt the smartest purchase you'll make today.  Maybe, like me, you can't really justify spending $160 on earbuds, since you already have a pair and they're - fine.  Well... sometimes the key to success is learning to ignore your own ignorance.  There are things you shouldn't bother spending money on (cable tv, birthday cards, men's underwear that isn't Merino wool, meat at Wal-mart, etc.)  AirPods are not on that list.
 So stop questioning it.  Buy these magic ear spoons.  You'll bounce back financially in no time and forget you ever spent the money.  Sure, AirPodsare a little expensive, but consider the cost of not owning them.

And no they won't fall out of your ears - unless you're driving on a back road in Maine in late February.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Easy to use, small","After having these for about a day, it feels amazing to not have a wire. I can move freely without worrying about pulling my headphones out accidentally, especially while I am at work carrying boxes.

One complaint that some people have is that the airpods fall out or don’t fit their ears. I haven’t had this problem, and they fit perfectly. I haven’t tried to run with them in yet, so I’m not sure how they stay in while I am running.

I do advise being careful when taking them out of the case though. They are really small and they could fall if you don’t grab them when they come off the charger in the case.

They connect to apple devices EXTREMELY easily. All that is required is you open the case and hold it up near your device while the case is opened, and pair from the popup on your phone. Regular bluetooth connections are possible by holding the button down on the back of the case.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

First Pair overheated but Second Pair is great!,"If this were a review on the first pair I had I would tell you I hated them because they were overheating for no reason with minimal use time. But I ended up returning my first pair and got another. My new AirPods don’t overheat and I use them often. The sound quality is great and they fit perfectly in my ear. The apple earbud design (as I understand it) is not a universal fit, so if you have tried the stock wired ones and they aren’t comfortable I wouldn’t buy these. The microphone is great, but they don’t noise cancel very well. Hey Siri and the touch sensor work great as well. The battery is great and the case has 24 hours of battery with a full charge. The AirPods have a 5 hour listen time and a 3 hour talk time with a full charge. Overall I would recommend this product. (if your pair overheats I suggest returning them)

So glad I bought them,Changed the way I listen. Great for working out. Not having to remove them if you have to walk away from your device has been sooo nice. I don't care how stupid people think they look haha,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Eh,"I was so excited to get these but am disappointed overall. The fit isn’t great and the AirPods pop right out of your ear. When they’re in for too long they can be painful and the design flaws aren’t conducive to prolonged use. The sound quality is relatively good for what it is but it doesn’t do much with background noise reduction. I like the fact that it syncs automatically with your phone and pauses music/YouTube if one of the AirPods is removed. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend these because they are not comfortable and I feel like they’ll get lost easily since they just pop out of your ear.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Expensive but worth the purcahse,"I bought these because I do a lot of off-the-floor shifts at my work, which means I can listen to my music while I work. I figured these would be much more convenient for this, so I caved and bought the airpods. And I gotta say, even though I personally do not care much for Apple, these things are fantastic. The sound quality is nearly perfect, great bass capabilities too, and they are honestly almost as good as the headset I use for my computer (Which is a corsair).

My only gripe is with the battery life on them. They die pretty quickly. They didn't last a 5.5-hour shift on at my work from a full charge when I started. Granted, they charge very quickly with the case. Mine went from about 8% to 98% in 23 minutes (I did time the charge). They also appear to just drain even when not in use, not at a fast pace but still. So you'd have to keep them in the charging case when not in use and the case also needs to be charged as well, not that I wasn't expecting this side effect. Aside from this small inconvenience, I have not had any issues with these and I'm very impressed with the quality.

They also fit as expected, don't fall out super easily, and are able to be used for phone calls better than the default mic my phone has.

I must applaud Apple for this one, they did a great job. I highly recommend them and I have no doubt Apple will take advantage of the success and keep developing and improving them.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Better Than I Expected!,"I wasn't sure how much I would use or like the AirPods Gen 2 when I first purchased but have really been pleasantly surprised by how often I reach for these over my old trusty wired ear buds.

Fit: I had no issues with fit; the Apple EarBuds always fit comfortably and snugly and these were no different.  I would say though that if the EarBuds didn't fit then the AirPods probably won't fit either.  I've seen some custom accessories to make more snug but imagine they wouldn't sit right in the charging case.

Connectivity: Apple has really made the bluetooth connection seamless which was always a tedious process on other wireless ear buds I've used. I just pop them in my ear and within seconds I hear the chirp that they're connected - huge plus.

Sound Quality: I would say the sound quality is better than good but not quite excellent.  I think there is room for improvement in that regard.  No interference or anything but the base isn't very deep.

Battery Life:  Again, I would say this is any area where it is better than good but not quite excellent.  On a full charge the case and buds will get me through about a day and a half before recharging but that is with relatively light usage. It is convenient that they are recharged with a lightning port as I have them everywhere now (work, car, office).

Overall, I would say I'm very happy with my purchase of the AiPods Gen 2.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

5 stars if they fit your ears,"I LOVED these headphones for what It was, but they don’t stay in my ears very well. If they did, it’d probably be a five star from me. When I’m walking around and not doing anything they stay in just fine, but I can’t workout in these and even a medium wind will make them feel like they need to be pushed back in constantly. I’d recommend trying them to see if they fit your ears and returning if they don’t. The other functions are great. Decent sound, tapping features for song skipping/Siri/play and pause, double as a mic, and best of all the convenient case that charges the AirPods when stored. Also I find the auto connect feature to apple products flawless, albeit beats have the same feature. If these fit you without falling out, then I would highly recommend. Otherwise, it’s not worth them constantly falling out.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Easy, pratical and light","I really like over the head, noise canceling headphones, but it gets pretty hot over the summer in LA, so I can't wear them as often as I would like.

The battery lasts a decent amount of time and the charging case is small enough that you can keep it in your pocket. They fit really well. They don't reproduce low frequencies as well as over the head headphones, but they don't sound bad at all. A great buy for non-audiophiles.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Airbuds are great,"These Apple Airpods are great for listening while you are active doing other things. I was reluctant to order the AirPods because I had doubts that they would stay in my ears. So far, that has not been a problem. I am still somewhat paranoid that one will fall out of my ear and I will fail to notice. That concern is somewhat reduced because if one should fall out, they both stop working. I ought to be able to notice that. Sound quality is not great, but good enough to wear while you're at the gym or merely walking around. Some degree of noise cancellation is achieved by the pods blocking the ear canal. I would not want active cancellation because I want awareness of what is happening around me. I haven't taken note of the battery life because I recharge the case after each use of the pods.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I love these Airpods!,"I had the first generation Airpods that I used for over 2 years, and unfortunately I lost them last month. What a bummer. I use them on a daily basis and can't live without them.

On the bright side, I get to buy the newest version of them as replacements. These new Airpods have the same look and feel, except they're faster to connect when I put them in my ears and they seem to be faster at skipping/pausing songs. I did notice that my old pair's battery life seemed to be decreasing. It's a nice relief to have a new pair that has a longer battery life. The sound quality seems a bit better too!",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I suspect other products exist that offer better value and can outperform these from a technical perspective, though I think the airpods are worth their price, they feel ""complete"" from top to bottom.

Can’t live without,"I always listen to my iPod as I’m doing my daily chores but there are a lot of times when my wired headphones get caught on things and rip them right off my head. My problem is I have tried wireless ear buds before and they tend to fall out of my ears. So I’ve never really given them a  chance. My son just got new AirPods and I liked them a lot. Since the only earbuds that stay in my ears are the Apple type wired ones, I figure that  since it’s really the same design I could probably use the wireless ones. I purchased them and I’ve been wearing them every day and I love them. A tap will turn on and off the sound pause and I can even ask Siri to raise or lower the volume. They’re completely customizable. They fit great and they stay in my ears no matter what I’m doing  and no wires to get hung up on items as I’m going about my daily business. The sound is amazing and I’m really enjoying them. The case charges itself and then when you put the earbuds in they automatically charge. What I really like about it is that the set up is so simple, once the item is paired it syncs as soon as you turn on your device. This is An awesome product. It’s pricey but it’s so worth it.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"(Latest model) is wrong, just FYI","The latest model when I bought this was a Gen 2 but I def got a Gen 1 set of airpods.  However, they were marked down quite a bit and that makes a ton of sense to me.  If you're expecting to get Generation 2 airpods for this much cheaper then you're going to be disappointed.  That being said the Gen 1s are perfectly fine and they work great.  They don't have any sort of noise-canceling so don't expect that to be a thing.  They do however sound pretty good and are very easy to use on a daily basis.  I use them all the time for listening to music or watching TV on my phone.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Headphones that work for all activities!,"Very happy with these headphones. For years I have been buying either knock off blue tooth headphones that either do not fit in my ears (they are small), stay in place during activity (such as running) and or are not compatable with my iphone. It is quite expensive, however worth it for wireless headphones that actually work for all of the above issues I had with previous headphones. The only downside is that occasionally the headphones  are slow or delayed to react to a song change (with the double tap) or will fall out easily if I hit them accidentally. Otherwise they do stay in place well, I am just an accident prone person. The case is also nice so I do not loose them (as this is often a problem for me, lol). I definitely recommend spending the extra $$ for these if you have an iphone.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

I wouldn’t recommend it for the price.,"I purchased a pair of these a few months and they aren’t worth the money.  They last about 4 hours but they charge really fast so that isn’t to bad. My biggest problem is with the controls. To play/pause, forward, back, and Siri you have to set it, and a double tap will activate it. However I usually only use one so I can only use one command at a time. The worst thing though is to turn them on it is just supposed to take putting them in your ear but after just a month one of them will only start working is I put the other one in first or SOMETIMES activate it manually. On top of that the same ear piece no longer works with the double tap so I can’t pause or play or answer a call or hang up with it.

To top it off they are easy to drop and lose if you are not careful. I haven’t lost them yet. All in all not with $170 maybe $100 just because they are Apple and they usually make good quality items.",2.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

A skeptic converted!,"Okay, so I bought these after my third pair of cheaper wireless headphones broke. I was getting tired of ones that attached and had the cord that went around my neck. Hence, I decided to search the internet for the best headphones that would work for listening to music/audio books while working out or doing things around the house. I finally decided to try out the AirPods since they had such great reviews, and because they were on sale. When I received the AirPods, I was surprised at how well they actually fit in my ears. I had worried about them falling out, and though they have fallen out a few times due to my children rough housing and landing on my head, they have worked great for walking around the house and exercising. The sound quality is really amazing, and I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly they charge.

One Size Does Not Fit All,"Given Apple’s price-quality continuum history, I had high expectations for this pricey set of earbuds. Out of the box and after fully charging, I was amazed at how fast they paired with my iPhone7. I have about 20 sets of earphones, ranging in price from the cheapo Monoprice to the Bose Sportsound. So, I put them in my ear canals and headed out for my 3-mile loop. I had expressed doubt that they would remain seated in my external auditory meatus while running. I had not gone 100m and the left one popped out and hit the pavement. This happened three more times before I was done. The right channel never moved. The sound quality was excellent. Not so great for excluding the ambient sound of passing cars. So, bottom line: great packaging. Long play life. Excellent sound in environments where ambient noise is around 80dB. If your ears are like mine, you’ll likely be picking one of them off the ground. The touch feature is great for taking phone calls. But, the Bose wins hands down for fit and exclusion of background noise. Plus, you have a fail-safe wire connecting both buds, a comforting thought when riding a bike.

"Easy to use, Reliable, Best Call Quality but ....","LOOKS:
-----------

This is either Love it or Hate it at first sight kind of design. Some do love the way it looks, but many still criticize it for the way it hangs outside of your ears.

The materials used are well thought for its application. The case is small, yet secure. Magnetic clasp for the lid and attachment for the pods themselves are top notch.

FIT:
-----

Another commonly debated topic about the AirPods is the FIT. Many do not find it secure. At best they are a loose fit. However, I have put this through the pace at Gym, and Daily life and it has never come off on its own unintended.

SETUP:
----------

Say it with me, ""1-2-3"". By the time you finish saying it, you are already connected and ready to go. Apple sets the benchmark for the Ease of setup and use. To the extent where Samsung has started mimicking the same process on their Galaxy Bud lineup.

BATTERY LIFE:
--------------------

Yet another benchmark. 5 hours of listening/talk time per charge is fantastic. Never ran out of juice at any given time during its use. If one ever does, 15 minutes of charge in the case gives you 3 hours of listening time.

In my experience, Apple has always downplayed the Battery Life. So in real life I got more than the stated times on the spec sheet.

CHARGING CASE:
--------------------------

Well pocketable and convenient. Charges fast, and keeps the Pods themselves charged. Simply does what it is designed to do; efficiently.

Easily scratched. Expect your blue jean colors to stick to it overtime. Needs regular cleaning to keep it pristine.

CALL QUALITY:
---------------------

Phenomenal. Terrific. The benchmark. With all the bluetooth earbuds that I've used, including dedicated Bluetooth headsets from the past and present; this one sounds the best when it comes to Microphone quality. The callers that I am talking to never suspected that I am using a headset. Its that good.

Stereo call playback is also a welcome bonus. The phone call sounds natural and true to life through this headset.

SOUND/AUDIO QUALITY:
-----------------------------------

The major drawback of the AirPods is its overall Audio quality. Although the sound quality is well above what is needed for a phone call, the overall Sonic quality is lacking for Music use.

Sound is open and vibrant, but lacks in Bass severely (No, I do not prefer too much bass; I seek balanced audio signature). Usually this is where I would go into detail about the sound signature as an audiophile. However, the product simply doesn't have the merits to warrant the time. If I were to keep it short and simple, the sound quality is ""Meh"". The EarPods that came packaged with your iPhone sounds very similar.

The open design of the AirPods also allows for the ambient noises to come through and diminish any very little bass that is present. GYM is a classic example where this headset fails (background music playing, various equipments chiming left and right). It lets every sound through as there is no isolation between the outside and your ear canal. You will be using higher volumes than you are used to with other headsets of this class.

PRICE:
---------

The asking price is a bit too much for what it offers. You may find other products in the market that offers more for the same money or less.

The audio signature is not that different than the 29 dollar (Free with your iPhone purchase) EarPods.

The difficult question to ask is, is it worth 160 dollars to just snip the cables off of your EarPods?
If the convenience means a ton to you, then Yes. But for many the answer will be a Hard NO.

VERDICT:
-----------

If you are an audiophile that expects higher fidelity out of your headsets, then the AirPods are not for you.

Although AirPods will not win wars with other headsets when it comes to sound quality, it sets the benchmark and performs terrific when it comes to everyday usage and reliability. The overall user experience outweighs the only poor aspect of the AirPods (Sound Quality).

Hence, If you are a novice user, you'll feel home with this product.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Airpod flex with convenience, good integration and a questionable price tag.","I got caught up with the hype/trend of the airpods. And there are good reason why it is popular. The first thing is the convenience of quickly and easily pairing with your phone or even computer. In terms of sound quality, the airpods doesn't sound at all different from the regular apple earpods. Essentially it is basically bluetooth earpods with the siri assistance built in. (both look the same/same size and everything). There is hardly any noise cancellation since its not that kind of headphone. The mic is okay but, I used it once and it sounds muddle when I tried it to record. One of the biggest plus using airpods is not having to deal with TANGLED WIRES. The airpods have great battery life and it charges really quick. I would say using airpods for around 4 hours leaves it around 70-80% on the airpods it self. Last thing to mention is the price tag, yes it is expensive but, If you're someone who wants no bells or whistle and want a good reliable product, and is okay with the price tag then go with this. Yes there are other headphones that offer more features and maybe even cheaper price. However, It is kind of hard to beat something this easy to use and part of the meme. So it is a great buy!",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Grandson is happy with the AirPods,"These were purchased for my grandson.  He likes them very much and I purchased the case for him to store them in for protection and safety.  He can clip them to his pant loop and go and know they are protected and safe.

My only concern is the music he chooses.  I pray he is listening to music that will edify and not influence him for wrong.  Music is powerful and has a great influence over all of us.  So much out there today I wouldn't want anyone to expose themselves to, but being a grand mother, it is not my responsibility to govern his ears and heart, but I pray for him.  Yes, I bought the AirPods.  He is going to listen regardless of how he listens.  Just hoping his heart is right and he will listen to music that edifies his spirit.  We should always remember Shadrack, Mechach and Abednigo.  When they heard the music they were to bow to the image.  Just sayin.  The AirPods are nice.  I would recommend them.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

APPLE WARRANTY IS A HOAX BUYERS BEWARE !!!,"I bought a pair of Apple air pods 2nd  generation from Walmart on 8/20/2019  just to return them with charging issues two days later for another pair of Air pods on 8/22/2019 .The reason for the purchase was to exercise with the lightest pods I could find . On 9/17/2019  for no apparent reason the air pods stop working , when you check the percentage level on your phone only the air pods will charge not the carrying  case the indicator light would not go past 46 %  .So I called customer support at Apple which set me up for a Apple in house appointment ,so I take the air pods  in and the tech looks in the hub where the pods charge and says '' You have moisture damage ,I can tell because its brown in the bottom of the capsule ''so I said ''if I would of known you couldn't wear them to work out because of moisture issues then I wouldn't of bought them '' he did not honor the warranty because of his visual inspection this took at least a hour ,I was told that he could sell me a new pair and that the other option was to go back to Walmart , so I went back to my local Walmart to the customer service and explain the situation with no question asked they took a q-tip cleaned out the bottom of the pod case and determined it didn't have moisture issues but that a little bit of dirt was covering  both terminals preventing it from charging properly and they also gave me a brand new air pod for my trouble .Now all Apple had to do was open up the case to see if the water damage came from me actually dropping it in a large amount of water and if the initial problem was from sweat then it should be covered but not them there techs are money hungry and they just want you to spend more and more they don't care  .Please don't fall victim to Apple .

I wish I'd bought them sooner--Very useful for persons with hearing issues,"These are COOL!  This is truly something I wish I'd purchased months ago.

They are easy to set up, just flip open case and they connect.  Not sure how long one charge lasts--haven't used them long term.  Seem pretty secure and mostly stay in place, but get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. (I think they're a bit too big for my ears.)  Sound quality is wonderful.  I have hearing aids that are supposed to be able to allow me to listen to music and calls on my iPhone, but sound quality is awful, so I never used either feature.  The first time I got an incoming call with these in place, I was surprised and pleased by how easy it was to fully understand the call without having to switch to speaker phone.

I plan to try using my phone in meetings as a way of streaming other's voices directly into my ears.  I will be really nice to not miss half of what others say, or to get whiplash from turning my head back & forth to look at whomever is speaking as I try to read their lips.  I understand that it's possible to put the phone in front of a TV and have it relay the sound directly to the Air Pods.  I currently don't need to do that because I can just pair them with the Roku app on my phone, but will try it out when visiting family to see if it will allow me to hear the TV better.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"AirPod 2 pods, Non-wireless Charger. Still an awesome product!","I’d like to mention some things to clear up confusion for some.
The pods are AirPods 2 models with models A2032/2031 imprinted on the underside of each pod respectfully. Also when saying “Hey Siri,” the pods will wait for next response vs. the AirPods 1 where you’d have to set a double tap action to activate it.
The charging case on the other hand is the regular lightning charging case without wireless charging as there is no light in the front to indicate wireless charging. This is indicated on the product details as it should and is correct. I personally do not thing the wireless charger is worth it unless you already have a wireless charging pad laying around so the regular will do.
Overall, sound quality is great and clear.
Battery lasts fairly long and are worth getting if you can get them for a cheaper price.
I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them. You will definitely see me in the AirPods Pro once my original AirPods die and they became cheaper.

Disappointed,"First, I would like to say that these are comfortable and the sound quality is decent.

Not lets get to the root of the problem. The battery life on these SUCK! I can put them in my ear fully charged, and an hour later they die. It's kind of a pain when you're talking to somebody and then you have to switch to your phone and ask what they just said because you missed it.

If you don't use your phone much, these are nice, but I'm on the phone a lot for work and these are just very disappointing to me.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Total junk and waste of money,"My daughter saved for months to buy these in July. As of yesterday, they don’t even work.  You’d think for nearly $200 they’d last longer than 3 months.

Very poor quality.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Overall fantastic,"I bought these mainly for calls. The sound quality is great and they’re very convenient.  I might wear them a could hours in a row for calls and not even notice. The charge lasts for hours.

I wear them to listen to music while flying as well. They’re not noise canceling but suit my purposes just fine.  I don't hear normal cabin noises while wearing them.

However, they don’t stay in my ears as well as some people report.  I couldn’t use these while being active for instance. I’ve already chased one that fell out and rolled down a plane aisle.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Overall, I really like these, I am pretty picky when it comes to audio and sound quality and these are not going to impress certain people, but they don’t sound bad and I think most people will love the sound. These are a great second gen product, I hope Apple could add some noise isolation while keeping the comfort on the next generation to make these the perfect true wireless earbuds.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Great headphones!,"I really-really like them!!! I was dropping my iPhone pretty regularly (and, therefore, had to send it to Apple for an out-of-warranty battery replacement couple of times) because headphone wires kept getting somewhere (cabinet knobs and handles most of the times). So my wife decided to get me wireless ones. And these ones rock!

* Sound quality has definitely improved. I'm sure Apple has a smart explanation for that  but all I can say is yes, I hear that the sound is better in these headphones than in regular (wired) ones.
* Noise cancellation definitely works - I have to remove one of the headphones to hear someone.
* Cool feature: when you remove one of the headphones from your ear, the video/music you're currently watching/listening to is paused!!!! Can you believe this??? But wait! There is more! When you put that headphone back in, that video/music is resumed!!!  magic!
* Battery life is good/excellent (I'd rate it 4.5 out of 5). It is definitely not outstanding/fantastic/mind-blowing but it is pretty darn good for the size.

Most Versatile Earbuds I've Owned,"Background -
I've used a variety of inexpensive wired earbuds in the past. In the past five years I've started to try bluetooth earbuds for everyday use and then two years ago I upgraded to PowerBeats 2. It was a big leap for me. They were great for exercise and the battery life was long but the call quality and awkwardness of using sports earbuds around town made me reserve them for workouts.

Review -
I wasn't sure if I should upgrade to the newest Airpods when they were announced. They did not seem like much of an improvement over what I currently have. Ultimately, they proved to be versatile enough to be my EDC and replace all of the other earbuds I had. For workouts, there is less wind noise than the beats. For calls, the sound quality is great. Connection is quick. The battery life is a little low, but the charging case mediates it, as does the ability to use one ear at a time and then swap. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I don't look silly in the office with one of them in. When they were first released they were enough of a novelty that they stood out, but the heavy adoption has made the little white sticks in our ears a common sight.

So, for music, business calls, exercise, or even just to engage siri, the new Airpods are a great choice. Just be careful when you handle the case so you don't drop it, since it is pretty slick.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Very Average Headphones.,"Terrible headphones. Apple does a great with their marketing getting the consumer to believe these headphones are better than what they are. For one they are not noise cancelling. Secondly the headphones literally have the same sound quality as the plug-in version. The H1 chip helps to pair faster and the Siri is a nice upgrade but there are better true wireless options around the same price that has much better quality for the price.

Glad I bought these,"I have been searching for wireless earbuds for a good amount of time and surprisingly I am really satisfied with my purchase. (My phone is an iPhone 6 Plus roughly 4 years old)

Things I was looking for in wireless earbuds
-sound quality
-fast connectivity
-battery life
-sound quality when making phone calls/mic sound
All of these were fulfilled when I tried it out.

I was really surprised on how fast the airpods connect and how I can easily tell that they are on. It makes a sound when you put them in your ear. I don't have to check my phone to see if they are connected or not. I do not need a specific app to control the sound quality like other wireless earbuds. I was also surprised on how easy it was to check the battery life of both the case and the earbuds. Just have to open the case and see the screen and the battery life will show up on the bottom of the screen. Some earbuds do not have the greatest mic when making phone calls. You will not come across problems like that when using these airpods. Battery life lasts a good amount for me. I usually only use one out of the two airpods, when one of them starts going low in battery i just switch over to the other airpod. There is no struggle in trying to reconnect with the airpods just have to pop them in your ear. Also if the airpods are low in battery it does fast charge when you put them in the case so it will easily charge half way within 15 or so minutes. No sound leaks as well when using them even if your music is really loud.

Overall A+++ purchase. Would recommend to anyone looking for wireless earbuds.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Still not up to the level of quality one would expect from a $140 pair of earbuds.,"I am comparing these to my ~$40 SoundPEATs Q29 model i bought 2-3 years ago.  Its almost as the the pros and cons for these two competing earbuds are reversed.
Apple AirPod PROS:
Battery Life: ~5 hrs listening time. And the case holds charge for, i don't even know how many charges. I haven't counted but its significantly higher than the SoundPEATS.
Ease of Charging: SO SIMPLE. The magnet inside secures the airpods to the charging electrodes. The soundpeats lose their connection to the electrodes constantly so it never fully charges either earbud. I would have to constantly twerk and manipulate the buds in the case to make them charge.
Ease of Connecting: The chip helps them connect without any problems.
Audio Latency while watching video: NONE!!
Custimization: Really like that you can customize the controls for either right or left AirPod. However, would like, more gestures I'd like to customize. Like, instead of just a 2 tap, also have a 3-tap. That way you can customize 4 controls. I'd really like to be able to repeat a song, or turn up and down the volume.

Apple AirPod MEHS:
Audio Quality: Just a little better than the SoundPEATs... not much but it is noticeable.

Apple AirPod CONS:
Connectivity: Because of the Apple's forced upgrading, we can't use these on devices running anything before iOS10. That means I can't connect to my First Gen iPad. (the thing is still chugging along and great for streaming NetFlix, Hulu, and Videos.
Comfort: The SoundPEATs were super comfortable and fit snuggly in the ear. The shape of the AirPods bothers my earholes. I even purchased some vinyl condoms with earplugs to cover it up. It makes it more comfortable, but its still noticeably more uncomfortable. Also, those vinyl covers don't allow the AirPods to fit in the case, so I have to remove them all the time.... which isn't too bad since I ended having to do that with the SoundPEATS because I couldn't get them to charge properly with the earbud cushion? on.
Look/Style: The AirPods look dumb as hell. The SoundPEATs are small and round and fit right in the ear and don't have a white wang hanging down over your earlobe.
Dropped Connection/Choppy Audio: Ok. Here I was thinking that the AirPods would correct this issue with the SoundPEATs. When I'm oustide working in the yard, audio was choppy regardless if the phone was 10 feet away or in my pocket. Nothing I did seemed to correct it. It was like this with the SoundPEATS. I THOUGHT that the chip in the AirPods would keep this from happening. NOPE. SAME PROBLEM PERSISTED and was made worse by the fact that they were 3.5x more expensive!!!!!  Work fine in doors and while I'm at work in the lab. Must be some sort of interference outside. But really, Come on. Its 2019. GET IT TOGETHER.
Exterior Audio: UGH The AirPods fail spectacularly here. Not only do they get choppy while I'm out doing yard work, but because they don't have a rubber tip that seals up the ear canal like the SoundPEATs, that means I get to hear the FULL sound of my lawnmower and weedwacker and it drowns out my jams. And also my nagging boss at work and rando plebians i come across in my travels. Also this means they will be practically useless on an airplane. The SoundPEATs helped block out the engine drone and crying and shouting babies, children, and MAGA douchenozzles.

Overall, I like them enough to keep using them for regular use but I will need to go back to my SoundPeats for airplane travel and yardwork. Son of a....",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

You NEED to read this..,"So to kick this off, let me relate to you. Whenever these came out my very first thought was, what an absolute waste of money. Who would dare spend this obnoxious amount of money for these little buds?? Now I’ve had them for three days. I was that obnoxious guy. Now let me explain how my life has changed.

Day one of me having the AirPod 2s :
I have realized what peace is. I walk outside and no longer hear birds cawing at me, but I hear the sweet rhythm of Mac Miller.
I went to a restaurant, and only told them what I wanted. No awko taco convo. Just here’s the drink, here’s the food, please bring it to me while I listen to my Beethoven. Awkward choice for Applebee’s but I digress. Day one and my life has already improved for the better.

Day Two:
I went for a run today. I don’t run. But with these AirPod 2s and the motivating voice of Rick Ross I pushed out 3 miles. Then I get home to find out that I, a simple nobody two days ago, have now received a top fan badge on Facebook! Moment later I had a phone call with Matthew McConaughey to discuss my top fan privileges and my future. I still cannot believe how much my life has changed at this point. All because these Air Pods have lifted my spirits with the sweet sounds of my Spotify playlists on the go!

Day Three:
I now feel as though nothing can stop me. Today I woke up, put my pods in, and played some AC/DC while playing Call of Duty. I got a 40 KD Ratio each game that I played. I never got above .50 until today. I feel as though when I put these tiny buds in my ears I’m similar to Bradley Cooper in Limitless. Like the world is mine, I know what to do and I do it. If you haven’t bought these yet, please, just take the leap. Experience life in a new flavor. Even if you return them a week later (which I doubt you’ll do) just feel what life can be with these beautifully designed AirPods.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Buyer Beware,"The product is fine, but I was under the impression I was ordering a NEW product at the discounted, sale price ($144).  This was not the case it turns out, because when we connected the iPhone through Bluetooth, they came up as ""Ja...'s"" airpods.  I contacted Amazon Prime Customer service and the only option offered was to return for a full refund.  Since these were a gift, I asked if I could exchange for the new ones at same price (as advertised originally); but this was not an option.  Since the product seems to be working fine, we have chosen to keep them.  Just wanted it known as a buyer to BE SURE that the item you are ordering states NEW, if that is what you are wanting.",3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Convenient,"I bought an AirPods for my friend’s birthday, and he told me he really like it. So bought one for myself, but because my ears are smaller than normal, it falls off easily.

Overall, I would recommend this product.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Hey Buds,"Well, I'm pretty shocked.

I can't believe how many features they were able to pump in these two little ear plugs!

First off they are blue tooth, so completely wireless and sync extremely easily with the phone. No worries about running outside and accidentally unplugging your headphone when blading your hands T1000 style as you chase after vehicles, or sending your phone tumbling onto the treadmill to them be launched into another gym patron!

So yeah, blue tooth, definately a great start. However you can also answer the phone just by tapping one earphone. I haven't tested the max range but so far I can be yards away from my phone and tap the bud and it picks up. It also has great sound and I've been told that I can be heard clearly as well without having to stick the earbud in my mouth like with traditional headphone mics. Then when I'm done with a call I just tap the opposite headphone and Bam! Done!

I'm still playing around with them, but for just starting I'm mightily impressed!

The buds also are able to cycle through music if you tap them. Even better you can adjust the bud tap settings!",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Is the left one supposed to die after 3 months?!?!,So first off I wanna say I do love these AirPods. But... I have only had mine less then 3 months and the left one has totally stopped working. The case and my phone won’t even recognize that a left one even exists. And the case seems to loose all its charge very fast. All things that should not be happening form a apple product only 3 months old. It has got very frustrating since I use them for work. If it wasn’t for all that I would have given a much higher rating. I plan on talking to amazon and apple. Something has to be done about this! I looked thew the other reviews and this is not the first case of ether of these issues. I will update this once I have a chance to talk to them.,1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Broken within 4 days and lax customer service,"I got these just under two weeks ago, and I'm not going to lie, the AirPods truly are revolutionizing the Bluetooth headphones game. However, 4 days after receiving them, the right AirPod stopped working without me doing anything to it. After having numerous chats with customer service and 3 phone calls, I was promised a replacement. Currently, I'm still waiting for them to be shipped and I'm not impressed with Apple customer service. After calling Apple Support, the customer service senior told me ""it's only been 4 days since they were supposed to be shipped"". 4 days may not seem long to ship a new pair of AirPods, but you don't say that to 6-year Apple customer, not to mention that I spent over $150 on a new product that breaks almost instantly.

Design flaw - be aware of the one-year warranty period,"Many reviews note that eventually one or both ear buds will eventually fail. It appears that the batteries have a life span issue. My right ear bud starting having issues with receiving a full charge after 9-12 months. It failed completely by 18 months. Apple does not have any sort of repair/replacement program for parts on these devices, so the only option is to buy a new set.

Buds Don't Always Work,"When these work they are awesome, but most of the time the right bud does not work. For a while I could get the right one to work by putting it back in the case for a few seconds, then putting it back in my ear, but that stopped working recently. Now I have to completely reset them every time to make sure I have sound on the right side, and even that isn't a guarantee. If I even pause my music, it can make the right bud stop working. The other day, the right bud had 0% charge even though they both had been in the case all day and the case still had more than 50% charge left. I've also been surprised at how quickly these lose charge when they do work. If you decide to get them, make sure to return them as soon as you start having issues otherwise you'll be stuck with a faulty product and out $150.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Left headphone stopped working in under 10 uses,"I actually really like airpods but this is totally unacceptable quality control. It seems every time I go to use them I have to re-pair them with my phone because the left airpod is not working for whatever reason. Today upon trying to fix them I am now receiving a red exclamation mark, even after re-pairing and re-setting several times and checking the bottom of the pod and the case for debris or damage.

I didn't pay $200 for headphones that are going to quit working after 10 uses. No one would pay $20/use no matter how much they like the experience when it actually works.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Airpods are great for convenience,The sound is alright but the product is overpriced if you want better sound and better noise cancellation you’ll be able to find bettering products. Though the airpods are mostly used for convenience and they are great to just take out of your pockets and put in. If you’re looking for wireless earbuds that have a great battery life and are able to just put in and take anywhere the airpods will do the job.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Decent Product,"Under the basic criteria of sound quality, noise cancelation, and battery life I would give the latest airpods a 4 out of 5. The sound quality I would say is 4 out of 5. Noise cancelation I would say is a 3 out of 5. The battery life is pretty decent so I will give the battery life a 4 out of 5. The strength of the apple airpods is definitely the sound quality of the music. The airpods weakest flaw is its noise cancelation features.",4.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Very glitchy,These can be very glitchy when all Bluetooth is connected such as Apple Watch and connected to your car along with AirPods . Also I’ve noticed very poor quality if my phone is connected to WiFi . These aren’t what I expected and I don’t think they are worth the money . They have a great battery life just wish they worked better . Also the phone call quality can also be staticky,3.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

"Stopped working after a week, Apple gave us a hard time about exchanging them","We bought a brand new set of AirPods for $159. After using them for a week, I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead. I figured, maybe I just need to charge them. So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead. So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldn't reconnect them to my phone at all.

Once I contacted Apple, they tried to give us the run around. They wanted us to let them fully die, which makes sense, so we did that. Then, when they still didn't work we wanted to exchange the faulty pair for a new set (BECAUSE WE PAID 159 DOLLARS AND ONLY USED THEM FOR A WEEK). Keep in mind, they were taken care of, not dropped, no water damage, they were expensive so they were treated delicately.  Apple wanted a $180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR.

I decided to contact Amazon, and they suggested contacting Apple, but once I explained what was going, on Amazon offered to make things right and send out a replacement. Never had an issue with Amazon's customer service, but Apple was extremely disappointing. I won't purchase these again.",1.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Perfect Pods!,"I was skeptical about ordering these after reading some of the bad reviews on here. But, I received my pair perfectly packaged and sealed just as you would get at the store. Both pods were clean, no sign of them being used. When connecting to my phone, it said my name and not someone else’s. The sound sounds great, as well. Battery does last along time. Overall, I’m very pleased and would recommend them.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Improved Over 1st Gen (regardless of what some here are saying),"Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen.  This is misleading and inaccurate.  Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn’t anecdotal.  It’s been tested and proven to be faster.

Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you’ll save a few dollars.

If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade.  If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model

Even as a PC person I enjoyed these.,"Let me start by saying I don’t like apple products typically and I think their marketing, product cycles and etc are not great.
My feelings on the company aside, this product is genuinely very good. It has a long battery life, the charging case is well made and the earbuds click in and top closes with magnets so they don’t fall out or get lost easily. The case also serves as a portable battery pack for the headphones and it can be recharged with a standard iPhone charger. The headphones detects when you pull them out of your ears and pauses whatever you’re listening to and restarts when you put them back in and automatically connects to your phone. The noise cancelation isn’t so much I feature I look for but at medium to louder volumes you can’t hear things around you but at quiter volumes you can hear everything around you if that makes any difference. I normally don’t like iPhone headphones in general because they’re a bit big and don’t fit comfortably but these fit perfectly plus they’re small and inconspicuous.
I bought a ton of other headphones but they all died, broke or were a pain to connect or charge.
These headphones were overly expensive but they are better in every way and I fully recommend them.",5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
Not worth it gurl,They are cute. I only got them because everybody else had them and I didn’t want to seem broke. But for $157 it’s not worth it. They aren’t noise canceling & they don’t get that loud. I mean like DEF I want my music LOUD! But they were ok. I wouldn’t suggest them to anybody tho. But I mean they are good & cool.,5.0,Apple Airpods-Latest Model
