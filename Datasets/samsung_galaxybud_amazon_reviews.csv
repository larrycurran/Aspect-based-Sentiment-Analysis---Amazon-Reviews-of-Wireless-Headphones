The volume is very soft. I have mine on max all the time and if a soft video or song comes on I can't hear it. The worst thing that makes it unusable is the Bluetooth. They lose contact if any part of my body comes between my phone and it. I was mowing the lawn and realized that every time my leg passed under my arm the music cut out which is really annoying. Also if you eat with these in, they fall out immediately. Sad because they could have had a really good product but failed at some of the most basic things you need. I pretty much use these to workout now. For 100+ dollars I would be really angry if I bought these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_273?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=273&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just didn't trust the tech yet, or everything was way over priced. These are a decent price and are fantastic. They are not huge buds that stick out of your head making you look...special; and they are not like those small white ones that drip down and can only be held in place by ear wax. These have small rubber rims that hold them in place very well.

The sound quality is better than I was expecting. They are wireless, so you'll never get the quality of the regular overhead headphones, but they are as good as, or better than many wired earbuds I've used.

They connect to multiple devices without issue, which makes me so unbelievably happy! I can use these with my cell phone as well as my music device and it only takes seconds to switch back and forth.

I was a little put off by how easy it is to activate the touch controls - every time I stuck them in my ears or took them out, I turned on or off whatever I wanted to/had been listening to. But I have actually gotten used to this and now know how to put in and take them out without activating anything.

I've done a few calls with these as well and they are great. No issues with sound (from either end) or connection. They work better than anything else I've used in the past.

The wireless charger and charging are fantastic. I've never had them run out of battery, even though I use them most of the day at work to keep out office sounds. I don't know how many hours I use them, but maybe between 3 and 4? I've yet to run out of battery with regular daily use.

If you've been on the sidelines, unsure about buying wireless earbuds because of price or quality, these are (so far) a great product to get you started. I'm very pleased with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've previously owned the jaybird x2's and jaybird freedom but these are my go-to headphones for working out! They fit well and dont fall out of the ear even during sternous exercises. They include different sizes of ear tips to ensure a proper fit for most ears. Connectivity was simple! If you have a newer samsung phone, all you need to do is flip the lid open to the galaxy bud case and the phone detects them itself and asks if youd like to connect. If you have an Apple phone, you have to go in to your settings and manually pair the ear buds after opening the case. The best part is, you can choose to use only 1 earbud at a time! The sound quality is good after being tweaked using Samsung's equalizer. So far, I haven't needed to charge my buds as the case charges them back to 100% everytime I put them in. All in all I think these are a step above the icon X buds. These were given to me at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Like random times when it takes a few attempts to sync with the phone but this may only happen once out of a hundred uses. Also, sometimes the quality of my voice seems to make people have a hard time hearing me but this is only when I am in a noisy environment so take that as you will. Besides that, these offer an awesome sound that provide amazing noice canceling that I have not experienced before with in ear headphones. From mowing the lawn to vacuuming inside the house, I could barely hear either noise when using these. You also have the feature to allow ambient noise to hear your surroundings while enjoying these headphones which was a nice plus when you're jogging or are in an area where hearing your surroundings is important.

Then a year or two later S9 came out and that was better, then S10. for many years.  Then other various models, my last one were the Jaybird X3.  They all fit in ear, but were connected by wires that wrapped around your head.

What I always wanted and yearned for were small wireless buds that you can just put in your ears and have powerful sound.  And I'd say these galaxy buds are equivalent in sound to Jaybird X3.  I want the buds discreet.  And we have them with the galaxy buds.  While Apple may have been in the right direction, with two pods directly in ears with no wires, that tampon string looking thing sticking out is a dealbreaker.  (Yeah I know there have been higher priced or lower priced buds out for years.)  But I like the small size and the price of the galaxy buds, the $130 price is the same I paid for my Jaybird X3 last year.

I don't think you could wear both buds all the time, because you could have problems hearing people.  It's too good in blocking out outside noise and the ambient sound feature does amplify sounds, but too much as you can hear the ruffling of your clothes, and voices seem computerized.  So I just have wear one earbud all the time and leave the other one in my pocket when I'm not listening to music.

Hopefully Samsung version two will just get better, maybe 10 percent smaller, and peach color to be even more discreet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are comfortable and I didn't have to change the tips or wings because out of the box it was perfect!

Like every new product there will be some issues. I have seen some issues with music cutting out here or thier for a slight second and it fixes it self. Samsung did just update them today which seems to have fixed Bluetooth issues but just know Samsung is working on fixing any issues we have with these.

This does feature ambient sound which is an awesome feature that just lacks a bit. I feel after a few updates this will be amazing and one of the best features!

Call quality on these have been good but have noticed slight cutting out every once in a while but could be due to service and we're I'm located. The people on the other end can hear me perfectly in door and out so that's always good.

I also use the Buds with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet.  When comparing the two, the Jabra has better Base when playing music and the sound quality for calls are so much greater.  The Galaxy Buds on the other hand has better Mids and depending on what songs you are playing the Base can be pretty good.  Other things I like about the Buds are it's quick-connect to my Note 8 as soon as I take it out of the case as well as it's disconnect once you take it out of your ear.  Also, the touch features to answer/hang up call, plus navigate through music selection and changing the volume.  If you turn the volume to about midway, then you get a sense of noise cancelling, but it's really just that you have the volume up to a point that you can hear anything else.  The battery life is okay compared to others and the call quality could use some more updates to improve it.

Overall, I really like and enjoy using the Buds.  From time to time I still use the Jabra Elite, but 90 percent of the time the Buds are my go to listening earbuds.  I would recommend the Galaxy Buds to anyone that has a compatible Samsung phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_226?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=226&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are extremely light and comfortable regardless of how many times you take them out and put them back in your ears.  The sound is great/good. The connection is distance is great and so is the size and look in public. The only 2 issues which i experience a couple times a day is first it gets some kind of interference as if your connection breaking up even tho its in your pocket.

However, for the best sound quality, by my sound engineering experience, there is 3.5 mm out jack needed, and a good HiFi wired headphones such as B&O, Bose, or Sony :D if a you need to perform some simple sound engineering tricks using a smartphone :D
As for wireless buds, they have very good sound quality, good job Samasung.
While waiting my new galaxy from Samsung, I paired the buds with my LG V20!  LG V20 does not recognize Galaxy buds as a HiFi device (analog out B&O Play certified in V20 built for wired out only.. ) , but the installed galaxy buds plugin from Samsung does very good job - just needed to play with its settings.
I increased the sound volume to max in the buds, while in in my phone, the Bluetooth sound usually set <= to 60-70% - this gives better bass quality and very nice reach sound.

If I had actually paid for these, I would have returned them.

I have been using these earbuds almost everyday since I got them in April 2019. I generally use them while sitting at my desk without issue. If I start moving around, its another story. I can not move between floors (up or down) without losing connection/sound cutting out consistently. I can not walk down the street with my phone in my purse or my pocket (neither front nor back) without the sound cutting out consistently. Anytime I need to touch the earbud to adjust its position, the music pauses. This is because the earbuds themselves are touch screen and a single tap will pause or play the music. This feature is too sensitive when you're not intending to use it, and completely impossible to use when desired. You are also supposed to be able to skip or replay a song with double taps etc. but these features do not work consistently. I would prefer no touchscreen abilities at all, since I have to adjust them A LOT - these tend to slip and fall out of my ear (not constantly, but often).

The best thing about these earbuds is that they are comfortable (unlike the hard plastic air pods) and have adjustable sizes to accommodate a wider variety of users. They also don't look as awkward/goofy as air pods, they're more discrete. I mainly wanted these because of their function and reputable name brand. I am definitely disappointed since they barely function. I expected a lot more from Samsung & for this price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These earbuds are really good. Like REALLY good. The sound quality is great and those that are disappointed probably got a pair that had issues. Most new technology does so looking up reviews ahead of time and what’s been recalled can save you a lot of time and money. That being said they do sound great. The fit is really good as well. Snug in the ear and nothing to big or bulky jutting out from the side of your head. The call quality is a bit lack luster but I mean if you’re buying these for phone calls you’re buying them for the wrong reason. Here is the biggest issue with these. They are Samsung buds so they work best with Samsung products. Using with an iPhone or a google pixel phone will cause major degradation of sound, call and voice quality and you will experience latency issues. That thing where you watch a video and the sound is off from the people’s lips moving. So if you’re listening to music or podcasts it’s fine but for videos or movies it’s gonna lag, and lag hard.

I didn't select the IconX because I am not wearing these at the gym for any cardio workouts. I only use the machines at a slow pace and my Bose over-the-ear were getting too sweaty. I also wear these for everything around the house and at work.
The sound output is really flat so I use the EQ with bass and sound boost. The output is not really loud so these are not good for working in a factory or mowing lawns. Also, If you add a 3rd party EQ, it will cause all kinds of issues at least with the Samsung Note 9. I suspect Galaxy Wear with it's own sound processing doesn't play well with other sound processing apps.
The ambient sound switch allows outside noise to amplified to hear things like other speaking if at the office. You can adjust the level to drown out the annoying people 10' away and only hear the person speaking to you.
The range is really good at least with a good charge. I believe the negative issues others have experienced with distance issues is due to a weak battery. Note rechargeable batteries have around 450 cycles before they loose 1/2 their capacity.
These are great earbuds but are not for every type of application.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the box, is just how small they are. I've used wireless buds in the past, and they have always been bulky full of lights and gimmicks and brand logos and such. These are sleek black without a trace of excess. They blend right in to your style without standing out at all and that is exactly what I'm looking for.

The Sound
I have used cheaper wireless buds in the past, both from Sony and JLabs, and while those sound decent enough, these definitely blew them out of the water. The clarity and volume on these is fantastic. And paired with the equalizer settings, you can definitely really enjoy your music the way that you want. While they don't offer any active noise cancellation, they definitely fit well enough where they don't really require it. Sitting in a loud coffee shop isn't really a problem even at not so loud volumes.

The Look
As I mentioned, these are tiny and super sleek. All black all around with nary a trace of excess. They blend into your outfit, as any good technology should. You forget that they are there pretty much. But when you need them, they are a tap away.

Touch controls
It took maybe 10 minutes to get the touch controls to become intuitive. The touchpad gives you access to all of the controls pretty much, plus a programmable option for each earbud. The quick ambient sound option is by far the most useful for me, in which holding down on an earpad lowers the volume of your music temporarily and enhances the sound around you to better hear what is going on.

Overall
Coming from wired buds for most of my life, to more recently cheaper wireless buds, the Galaxy Buds are so far my favorite. And not just from a sound quality perspective, which is important obviously, but also from a usability and style perspective. I don't feel awkward wearing these and I'm not struggling to change a track or to pause my music. And they stay in place super well. When you first put them, you feel like maybe they won't stay in as they are so small. But an hour later, they haven't budged, even after heavy movement, such as the gym. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a decently priced and high quality audio experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My 1st pair of wireless buds. Let me start with the positive. 1st I have 2 galaxy watches and a Samsung phone. So easy to pair. The minute I opened the case they started to pair with phone.  I got these because in Georgia we have a hands free law so i wanted something without wires hanging.  It took a bit to get the right size for my tiny ear but Samsung gave me 3 options in the box with 3 sizes of wings. That was a plus. When I listen to my audio book the volume is great and when I listen to music it's great too. The downfall starts here. I can not get the volume up loud enough when I get a call. They can hear me but I cannot hear them. It sounds like a low whisper. I have tried a couple of things but to no avail. I can be listening to my book volume great while listening to my book and get a call volume drops to a whisper. When I'm finished with call the volume goes back up! So disappointed in these.

I don't have much prior experience with ""true"" wireless earbuds, but have owned a variety of mid-range wired headphones and earbuds and care about sound quality. I was impressed with the sound and fit, the touch controls are finicky, though generally I was most disappointed with the connection quality with my Pixel 2. Basically if I kept the phone in my pocket one of the earbuds would usually drop in and out, or they would get out a sync. They released a bunch of firmware updates all addressing connectivity, and it improved but still wasn't great. Overall it was usable, but just sort of annoying.

A few weeks ago I was using them at the gym on the treadmill and the left bud just stopped working entirely. Other than some sweat, I have never dropped or gotten the buds wet or anything. I contacted Samsung to do a warranty RMA as Samsung has a 1 year warranty. I spent a lot of time (3+ hours on chat and phone) working with Samsung support to try to be approved for an RMA, but they refused to approve it. I had the buds in the charging case, and the original box it came in, all accessories and documentation, a proof of purchase barcode from the retail box, and order emails and invoices from AT&T. Given all that, Samsung still refused to even create an RMA ticket as they required a serial number, and the only place the serial number is printed is in faint lettering on the bottom of the earbuds which had worn off in my pocket. Seriously, the serial number is very hard to read on BRAND NEW case, and handling them in your hand or in your pocket or in your gym bag, it will quickly become illegible. Samsung was just useless in this, though I am sure the agents were trying, they just refused to do anything without that serial number. Thankfully after talking with AT&T on the phone, they said to just take the buds into an official AT&T store. I was able to do this, and AT&T swapped them out with minimal questions (They at first said I should go through the manufacturer directly, but they have a policy in place where they replace anything for the first year which is awesome).

Finally, its worth noting that my newer buds, while indistinguishable from my old set, seem to have slightly better connectivity. You can still get drops if you cover the phone with your hand but they seem much more reliable from my normal use case which is the phone in my pocket. Not sure if its just slightly newer hardware or they changed something, but it is definitely a bit better. I probably would give these 4-5 stars, but with the reliability and customer support issues I really can't recommend them when there appears to be other options out there.

TL;DR If you buy these, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A PHOTO OF THE BACK OF THE CHARGING CASE and record the serial number! You will need these to do an RMA with Samsung!

The buds will work fine indoors, but as soon as I use them outdoors, well I can't. If I have my phone in my pocket, every step they will cut out which makes them unusable. Not sure what the issue is, but it seems to be a common problem. It's now to the point that even if my phone is in my hand they will still cut out. My cheap $20 earbuds worked better than these.

Nice design, small and simple. That's where the good ended for me. The Galaxy Buds worked fine on my Galaxy 9+ when I used them indoors; however, if I walked outside with them the buds would begin to stutter and the connection would go in and out. I took every step I could find online to fix the issue. I spoke with Samsung customer service; more solutions other than to exchange the items. I called Verizon and spent an hour and half with their support and ended up changing my phone for another Galaxy 9+ under the assumption the problem was my phone. Got the new phone... same problems. I then exchanged the Galaxy Buds through Amazon. Got the new Galaxy Buds today... and well the new buds don't work either. My other bluetooth earbuds work fine. I returned the Galaxy Buds today for a refund. There seems to be a problem with the Galaxy Bud design. Either way I was very disappointed my experience with these earbuds. I've heard that because of the size of the buds, there's a lot of interference going through my pants pocket and through me to the buds. Well, I bought a cheaper pair of bluetooth earbuds, of similar size, that work perfectly on the first pair. Compared to the two Galaxy Buds I tried. Plus you would think that the assumption would be that a person would carry their phone in their pocket or a some bag(either purse of satchel) not inches from their head; otherwise, it's just using your phone as normal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used to have the Bose Soundsport, but they were just too big for me. The wing tips that they use are great, but the actual molded bit under the silicone was just too big for my little ears.

The Samsung Galaxy Buds however are awesome. With the smallest size covers, and medium wing tips they fit snuggly into my ear canal with a nice seal. They offer mild noise impedence, but also an ambient noise setting too if you want to wear them somewhere you need to be aware of your surroundings. Mostly though, I just can't get over how SMALL they are! The case is really pocketable and I love that it charges with a usb-c cable or wireless if you have a wireless charger.

I'm still getting used to the touch gestures to control the Buds, but they're very intuitive. I'm sure I'll get the hang of them soon.

As a galaxy s10e user I have no choice this is the Best option but at a cost. Battery life is meh gets you through the day, sound quality is flat and bass is poor. The tap features are a hit or miss mostly with the triple tap to go back to the previous track, if you press it to fast it will skip or pause, if you tap to slow it will skip or pause you would have to be a human metronome to get it right. The biggest disappointment is the microphone. ABSOLUTE TRASH!! your voice is inaudible over the phone and if you want hear your surroundings just take the earbuds off, you wont regret going the extra step that you didn't have to do if it was better. I also have the airpods 2 and I have done the comparison, sound quality the airpods win with a good balance of highs, mids and and acceptable standard of bass but just with ambient sound permanently on because of its design. The case has wireless charging and the pill design makes it compact and clean, opening the case requires 2 hands, not a joke. When closing it feels like a rusted door you have to apply some pressure and it makes a satisfying click imitating the airpods that do this with ease.

Overall just get these for convenience of wireless earbuds. Sound is ok so sure why not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I don't have them on for more than an hour at a time. But my experience until now has been great! I'm not an audiophile so my review on sound quality is based on my personal preference. If you're looking for mega bass this is probably not for you. If you're an average user like myself I highly recommend these. Haven't had it disconnect once while wearing it paired to my phone (Galaxy S8+). Only time I noticed an intermittent disconnection was when I walked to the other side of my house to use the restroom. Never fell out from my ears while running either. Only thing I find useless is when I turn on background noise and voice because it doesn't really help but rather distorts the sound. Noise isolation is pretty decent but when using this during a redeye flight with a crying child a few rows away I still heard it. Wasn't very loud and my volume wasn't extremely high either but wasn't to my expectations.

The sound is pretty decent, not the best but definitely above average.  The Bluetooth connection is really solid and I have not experienced any cutting out as I did with my previous pair(TWS-X10)  I usually don't spend over $100 for headphones because I'm always sceptical of the performance value.

The Seller (CellularTech) representative told me to send the ear buds to them if any warranty work was required, offered me $8.00 (US) since I had received the Paraguay version from CellularTech. I had difficulty understanding the Seller Rep., but it appeared that he wanted me to deal only with them to resolve any issues.

No menu options only volume or ambient sound  can be selected. On my 2018  icon x i have both and can adjust the menu i  use the ambient sound more than i thought. So imo if you have the 2018  the galaxy buds are not much of an upgrade  as far as what you can do with them.  Yes they are a smaller profile but if you just want a pair of wireless headphones  for talking maybe if you really into having different options for your music i don't think so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_224?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=224&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tested much cheaper and they've been much better. The touch controls are great, very responsive. In ear detection works fine but will only work when both buds are removed which is annoying. Call quality is garbage, they were echoing the whole time so basically unusable. Ambient sound does absolutely nothing and is just a feature they promote to sell more earbuds. The case is cool, wireless charging is nice. They were pretty uncomfortable in my ears bud thats been the case with most of them of the same style. Think the stem ones are better for me. The worst part about these and the main deal breaker is the range. You basically have to keep your phone on you at all times to use these. I had my phone in the garage and walked down to get the mail and they cut out maybe 10-15 ft away. Was gonna test them out when I mowed the yard but unless my phone was in my pocket they would cut out if I got too far, even if there wasn't anything in the way and I had line of sight.

It's also good for work environments since you can use one at a time and once the battery on one gets low just put tmit in the case to charge and use the other, though if you want to use both it still has good battery life I'll say about 3-4 hrs if you like to blas your music. If you have small ears like me it'll still fit if you have big ears they'll fit like a glove. They also dont take that long to charge and the case doesn't take long to charge either.

Sound quality is good for earbuds that are 100% wireless.

I'll recommend these over earpods because they come with wing tips and the airpods doesn't.

Once paired with your device all you have to do to connect is turn on your Bluetooth and open the case.

The touch pad is pretty responsive.

The sound was clear but lacking in bass. I am not a bass hound but I found I had to push the earbuds well into my ear in order to get adequate bass with help from the telephone's equalizer.  I could have lived with this sound quality.
I tried Comply foam ear tips - there was better bass due to a wider opening to the tiny speaker grill on the earbuds, but then the earbuds would not fit in the charging case.

The major issue which is a common failure with bluetooth earbuds was the poor connectivity when I put my
Samsung S8 phone in my pant's pocket while walking outdoors.  Other reviewers have reported this issue. I don't like
to carry my phone in my shirt pocket where it seemed to work a little better.  The handy app did update the earbud's firmware, an update that was supposed to fix connection issues along with other problems.

To be fair, many other wireless earbuds have similar issues connecting with bluetooth.  I suspect that the space limitations inherent in earbuds makes it difficult to have powerful enough bluetooth circuitry.

So I am returning these today.  It's hit or miss with many earbuds, including far more expensive ones than these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really love these things. But.....

The connection does otherwise suffer sometimes. I’ve had two sets of Galaxy Buds and used them with a few different phones. My biggest issue is an occasional lag where the earbuds will get out of sync with each other for a second (normally the left one), then sync back up. It’s jarring and seems to happen in crowded areas, possibly due to wireless interference.

voice calls are enhanced by a pair of microphones in each earbud that work to isolate your voice. The resulting audio is not what I’d call crystal clear, but callers could hear me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bass Boost option seems to drown out music so staying in dynamic is recommended for balanced high, meds, and lows. So with that said, those with iOS may want to look elsewhere as without the Dynamic option in the Wearables App, these do sound flat.

Ear tips come in 3 sizes; basically small, medium, and large. The Buds are by default attached with medium but I switched them out the large tips which seemed to fit properly and isolated sound the best for optimal audio. Definitely try out each one for your preference as well as the ear fins.

One issue I seem to have and reason why this isn't 5 stars was when using these, they seem to have very brief audio cut outs if my phone is fixated in a certain angle in my pants pocket. I would readjust my phone in my pocket and it would seem to stop. It only happened about twice in a 45 minute session but was still a concern in regards to it's Bluetooth connection. Hoping it won't be a consistent issue in my day to day but that's to be discovered as I use them more.

Easy to go running with and to sleep with. The sound quality isnt bad but it isnt anything special. Its like the akg ones in the Samsung s9+ package. They are a little bulky but you can still sleep comfortably with some maneuvering.

The case is very nice and it charges them wirelessly. All you have to do is charge them inside the case once in a while. The battery life is pretty good, I use them pretty much everyday for exercising and before sleeping.

They are small and easy to fit in your pocket. Happy to not have to deal with tangled wires anymore in my pocket which makes it worth it. Also I don't have to deal with wires when I'm exercising.

They connect to your Samsung s9 almost instantly when you take them out of the case and put them in your ears. The single tap and double tap feature is very useful too. The noise cancellation is something I dont really need or use often. I like loud music when I'm exercising and I put the volume up to 80% of the max volume and that cancels my loud footsteps and breathing. I dont think I have noise cancellation on. The Samsung wearable Pp is pretty helpful too and I use it for the bass boost eq sometimes.

The noise cancellation isn't the best but I found the comply foam I ordered for my e8 fits the buds, the only drawback is the case doesn't close all the way but the seal and bass is so much better with them installed. Just be warned you'll have to pop them of to charge.

I have previously been using the Jabra Elite 65t and as such my review is mostly a comparison to those units. I have been using these to listen to music at the gym and on runs.

Pros:
+both smaller and lighter than 65ts
+pairing was as easy as opening the case, phone recognized immediately
+Speaking of the case, it also is smaller and lighter than the Jabras.
+Gear app works great and appears quite polished.
+Takes a little time to get used to the button location, but once you do they're easy to use and are responsive
+USB-C port
+Wireless charge from S10 phone

Cons:
-Sound is a little better on 65ts (both in bass and volume, although I have no business having volume that high)
-Would be nice if they included foam tips in addition to rubber.

All said I really enjoy these. Yes the sound is better with the Jabras but they are also more expensive and fall behind in every other category I can think of. I do really wish foam tips would be included as I prefer them to rubber. I noticed the size/weight difference on runs and only had to take out and dry off once. I did experience a few skips while at the gym but less so than the 65ts and figure this is just due to interference. I am curious as to their water resistance but seemed to stand the test of a few runs without issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, they are awesome for music quality.  You can use one earbuds while the other is charging in the case.  That case has an internal battery that you can charge and whenever you put your earphone away they will charge with the built in battery that's in the case.  The case has two LED lights.  One light is internal and the other is external.  The LED colors are green, yellow and red.  I also love the size of the case.  I thought the earbuds would hurt my ears after hours of use but they are comfortable and they do not fall off.  If you happen to misplace your earbuds the app on your phone, ""Galaxy Wearable"" can find your earbuds.  The earbuds make a chirping sound to locate your misplaced earbuds.  You can also charge these earbuds with, ""Wireless Powershare"" with your phone or any other wireless charging device.  I've had these for about three weeks and they work great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Likes:

Smaller
Fits Iin  ear more comfortablely
Sounds great
Less time to connect to phone
Super easy pairing
Gear Wearable app features are great!
More battery time!!

Dislikes:
Touch controls are a little more touchy than old pair
Wireless charging pretty slow

Overall, I like these better. For me, removing the on board storage was a good thing. I never use these without my phone, so it was a wasted feature for me. Good thing about it is that the buds no longer wait for your to interact with the online storage, THEN set to control the phone. Now, straight to phone control.

The case goes not have a lock latch. You can decide of that is good for bad, but I miss it.

Touch controls. I'm REALLY used to the touch controls and dont have an issue with using them. However, on the buds, I almost have to learn again. The responsiveness isn't there. Most times, double tap is registered as single. Triple taps are harder. Might just need to get used to less sensitivity? Who knows.

The wearables app has some new shiny things to it with these over the Icons. Better placement of settings and an EQ!! Ambient sound, which I LOVE has some more improvements. Better controls on which sounds get more priority.

Sound. Everyone wants to k ow about the sound quality. Honestly, I love these. Little more volume and clarity with these. In-call is really nice. I'm not an Audiophile, so might want to read a more in-depth review on this part from someone else. Im VERY happy with the sound quality.

I would give these 5 star, but the touch controls. Maybe it's me. I'll come back and revisit this part.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Great sound quality, nice range of treble and bass, full crisp and clean tones.

I love the fact that they charge in their case, and with customizable plugs it was easy to find a good fit for my ears. Battery life is very good, I am not sure what it is exactly but that's because I charge them nightly.

Noise cancelling is solid. Unlike some other reviews I read, I have zero issues with sound quality on inbound or outbound phone calls with these in and I usually talk while walking outdoors. People on the other end say I sound like I am on a LAN line it's so clear.

The ONLY issue I have that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is I like my music dangerously loud and these just get to loud.

On full charge, the tend to last around 4 hours. They pair fairly easily with my OnePlus 7 Pro. All in all, I'd say they are the best buds I've tried so far...with one glaring problem: you can't manually power them off without the case. The only way to turn them off is to put them back in the case. They don't turn off automatically after you stop playing audio. They don't turn off automatically if you turn off bluetooth completely. They just sit there and drain and drain and drain.

Also, others on calls report hearing every single background noise so I'm constantly being asked to go on mute.  i did expect better!

The first thing I noticed about these was how small the carrying case actually is. Just holding the case feels good in my hand. My wife commented that it looked sort of like a Kinder Egg that my daughter loves.

Pairing was a breeze. I honestly think downloading the app took longer than actually pairing the earbuds to my phone. The app is very intuitive and walked me through the setup easily. After updating the firmware, I put the earbuds in and was surprised how comfortable they are in my ears. I've tried many earbuds and none were all that comfortable but these are great. Other earbuds actually hurt my ears but these fit like a glove.

The sound quality is very good but I wish they had more bass to them. I like my music with a bit of low end. When watching videos, there was a slight delay between the picture and the audio but not terrible.

Overall, I really like the Samsung Galaxy Buds. I'm excited to use them a lot more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Material: Solid build quality, metal mesh inside the earpiece. Case is solid and holds the buds in place.
Look Fit: includes different tips and are very comfy. Have ran about 8 miles with them and had 0 issues with them getting loose or falling out.
Connection: The only issue i found was when my phone was juggling between these and my car's bluetooth. 0 problems with them in my pocket. You can get at least 25 feet from the phone without any connection degrade.
Instantly pairs when you open the case. Open the case, throw them in and tap the side and boom: wireless music.

Have had some time to get familiar with all the features and functions. I use them every day at work, GYM and at home. The adaptive dual microphone feature is great at work, if I have someone talk to me while I’m listing to music, or if my desk phone rings I can still hear it. The battery has lasted me roughly 5 hours of straight usage, mixed talk, and music. The charging case will re-charge them, but since I remove them here and there and dock them the battery can last closer to the advertised 10-11hours. Plus owning a Samsung S10+ with reverse charging I can give them a boost of power while on the go if necessary. These have to be some of the best sounding headphones I have ever owned, I used to think my AKG over the hear headset was the best, but they are bulky and not work, or GYM friendly. The should quality when wearing both is immersive, and can make you forget you're in a loud office or loud GYM. Bass and Treble are balanced and offer great voice and music capability.  Often use them after work at the GYM, and having them be sweat resistant is great! Plus, they don’t fall out or feel obtrusive in my hear during running or cardio. My old AKG wires headphones would prevent me from enjoying my work out with cords to adjust. Using them is simple enough, just make sure to select the right size earpiece, I found the default one it ships with fits perfectly. But there are optional S, L in the box. Controlling the Buds is done with your finger via touch, you can take calls, end them, change tracks, turn up or down the volume. And if you remove them it will pause the music which is great so you don’t ever miss a beat. To pair them to my S10, all you have to do is open the case, and the Phone UI will detect them and display the Galaxy Buds on screen with name, and battery level. So, pairing them takes but a few seconds. I was able to also use them on my iPhone Xr, different setup process, but simple none the less. Fist make sure they are not currently synced to Android by turning off Bluetooth on Android device, the open the clamshell case and have iOS search for Bluetooth devices, it will show up as Galaxy Buds (####). Select the corresponding Buds and pair. Once paired they will work like any other Bluetooth headset for iOS. The only downside to iOS is that firmware updates will not work, you will need to re-sync them to Android via the Gear App for them to check and keep to up to date. Overall these earbuds are some of the best I have ever owned, and you will not be disappointed, they come in Black, White and Yellow to match any personality and mood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Paired with my Galaxy S10, they sounded good (though not Bose quality, which I'm a bit biased towards anyway), they connected easily, and felt comfortable. It was great having no wires to worry about at all. However, this whole experience is CRIPPLED by the fact that these buds suck on any other device that's not made by Samsung. I often use my home computer and work computer to listen to music, videos, etc. And these headphones sound TERRIBLE on those devices, both Windows computers. Sure, I can download an equalizer to improve this, but I shouldn't have to. And there's no official Samsung Windows app either, so I can't adjust anything that I would be able to adjust on my phone. They could at least make it so that the headphones remember the settings from your phone. My previous Bose Soundsport Wireless sounded the same on every device, no downloading or adjusting the equalizer or anything. Now, if you just use these with your Galaxy and no other device, they're fine. But this limited functionality is just lame, and it's a shame that Airpods work and sound better on other devices compared to these, right out of the box. Really disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

*I purchased my buds on the 27th of August. About a month and a week later, people couldn't hear me clearly, I had connection issues and the left ear bud stopped functioning altogether.

Now, I called Amazon, (past my 30 days etc... )they got in touch with samsung and they agreed to send me another pair. I sent my pair in on the 15th Of October and I just received my exchange on 22th of October. I have not tried my new pair out. I just opened the box yesterday.*

Okay now for the review.

Battery
They last roughly around 5 hours instead of 6. It does depend on volume and the ambient sound feature. For comfort, they are solid. In my opinion could be better but it isn't the worst.

Comfort
They have winglets and buds for multiple ear sizes. They don't feel too heavy or awkward. Which is what you'd expect. If I could rate this area it would be a solid 4.5 I love how convenient they are and feel when I have them on.

Charging and connectivity
The charging process is a bit slow, and it is slower than I expected. Now that isn't a serious issue, it is more of want than a need. You can give a quick charge from what the manual says and it does give some juice for a bit so like I said, it isn't a serious issue.

 I usually just give it a 30 minute or 1 hour charge so I don't have to worry about running out of battery again before my work shift is over.

They connected every time when I first got them. I had zero issues with connections. They give you good range when you are far from your phone. It wasn't until later on when I began to have issues with connections.

Volume and Quality
I used them everyday. They don't get so loud that the person beside you can hear clearly what you're listening to, as they shouldn't. So the volume is fine for me. The noise cancellation is great and with the proper fitments on the bud you won't hear a thing.

The call volume is fine as well. I hear people clearly and they did hear me at times until I started having issues. The wearables app gives you a few settings for your preferences on how you want things to sound so that gives you options. The ambient feature is decent on this device. It does what it is intended to do.

The quality is where it hurts it in my opinion. I feel like the materials are well made but the software and electronics could be better. At times I might get a strange (zip or zap) sound when i'm listening to music when my phone is in my pocket or far away.

When the ambient is on,  it picks up sharp sounds and amplifies them so that can be a bit uncomfortable if you have sensitive hearing.

The touch pad/screen feature is nice. I like it a lot but it doesn't seem to work as well as I thought it should have. You can configure your tap options but it did feel more of a chore to pause them versus just taking one ear bud out. That is more of me wanting instead of needing again. It isn't THAT bad but I would like a more responsive touch pad.

Overall I think it is a solid buy. Amazon and Samsung took care of me so I can't be upset. The price is standard for the segment but I recommend getting a refurbished pair or a pair on a discount.

To me they aren't worth 100 plus dollars. I think they are worth a fair 70 at best because of what I mentioned above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you read it, you may gain some insight on the Galaxy Buds :) I was compelled to do this review because of how Amazon’s customer service > Samsung’s “customer service” and for how great this product truly is. I preordered my S10+ only to be one of the many who were unlucky enough to not get it included with the phone, and would subsequently have to wait ""15 days for the promotional $130 gift card only for usage on Samsung.com” ..not sure if I will receive that or not because the promotional support is extremely subpar for such a revolutionizing smart phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10+; so, I decided to order it on Amazon and will use the $130 for a Micro SD or some other accessories, if I get it.
Amazon... you continue to amaze me :) I ordered these Galaxy Buds on Wednesday, 03/13/19 with a an originally scheduled delivery range from 04/05/19-04/29/19. THESE BUDS ARRIVED 3 DAYS LATER ON Saturday, 03/16/19. WHAAATT?? Thank you, Amazon!!! Now THAT is quality service for these quality Galaxy Buds!
The new 2019 Galaxy Buds are purely amazing.
The highs are great; I personally have the sound toggled to ""Bass Boost"" on the Galaxy Wearable app and the sound is utter bliss. I have a pair of ""noise-canceling"" Bose QuietComfort 35 II, and the sound quality on these Galaxy Buds definitely compare with “elite” brands because of its quality. I find these Buds to be on an even keel as far as sound quality with a variety of genres in the “Bass Boost” mode: rap, rock, country, reggaeton, opera, and even classical all sound great with these Buds. Trust me, I have songs in my playlist that have different ranged bass lines, I managed to fit 2 12” Rockford Fosgate subwoofers in my Subaru BRZ, and these Buds’ sound quality did not diminish and did not distort even with the heavy bass line usage. I normally use headphones to listen to classical music while I am studying, doing a project for work, or just like everyone else- shell off from the outer world. As a test, the Buds were able to ""cancel"" the screech of the BART cars when I was riding BART earlier while the volume was at 75% to full volume, something the Bose QC 35 II sadly could not do despite its ""noise-canceling” capabilities. (BART is an extremely loud, outdated train transit system in the SF Bay Area).
Not sure why the finish on the exposed part of the Buds is glossy, it would have been better off as a matte finish because it is bound to get oily fingerprints all over it. The “Touchpad” is not as responsive and comfortable as I would like. It is going to take some time to get used to because when one taps on the touchpad, to play/pause/skip it kind of drives the silicone padding into your ear drum- and is somewhat deafening with the taps. The touchpads can be customized to do voice command, quickly adjust ambient sound, or volume up/down with a touch and hold gesture. The ambient sound is an interesting feature to use, especially when someone needs to be alert with their surroundings.
In sum, the delivery was just like ordering anything with Amazon Prime, despite the projected delivery being 3-6 weeks from now. The Galaxy Buds can compare with “noise-canceling” rated headphone despite not being rated to cancel out noise. The sound quality is purely amazing with great highs and lows that do not distort no matter how heavy the bass line is. The finish is glossy, but who cares it’s going to be in your ears! The Touchpad

On the pro side, the buds were super super comfortable. i barely felt it on my ear, but what good is comfort if you cannot use it. the comfort level is the reason this got 2 stars.

These headphones are basically useless.

1) Phone Calls - you simply cannot use them for phone calls. Audio alternates buds non stop, sounds very choppy, and literally every single time I've tried to use them for a phone call, people have told me that I sound really faint and muddy. I was hoping to replace my AirPods with these (I have the S10) but instead go back to the AirPods every single time.

2) Music - the sound is garbage unless using the equalizer and turning the volume to the max. At that point, they sound OKAY. I have similar connection issues when listening to music too - alternating buds, the songs actually skipping...they're just a mess.

I'm returning these, they are literally useless. Samsung had a huge opportunity to put out a quality product and dethrone Apple. These things don't even feel like a beta product, they feel like they are in early development phase of the product cycle.

Situation:
I use these earbuds daily while I run.  I stream youtube videos in the background while running.  I've done this for years with other wireless earbuds.  For some reason, after 10 minutes, the video stops playing.  I have to stop my run, pull out my phone, and press play.  The earbuds wont let me restart the video by pressing the button on the earbud.  I have to manually restart the video every time on my phone.

The same issue will have happen again approximately 10 minutes later and then randomly throughout my run.  It's happened every single time I've run with these headphones.

I tried the B&O's and though they sounded great they were extremely uncomfortable and stuck out of my ears  way too far.

I'm happy to say that the Samsung's are very comfortable and sleek.  I can wear these for 90 minutes plus with very little discomfort.  They stay in my ears while working out too!  Once in a while I have to twist them back into place but not too often.

The sound quality is ok.  It's definitely not as good as the B&O but those are more than twice the price.  These are tuned to favor the highs for sure, and at first sounded too harsh.  But either I got used to them or they are now broken in, they don't bother my ears anymore.

As far as connectivity goes they have yet to drop out or disconnect.  They pair up quickly with my phone and laptop, and the app is easy to use.

I believe it was due to a few software updates for the driver's. I'm not sure but they work great now. I'm glad I did rush to return them. I have using them and sound quality is great.

Update 5/8/2019, Day 2: I did some trouble shooting. Reset my Earbuds and reinstalled app. I found if you continuously tap on the Device Name, which you will find if you click on About Earbuds in the Wearables app, you can test the headphones to see if they are functioning properly. I placed the headphones on my phone and started test. Test came out as Passing on all data. Now when you place the Earbuds in your ear it will state that the Proximity L and Proximity R FAIL which happens only when they are in your ear and means you need to take them off to get an accurate test. So far so good. Will possibly give 5 stars and may not return after all. Glad I tried trouble shooting.

Day 1: Just received the Galaxy Buds today. I love Samsung products. Usually very trusting of them. Sadly I got a defective pair. Very disappointing. The left earbud makes no indication of being placed in ear. I believe it's a sensor defect. The right earbud does make a sound when placed in ear. The app also shows me that ambient sound is not possible since both are not in my ear when they definitely are. I looked at both to make sure examine differences and their seems to be no visual differences. Looks like the sensor is defective one the left ear for my pair. Hopefully can receive a different pair that's not totally defective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(Will update later)","So I was very hyped when I bought these, the reviews were good and the headphones just seemed amazing. But when they arrived at my house... I couldn't open the box itself, of all problems, the box really??? There were black marks on the box that looked it has been wiped, there was a fingerprint on the bottom. The original seal was ripped and there was another seal on top of it that doesn't look like the original. I couldn't get the box to open no matter what, some of the sides were glued shut when I tried getting my fingers in, the only way to open it was to cut it open. It seemed like someone used it and returned it. I decided not to open it and just return the thing itself. BEWARE: The seller was Amazon. If you are buying this I wouldn't buy it with Amazon as the seller, in fact just go on to the Samsung website and buy it unless you have prime.

I was quite confident in this purchase after seeing all the positive feedback on these and witnessing how great the technology of the new S10 phones are.

CONS

¤After using the Galaxy Buds for two weeks, they have completely stopped working on me while having plenty of battery life left. This has happened 3 times now. Every time I have this problem I have to put the buds back in their charging case, close the lid, and leave them for 5 minutes. After that they are perfectly fine. (I guess this is like a reset button for the buds when they start glitching.. They definitely shouldn't be having this problem at all though considering how much I paid for them).

¤At one point the left bud completely stopped playing any sound from my phone and made a constant ringing noise that wouldn't stop. The ringing even continued on after I had disconnected the bud from my phone's bluetooth. This was also ""fixed"" by putting the bud back into it's case for 5 minutes to reset it.

¤Along with this, the sound quality is quite average in comparison with countless other earbuds I have used in the past. The price is definitely not worth the quality of sound these have. It's not terrible, but it isn't impressive either.

¤I've also had what seems like connection issues. Whenever I'm sitting down or busy doing things around the house (phone in pocket), my music cuts out and gets choppy every so often. It's gotten so bad that every song I'd play would start cutting out for no apparent reason.

PROS

¤A few great things that I love about these is the touchpad on the buds has come very convenient for me (especially while driving and at work).

¤I also love the ""find your earbuds"" feature for these on the Galaxy Wearable app. It's saved me from loosing one or both of my buds a few times already.

¤The ambient sound option (which is also on the Galaxy Wearable app) has been convenient at times.

¤The battery life typically lasts 7-8 hours.

¤They fit nicely.

¤I can monitor how much battery life is remaining in each bud using the Galaxy Wearable app, which has been very useful.

Overall I found that the cons outweigh the pros, which is why I will be returning my Galaxy Buds. I do not believe the price is worth the quality I have received.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My issues with the headphones are the ambient sound performance and connectivity performance.

The ambient sound passthrough is not effective enough to make a difference. I was hoping to be able to wear these and be aware if someone was trying to get my attention, but they dont even pick up the ringing of my phone.

The other issue is a little more serious and that is the connection will sometime drop out of one of the buds. I have to remove the bud, place in the case and then try again.

Not for small ears. Noticeable video delay. Disappointing experience","Pros: Price. Sound quality. Design and look. Style and compact size.
Cons: Uncomfortable fit. Noticeable latency in video/audio sync. Missing features with iPhone. Easy to mistakenly activate touch features.

I really wanted to like these. I did extensive research before settling on these. I read most review articles and watched many of the available pre-release video reviews on Youtube. I was comfortable dealing with the iPhone compatibility limitation but was ultimately disappointed with the discomfort of the fit. I tried to deal with it for a few weeks but decided to return them in the end.

The fit wasn't the only issue. The latency/delay of audio with video was too much to deal with. I mostly use Youtube, and while on my commute, my viewing experience was unenjoyable. Anything involving precise action or comedic punchline was virtually unwatchable. I had a $6 pair of Bluetooth in-ear headphones that had better latency than these, so I was very disappointed.

Using an iPhone significantly limits your experience. Upon researching, I was willing to try these with the missing features, but it seems crazy that with all the available apps, Samsung couldn't come up with an iPhone app to allow you at least some of the features (at the time of purchase there was nothing available - not sure what the current app features may be).  Because of this, I can't speak to the functionality of the ambient noise control feature.

Another annoyance was the touch controls. The earbuds are very small (a good thing), so there is limited space for you to handle them. Half the time I was handling them to put them in my ear, I would activate something by accident. Or if I needed to reposition or adjust placement in my ear, it was activate something unintentionally.

If you have bigger ears and a Samsung/Android phone, you'll probably love these. As an iPhone user with small ears, these were no good.

I decided to go with the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air earphones. They kind of look like Airpods, but with soft buds. They fit comfortably and have great battery life for almost half the price. I recommend these as an alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The size and fit were perfect, the sound great and the price very fair. However, I ended up returning them for two specific reasons. 1) I decided I like the headsets that wrap around my neck that I can conveniently insert when I need them, and the battery lasts longer. 2) Even with the sound pass-through, I had to take these out to have a person-person conversation, which meant putting them back in the case until needed again. That was less convenient than the around the neck headphones I bought where thay just hang around your neck until needed.

Warranty does not cover replacement.","I bought these earphones on April 3, 2019. The wireless charging case stopped charging the earbuds in July 2019. These earbuds are used for the office to block out noise so there was very little wear and tear on the unit. I called Samsung customer care since it was within 1 year of purchase. Samsung sent me a wall plug and a charging cable...

After receiving the wall plug and charge cable, I called Samsung to ask why a wireless charging case was not sent out as discussed with the previous customer representative. The second customer rep apologized and told me that the one year Samsung warranty for the wireless earbuds does not cover the wireless case. My only option is to buy the entire set. I can't just buy the charging case.

Did I mention that I bought these wireless earbuds on April 3, 2019 and they stopped working July 2019? Great warranty Samsung. I should have bought a Jabra elite 65t instead.

When testing them, leave them in for at least 10/15 minutes to get a good idea, also shake your head around and make sure they are secure.

Having the wireless charging is a best option as now there is no need for charger for the earbuds when they can be wirelessly charged by the Samsung S10+.

The Wearable app gives much further control into seeing the sound Equalizer types and Ambient Sound options and Touchpad controls on the Buds with an option to set a custom control.

Setup of buds is quite simple and easy to setup, just opening the case near a Samsung Phone prompts user to set up the Galaxy Buds.

Good feature is that each bud can be used independent of the other which is always good when working at office where one headphone suffices.

But upon talking about what is missing, there is no option to see how much charge the case holds at a moment so it would be all guesswork as to when to charge the case.

Upon frequent use, noticed that each bud lasts for about hour and a half or so, and case charges them 2-3 times.

Size of the Galaxy Buds remains as same as the Gear Icon X, but the features have improved a lot, including the connectivity and charge time. Also the white color is really good. Earbuds are detected as put in and instantly shows the Connected message on phone and shows the previous volume level that was set.

When updating software on earbuds, it still requires both earbuds to be connected and it takes over 2 monites to update 1mb and earbuds are useless during that time so was disappointed in that.

All in all, a really good earbud with good Equalizer options and easy control trackpad

Pros:
Compact size
Individual earbud usage
Wireless Charging

Cons:
No option to check Case battery
Long update times","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tried so many others but they all had various issues and the worst being people did not understand me when I was speaking on the phone especially when the batteries were low.  I love that you can use these as a pair or use thr right or left ear bud by itself. You can take them in and out of your ear without disconnecting the call. The sound quality is good but I wish it was a little louder but this would possibly damage your hearing so where it is works. It also has a nice feature that alerts you when thr battery is low and needs to be charged. The charging cradle does a fine job of giving you additional power on the run. The cradle also has a longer charging cable than all the others I've tried. There's also a handy app that you install for these earbuds that also lets you know the battery life in percentages. Another thing I love is the ease of paring these and the ease of them connecting with Bluetooth whether it is on a mobile device or with the hands-free module in my car. Finally, the earbuds are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They have a little wing that helps them stay put while they are in your ear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Probably about 85% of the time they worked fine but each time I'd get into patches of interruption where the sound would cut out or momentarily be louder in one earbud. I'm not sure what the interference is. For reference this is through a suburban neighborhood. I tried it several times with the same result. I then tried the same route but using them paired with my Note 8 phone and I don't recall it dropping even once, so it's something between these buds and the Gear Fit 2. Both items have the latest updates. Aside from that trouble the sound is great and they're even more comfortable than Samsung's last true wireless earbud model (which felt great). I recommend changing the functions through the Gear app so one bud is volume up and one volume down. This is off by default.

-Improved battery life, form factor and sound over iconX 2018
-Can use one bud at at time while charging the other
-Case charges while open
-Can pair without case
-Comfortable fit
-Wireless charging case

CONS:
-Limited controls compared to iconX (can't have ambient/volume controls at the same time)
-No noise cancelling, but this wasn't expected
-Worse water/dust resistance
-Can't use ambient mode with just one bud

Improved some features over iconX 2018 like battery life, charging while case is open, ability to use just one bud, form factor.

Lost some features like touch pad controls of iconX where you had more controls. You could control volume by swiping up/down in addition to the tap and tap+hold features. With the buds, you only get tap and tap+hold. For tap+hold you can ONLY choose assistant, ambient modes or volume controls. If you choose volume controls then you can't do the other modes.

Glad to see they carried over the notifications function where it can read the full notification or summary. I'd like to be able to hear my full notifications without having to glance at my watch or phone. I want to be able to keep one bud in for this, but you can't use ambient mode with just one bud at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, for Galaxy Buds owners who also own one of the variants of Galaxy S10, that may well be the case. I’m not talking about plugging in the USB-C cable, rather the moment you find yourself short of juice, take your S10+, flip it over, place the Galaxy Buds case on to the rear of the phone, and watch the Buds’ charging light ping to life. Now *that* is a feeling of deep satisfaction. It’s important to note, wirelessly charging your Galaxy Buds from your phone isn’t just a party trick, nor is it incredibly useful in a pinch, but it’s also an indication that Samsung is thinking of its product line as an entire ecosystem, rather than siloed products. This may seem like an unusual place to begin a review, but it feels like Samsung’s wireless earbud line have finally achieved truly wireless status, which is an important landmark. As an owner of both previous generations of their earbuds, the Galaxy Buds feel like everything learnt with the previous generations has been applied. Bluetooth connectivity, a little sketchy on previous models, has been improved to the point that in 3 weeks I’ve experienced no issues whatsoever. Other more subtle improvements have been made, such as a more compact pocket-friendly case, and its ‘push-button open’ mechanism (which failed after three weeks on a previous model) has been replaced with a simple foolproof prise-open design. Where they have learnt from issues of earbuds past, they’ve also understood and retained the strengths of previous generations, such as the touch-sensitive shell that allows you to control your music without having to rummage around for your phone. The design, too, is subtle. While a certain Cupertino-based competitor has a design that is ugly but unmistakably ‘them’, Samsung is content to make the Galaxy Buds almost invisible, which for me, is exactly what I’m looking for. Finally, and most importantly, when it comes to audio quality the clarity and depth of tone and bass is fantastic, and again, a further improvement over the already stellar experiences of previous generations. The only drawback is related to the microphone, which falls short of the high bar set by every other aspect of these buds – feedback I’ve had is the mic quality is ‘fine’, but when every other aspect of the Buds is ‘great’, it leaves something for Samsung to improve for the Galaxy Buds 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've never used ""true"" wireless earbuds before but after some research I decided to get these and I think I made the right choice.

The sound quality is pretty good for what you spend, although the ""dynamic"" equalizer preset in the app is really the only one that's worth anything. Definitely use that and you'll have the best experience. I've listened to a range of music from metal to indie folk to soundtracks, and these seem to handle it all just fine. The sound isn't the fullest, but does enough to be enjoyable to listen to.

I really, really struggle to find earbuds or IEMs that stay in my ears with any kind of reliability and these definitely do. They're VERY secure with the wing attachments in place, but with that configuration I do start to get some soreness at about 1.5-2 hours of constant use. It seems like they're missing a size in the three options they include, because they go from essentially no wing, to a fairly large one, to one with the same height plus some extra material towards the back. They should include a size between those first two where the wing itself is smaller. That said, for just sitting at my desk they actually do stay put with the ""no wing"" attachment, and it's much more comfortable for long periods like that, so it works out.

Just a word on connectivity as well, since I heard that without a Samsung device to connect to it can be a real pain. I've had no problems pairing these with my phone. I'll get a couple weird flickers here and there throughout a day of listening, but nothing that I wouldn't just expect from a wireless connection of anything really. That said, I'll be taking these on a plane trip this weekend so I'll definitely update this review if I encounter any issues when everybody else around me is also using wireless devices.

Overall, I've had a good experience with these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Worth the money.","Only had these for a day, but I can tell you so far they are the best buds I've owned. I've had Beats, I've had Bose, I've have Sony, and I've had LG. All have been bluetooth, but none are close as good. Right out of the box, mine were fully charged. As soon as I took 1 bud out and placed in my ear, it was simple to connect to my Note 8. Sound quality is really good. It's not super loud, but loud enough. So far the call quality has been great. I can hear caller very well as well as they can hear me. Setting 1 dominant is as easy as putting one in your ear and touching the button to turn it on. I have been VERY skeptical about which buds to buy with all of the different options out there. I can honestly tell you at this point,  I made the best decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_209?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=209&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even doing yard work with a mower or weed wacker going these are nice so you don't have to blast the music to drown out the outside noise. They're light and comfortable and the battery life is fantastic. I'm one who doesn't care about case battery life I want listening battery life. What good are buds that you can't listen to all day?

Compare to Bose Soundsport wireless.","I have owned Bose Soundsport Wireless buds for over a year.  I just got these Samsung Galaxy Buds.  These are my observations to compare the two.  The sound quality of the Galaxy Buds is weak in my view.  The details of the music are just not there.  The Bose just kill these when you listen to music.  You hear a lot more of the details of the music.  There is more volume , bass, treble with the Bose and you do not even have to mess around with the equalization in some app.  Phone communication is very good with the Galaxy buds.  I have had no complaints regarding clarity of voice on calls.  The Galaxy buds are also more discreet looking as some people have not even realized i had them in .  They sit in your ears and do not stick out like the BOSE.  However, both the BOSE and the Galaxy are very comfortable to wear for extended time.  I like the touch control on the Galaxy but you cannot control volume and ambience. YOu have to choose one or the other when you set it up.  So i have not really experimented much with the ambience to say whether it is any good or not.  I really like the wireless charging case for the galaxy buds.  However, i like the fact that i can attach my Bose case to a belt loop to carry them with me.  I do not have a lump in my pocket like with the Galaxy buds.  Having a cord connecting the 2 ends  of the BOSE is not really all a negative.  When you want to take them out of your ears, they hang around your neck.  The cord also makes it harder for you to lose them.  The cord is behind your neck so really you hardly know it is there.  When riding my bike i go with my BOSE as they are louder and if one did fall out of my ear then it is attached with the cord.  If a Galaxy bud fell out of my ear while riding, it would be history.  That said,  I think the Galaxy buds sit securely in my ears and they have not fallen out.  Overall, i like the Galaxy buds but the sound quality is a disappointment.  My real rating on these is probably 3 1/2 stars.  I mark it down from 4 only because of the sound quality.  Talk quality is great though.  If you do not use these for music and mostly talk or podcasts then these are a solid 4 to 5 star.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Essentially perfect customizable shape, never falls out.

Sound quality is good, not quite as good as corded headphones, especially in noisy environments, but it does come close.

The ambient feature is innovative but it needs refining, since it doesn't pick up sound behind you.

Finally the thing that needs to most improvement and would probably be the easiest fix is the gesture controls. Hate having choose between volume, play/pause, skip and ambient.

Ambient feature should be activated by touching both buds at once like a screenshot instead of being one sided.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A nice set of earbuds!!","My search for the best and most cost effective earbuds has not been a very easy or quick experience. I must have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews, saw many review videos, and tried and returned 7 different brands based on their recommendations, before I finally decided to go with the Galaxy earbuds. Honestly, I thought that I would never find a pair that sounded great with both phone and music, and had a decent battery life. You would think that the countless reviews on Amazon and other websites I looked at would make my decision easy, but this just wasn’t the case.

I actually found the reviews to be extremely unhelpful and so black and white that it made me completely confused. I would read 5 verified reviews praising a product for the exact same reason and then the next review would say that particular area of praise was shit. I mean really! Sometimes I think other brands have people do this to throw off potential buyers and if so it worked. But really, I just didn’t appreciate the sheer magnitude of this type of thing. It’s so frustrating as a potential customer to spend such a ridiculous amount of time trying to decipher which are true. We all have better things to do.

Ok so about these earbuds...This is everything you need to know without all the unnecessary crap.

These buds are extremely comfortable and come with several size rubber pieces to get a great fit.
Very reasonable price for such a great product.
They are the perfect size and not obtrusive at all. Also, the size of the case is very small so super easy to carry in a bag or your pocket.
You can touch gently to control your music, answer/hang up calls, etc.
They pair very easily to any Bluetooth and make a cool sound when they detect that they are in your ears. It’s automatic...
They have an app so if you have an Android you can download that allows you to customize your sound, ambient noise, and see any battery life remaining.
The sound for music is VERY good. They sound like you are in the front row of a concert. Rich, immersive, and not crazy base but definitely good base.
EVERYONE can hear me fine and not 1 person ever makes a comment or even knows I am on them. Also, I hear them great as well...Hallelujah! And you can use both (which gives the voice a stereo sound) OR you can just use one (either). If you take one out during a conversation the conversation keeps going without any disconnect.
They stay put when exercising, dancing, hanging upside down.
A voice says email or text when you get one.
The battery life is very good...I honestly haven’t counted the hours but I can wear them all day without any problem. I think I have maybe charged the case every few days or so...just depends on how long you are using them.

The ONLY negative for me is that they do seem to cut out for a second here and there when it’s windy outside. But for a very brief moment and that’s it. But really not a deal breaker at all, especially after I have experienced what else is out there.
Also, they might not be waterproof but they are sweat proof I think?

I hope this review has been helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm training for a marathon so I really wanted a pair that I could wear running totally hands free. Almost every run they would just stop working and I'd have to restart my phone. When I finally got them to work again, they would constantly cut out with almost every step I took. It was so incredibly frustrating. Even just walking they would cut out with my phone in my pocket. The only time I would have a good experience with them is at work when I was sitting at my desk doing nothing.  Sound quality was horrible even when it worked.

I got them replaced and the pair of  buds I have now works perfectly, but there are 2 issues:
Cons:
1-Ambient sounds doesn't work good enough to hear people, I use my buds at the gym and when I need to speak to someone, I need either to remove one of them from my ears or get really close (uncomfortable close) to the  person to be able to clearly hear what they are saying.
2-One of the buds would stop working randomly during phone calls, it would just disconnect and you need to put them both back on the case and then put them on again to work. It doesn't happen often tho and you can stay on the call with the 2nd bud.
Pros:
1-So sounds it's incredibly awesome but such small buds, the bass is great and sounds quality in general is great, I love that you can play with the sound mode from the app
2-battery lasts for a good while plus you have the case
3-they are comfortable and easy to put on
4-they way they connect tso fast to the phone by just opening the case is great
5-love that you can configure what the touchpad buttons do on each of the buds
6-while using them, they let you know with a beep if they are overheating (like while being in a sauna)
7-they are not apple (good enough to be a pro-point)
8-the noise cancellation is great while you are using them

So, as I said on the title, they aren't the best probably, but for that price they are good enough for me, I'd buy again","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are really nice feeling and ergonomic in a way that my old AirPods just never were.  Also the sound quality is top notch when it comes to music or spoken-word audio.  The noice cancelling aspect works great which can be easily overridden with a feature that allows you to hear ambient sounds (a feature only usable on Android devices, unfortunately).

I purchased these as AirPod replacements.  I wanted something with some proper water resistance and good audio quality.  My AirPods had slipped out of my hands one day and fell right into a puddle.  They still work but at a significantly reduced sound quality.  After reading reviews on several different kinds of wireless earbuds, I eventually settled on these as a replacement set.  They worked very well on my iPhone, however a major downside to using these with an iOS device is you don't have access to the ""Galaxy Wearable"" App which allows you to adjust settings or use the ambient sound feature.  This doesn't make a lot of sense since there already is a Galaxy Watch app for iOS which allows you to use Samsung Galaxy watches on iPhone.  I feel like this App should be ported over, it could only mean more sales for Samsung if they did.  As they are now, for the basics of listening to music or other audio, making phone calls or talking to Siri, they work great.

Then I had another water-related mishap with my iPhone and I was forced to revert back to my old Samsung Galaxy S6.  On the S6 I've had a very mixed experience.  I can now use the App and now have a more feature-rich experience.  The different options inside the Wearable app are pretty neat and contain a lot more detail than what you could achieve with the AirPods running natively on iPhone.  However, one gigantic flaw that I experienced to a limited degree on iPhone began to become insurmountable on the Galaxy: the bluetooth connection.  These headphones have the most strange relationship with their connected device once you go outside.  If I understood better the different radio frequencies at play with WiFi and Bluetooth maybe I could go into detail about what must be going on here, but near as I can tell anytime you reach the edge of any given WiFi range, the signal between the phone and the headphones begins to distort.  So if you want to use your headphones to listen to music or something while jogging in the neighborhood, they are functionally useless since you are always in this dead-zone and distortion occurs.  The sound crackles and skips or just goes silent.  The audio is still playing on the device and once you get back in a distortion-free area you can hear it again, not paused or anything but having advanced normally as if you could hear the whole time.  There are some strange workarounds.  If I take the phone out of my pocket and hold it close to my head, the issue does not occur.  If I take my phone out and place it on a table outside, that also seems to work and I can hear fine while I stay within the normal Bluetooth range from the phone.

No, I am not streaming audio over Wifi, this happens regardless of whether the audio I'm listening to has been downloaded to the device or is being streamed.  I can turn WiFi off on my phone and it'll still happen.  Indoors I have almost never experienced this nor have I had it happen in my car.  It only seems to happen out of doors vaguely near buildings.  If I'm away from any buildings its fine.  This is why I am attributing it to a conflict between the WiFi signal and the bluetooth signal.  I don't have this issue with my AirPods or any other wireless headphones I've used over the years.  This is a massive pain and severely reduces their usability.  As such, they are very difficult to recommend.  If they can fix this with a future firmware update (which seems like something they should be able to do), then I can rate these higher.  The issue isn't as pronounced on iPhone.  However, without the app, there is no option to get updates and as such any issues you have will never get fixed.

EDIT 10/4/19: Several updates have come out since posting this and there have been some slight changes.  It seems like the problems I was having with distortion while out-of-doors have slightly improved.  The nature of the distortion has changed from an analog distortion sound to a digital distortion sound if that makes a any sense at all.  It distorts a little, little less than before, but it's almost unchanged.  They are still almost completely useless if you carry your phone in your pants pocket outside.  If you want to use them outside, you'll need to put your phone in a shirt pocket, hold it in your hand out at an angle, carry it in a purse so long as the bag doesn't hang below your hips, or use one of those armbands that were a thing back when people went jogging with their iPods.  I am a living/breathing sunk-cost fallacy so I will continue to use these headphones for at least another year to justify the cost, then I'm just hoping that whatever Apple is planning with their next release of the AirPods will include waterproofing and better audio.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The earpieces were a snug seal that even when I jumped up and down, never even move to come out. That seal also helps with the sound quality a lot. I did have to tweak the settings on the Buds app on my phone to find the right balance of sound. The sound it'self is great. The balanced sound had clear vocals and solid bass, I like the concept that you can maintain awareness of your surroundings. I tested it out while listening to TV, for example, you can hear the difference. I also like that I can answer calls I tested by making a few business calls to my client's offices and they seemed to have no problem hearing me. I could hear them clearly Overall, I am very happy and excited to use these! I LOVE being totally wire-free and the convenience and comfort of these. I do recommend these and I also would recommend as a user take a few extra minutes to adjust the right size and sound settings before making any final decisions or totally writing these off.

I've always held Samsung in high regard for many many years, as a user of their phones (myself and my entire family), as well as their monitors, and SSDs. This is their biggest failure so far: I used inexpensive bluetooth headphones for many years and I expected the buds to walk on water at this price. Instead, they were unusable with *all* the phones we have: two Galaxy S7, one Google Pixel and one Sony Xperia.  At best they simply did not connect at all (could not find them); at worst, it crashed the UI repeatedly.  According to the ""Samsung Expert"" (see here: https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S-Phones/Galaxy-Buds-and-S6/td-p/561809), it's an incompatibility between Bluetooth 4 and Bluetooth 5. This is BS: Bluetooth 5 should be backward compatible with Bluetooth 4 unless the manufacturer screw up. And they did!

This is obviously opinion based but because of features like the case style, actual bud looks, and they dont have the douche-vibes that you get with wearing apple airpods thus making the Galaxy Buds the best option.

Customization: #1
If you have a galaxy phone...forget it man the customization of the first gen Galaxy Buds is already light years above the competition.

Features: #1
Wireless charging, touch pad on ear buds, command customization, sound customization, EAR PIECE CUSTOMIZATION

Value: #1
$70 less than Bose, $30 less than airpods and far more features.

-Galaxy Buds are the reason I FINALLY got rid of my LAST apple product, airpods 🤮🤮🗑🗑","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I'm using them with an iPhone 8 Plus and there are some minor problems though. Can't get the app for customizing the buds, oh well. But I can't watch YouTube videos while using these as there is a significant latency issue, meaning the audio is out of sync with the video. So far that's the only time I've notice this as Netflix and such seem to be just fine. I can only change volume on my phone which isn't too bad as I can easily hit my volume buttons while my phone is still in my pocket. I've occasionally had an issue with them not connecting when I take them out and have to put them back in the case and out again but it's rare. But they have great audio quality, and they fit great thanks to the different wing and ear tip options that come with them. I like being able to have the touch options for pause/play, skip, back and even siri control with a press and hold. Despite the few negatives with these, they are still my favorite Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Would definitely recommend unless you're only planning on watching YouTube on an iPhone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But that was manageable - what is not is the earbuds constantly go out of sync with each other when using them on my laptop. The left earbud is about 0.5-1 second ahead of my right earbud, and happens without warning when I'm watching shows or youtube. They have no sync problems when I used them with my Galaxy s7 phone, but will go out of sync every few minutes on the laptop.

I'm using a new Dell laptop and have reinstalled drivers on my computer + tried resetting the earbuds, but the problem persists. Other truly wireless earbuds I've used had no problems (Jabra Elite 65t, Anker Soundcore, Master & Dynamic) so I know it's not my laptop. Googling the out-of-sync issue revealed that this is a pretty common problem too. So while I enjoyed these earbuds and had no problems with the not-great audio since the price was lower than most high-end earbuds, I can't recommmend these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you use these for the office and gym like me they are a good value. If you have an iPhone it likely won't work as well without the app so I wouldn't recommend these for Apple devices (I have a samsung personal phone and an apple work phone).

I've most recently tried out the Jabra Elite Active 65t headphones. They we pretty good and actually great when it came to call quality. However, they could never quite fit comfortably in my ear and so I couldn't use them for more than 10 minutes at a time without taking them out because my ear started hurting. I heard bad things about call quality and audio quality with the Galaxy Buds. I haven't used them for calling yet but compared to other headphones, they don't have the array of microphones so I can see why these would not be best suited for calls. This isn't an issue for me as I don't call a ton throughout the day. The audio quality is really similar to Jabras and perfect for casual listeners when used with a larger earbud tip. I thought this would be a bad compromise and hurt my ears for better sound quality but haven't had any comfort issues. These are the lightest while being the most secure headphones I've had. Definitely the best Bluetooth headphones I've bought yet and I have only had them a day. I have a Galaxy Note 9 so the app for these is a must.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They kept falling out of my ears.  I replaced them with these and the Galaxy Buds fit much better.  I still prefer the fit of Bose ""Stayhears,"" but the little fins on these are pretty good!

I was surprised to find that even though the overall weight of these and the Jabras are very close, it is distributed differently.  I tried many different aftermarket tips but these just work better for me and I feel less fatigue/irritation. It all depends on the fit for your ears.

The sound quality is decent once you find the right tips that isolate the sound in your ear canal.  Not nearly as good as wired earbuds.  My bose QC30s blueooth buds have significantly better sound but they require you wear the collar. These are much less constraining.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the very limited flexibility in what the earpads do when you tap them. You can't change the built-in function for single, double and triple taps.  All you can set is what happens when you touch and hold each earpad.

I wanted to be able to adjust volume up and down plus have a way to access Google Assistant/Siri.  Unfortunately, you can't do them all. If you pick volume up for one of the volume controls, the other is automatically set to volume down.  If you choose Siri, you can't do volume with the other ear, it has to be set to affect ambient sound, which isn't useful for me.

All in all, nice wireless earbuds at a better price than the Jabras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are just fantastic. They replaced my Jabra Elite 65t's for a handful of reasons I will explain below.

1. They are smaller and lighter: Maaaaan they are so much smaller and lighter. The Jabra's are like little onion bulbs in my ear. Now don't get me wrong, the Jabra's fit my ears wonderfully, they get great points for ergonomics, but the Jabra's are just too heavy, and they are on the large side. They don't fit small persons ears (i've tested it on friends and family with small ears and they are a no.) These Galaxy Buds on the other hand, are suuuper lightweight, and their ""pyramid"" shape is very ergonomic to the ear (at least mine, YMMV as always!) The other thing about the Jabra's are that one earbud is sliiiiightly heavier than the other, and man oh man, I could feel it all the time. It always felt like the heavier earbud was pulling on itself. The Galaxy Buds do not suffer from that issue, as they both are feather light and comfy AF.

2. Independent usage and control versatility: The earbuds controls are on both sides, and you can use EITHER earbud by itself. This is such a damn problem with 99% of earbuds out there. Other than some obscure Chinese OEM that may have that feature (which are mostly garbage), the only mainstream brand earbuds that share this same feature are the Apple Airpods. Being able to use either earbud by itself is super important to me. Be it walking around and being aware of my surroundings, or having one in while working. There are many situations where I use just one bud, and having the option of either side is wonderful. The added thing that many don't think of is that if you are going to be listening for a particularly long time (say to an audiobook/podcast all day long) then you can get continuous usage until you use up all the juice in the charging case. If you have one in and it gets low, just swap it out and let the dead one charge. You can't do that with all the earbuds that have a ""master/slave"" configuration where one bud is dependent on the other bud. Having the same controls on both sides (minus the tap-hold if you choose to use it for volume) is equally important in that regard, so you don't have to pull out your phone or use a smartwatch to do functions like pause and next and previous. ALL TRUE WIRELESS EARBUDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY.

3. Modern charging standards: USB C and Qi charging. Enough said. Everything is going C or Qi, so thank you Samsung for making it modern. The less cables I have to carry and/or buy, the better. Micro USB was a standard, but it's time has passed, and it needs to die gracefully. Don't even get me started on that one company's proprietary cables that they force down peoples throats and wallets...

4. Svelte charging case, ""pocket-ergonomic"": the only other earbuds worth a piss on the market that have a svelte and small charging case are (of course) the Apple AIrPods. They are still the king on the pocket-able size and shape of their product. Samsung is damn close though with the Galaxy Buds. They are very svelte, and their feeling in the pocket is just as good (as in, you hardly notice they are there) as the AirPods. Yes, some other earbud cases are ""squatter"" and some are ""skinnier"" but the other's don't get the shape right, so they always end up feeling like a fat stone in your pocket. The Galaxy Buds case melts into your leg and you don't even notice it's there (unless maybe your partial to skinny jeans. My experience is with standard jeans and slacks)

All in all, these hit all the sweet spots for price, style (no more toothbrushes thanks,) function, ergonomics, sound quality (better than AirPods, about on par with Jabra's. Don't expect B&O sound quality) and features. I don't think there is a better set of true wireless earbuds under $200. And to be honest, the concessions that some of the over $200 ones make you suffer is a dealbreaker.

If you want great wireless buds, these are the ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 Because of the reviews (which so often just are repetitions without real personal discernment) I was expecting great comfort/practicality and bad sound. I remember thinking: “why AKG would put a bad driver here when even their cheaper headphones are so good for the price? Why Samsung, using bluetooth 5.0, wouldn’t put a decent sound?""

 Well, either some reviewers (I mean Youtubers and web reviewers) are deaf, or the latest software update changed radically this TWE, because the sound is good! (as usual, just finding a good seal with the correct eartip size).

 This is a pleasant surprise, it exceeded my expectations and reminded me that “reviewers” often just convince themselves and others with preconceived notions.

Depending on your preference, the noise cancellation will be a blessing or a curse. If you're used to having airpods in and hearing your surroundings you won't like these. If you prefer to hear the conversation/music over lots of noise/noisy environments then these are your wireless earbuds.
Worth noting that these are the first headphones/earbuds/anything I've used while mowing my lawn and it actually cancels out the noise enough to enjoy what I'm listening too.

As a previous owner of the Iconx 2018, I was expecting some of the same feature passed down. For instance, on the Iconx 2018, you could set the main earbud to left or right. This was handy when running with my Garmin. Connection issues happen when the main earbud is set to the opposite ear of the arm your watch is own. So the watch is on your left arm and main bud is in your eight ear. This causes the connection to drop out continuously. This is something great the Iconx had. You could change it to any ear. This feature is lost to the Galaxy Buds. I have to change the watch to my opposite arm to combat this, and it's quite awkward

The biggest let down was they had no internal storage. This was very disappointing, as this was my favorite feature on the Iconx. I understand they wanted to cut the size down but they took away what made the Iconx so great.

I haven't decided whether I want to return them or not. If someone can tell me how to set the main earbud or get around this, I'll change my review. This doesn't mean telling me to move my watch to the other arm.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The sound is fine, but if you are moving, the sound drops out and/or the two earphones can get out of time with each other.  I bought these for working in the yard, and the were fine when I was stationary, but if I was walking, the sound was spotty and I even lost connection.  The problem is not with my phone.  I have used some CHEAP ($20) bluetooth earbuds with no problems.
Also, these are proprietary for Samsung - you even have to download an app.  One minor inconvenience is that it is really hard to time the ""double tap"" to skip tracks...I either tapped too fast for it to register, or too slow, which just does a pause/restart.

Second thing I did was charge these bad boys, and how did I do it? Through wireless charging of course, it didn't take more then an hour to charge, and once charged you actually get more then the 7 hour recharge on the case, more like 10 hours. So that's a plus. And the battery life on the buds themselves is the 6 hours that Samsung has claimed.

I've seen lots of people online saying the volume doesn't get very loud, or the bass isn't very good, but to be honest those people don't understand that Samsung phones has a built in sound optimizer. (This will not work for iPhone users). If you go into your phone settings you can make a sound profile specific to your ears, and you can turn on Dolby Atmos which makes these earbuds really shine. The bass isn't breathtaking, but it is definitely there if you listen to the right songs. The same goes for the volume, it is so loud that my parents were yelling to get my attention because I honestly couldn't hear them, and they were no more then 12 feet away, in a house at that.

I got worried when I purchased these earbuds and saw all the reviews online talking about their cons, like connectivity issues, and the mic sucking, but those aren't true either. Sure the mic isn't the best, but it's not as bad as some people are saying, it's as good as a landline phone if not better. As for the Bluetooth connection, I was 3 rooms away in my house without a single drop out, over 25ft with walls in-between.

My tip is if you have a Samsung phone, definitely get these, it's worth the price. If you have an iPhone, get them, but don't expect the same experience on your iPhone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After about a month, one of the buds becomes extremely quiet and unusable. I tried all recommended actions to fix it, but nothing did. Amazon was able to replace this original pair after having me return the broken set.

The replacement pair broke similarly, but I was outside the return window for Amazon, and Samsung only gave me directions to go and get it fixed myself at a repair store.

I didn't really expect it to be so difficult to hear people talking to me. You can turn on the ambient sound booster but it hisses. So you can't just wear them while you are in a social environment (or at the office). My solution was to wear just one.

The audio quality when playing music seems a little dull. The quality is on par with or below regular old cheapo earbuds. Perhaps I don't have them seated properly.

Sadly, one of the reasons I got these was for mobile gaming/media. Unfortunately, the latency is garbage. Audio is at least a half second delayed.

These aren't terrible or perfect, but there doesn't seem to be a useful fit for them in my life apart from hands free calling while driving.

The fact that the buds are touch sensitive and not buttons is a huge selling point. A prior set had buttons which would have to be pressed firmly for up to 5 seconds to activate menus. these are just a light press or tap.

This is from someone who has an iPhone, so maybe the app makes all the difference, in which case, Samsung is missing out on a huge chunk of their potential market by not having an iOS app.

First of all — the earbuds are heavy. This is going to happen, since unlike wired earbuds, they have to have the battery, etc. I was able to mostly forget about them, but after a while my ears began to ache. They provide you with alternative fins and buds, and I swapped through all of them trying to find a comfortable fit. I thought I had, and went to compare to my current (5€) earbuds — nope. The difference is stark and uncomfortable.

The sounds were flat at best, muffled at worst. I played around with the Spotify EQ for over two hours trying to get something that resembled reasonable sound. This is apparently where the app shines through, well. I’m not an audiophile by any means. I listen to music/podcasts 9 hours of my day, however, and this just doesn’t cut it. I

If these were 50$ buds, I’d give 4 stars. At more than double that, this doesn’t cut it.

Could not maintain a connection unless I held my phone in my hand at reading height.  I'm in tech for a living so I tried to see if there was something I could do to make these work right, but unfortunately even going into developer options on the phone and changing a bunch of settings there did not resolve the connectivity issues.

It came with 3 wing tips and 3 different sized ear tips making for the perfect fit in your ear.

The sound quality isn't anything to brag about but for wireless earbuds I'd say they are up there with the best, noise cancellation isn't too bad either it keeps just enough of the outside away but leaving a little bit to hear,  and if that isn't enough you can turn on a setting in the app that allows outside noises to passthrough the ear buds mic.

Of course there are cheaper wireless earbuds out in the market but for the most part, they will only last you a good 5 months before they die. While the pair of wireless earbud I had from Samsung last year are still going strong. The quality  sounds of the earbuds are good, but that also depends on how deaf you are cause some might disagree with how loud they get. The noise cancelling is already good and that should help with sound quality already. Also don't expect an amazing bass cause it definitely doesn't have it. They fit great in my ear and look great to while wearing them and they also come with other ear pieces to fit your ear. Overall they are exactly what I wanted and expected. Wish they had more bass in them but I'll look forward to they're next version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have these in on the subway to work and home playing music not even at max volume. The other day, there was an argument in the car next to mine, not even 20 feet away that involved the police once the train had stopped, and I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE BECAUSE OF HOW WELL THE NOISE CANCELLATION WAS. I only noticed since people were looking back and we hadn't moved, once I press and held to turn on ambient noise mode I could hear yelling. I took out my buds and chaos to my ears. I was standing there as this lady was screaming at the police and remember being super impressed at how I didn't hear anything going on with these in.

I've never had wireless buds before so I was scared of them falling out but they haven't and it's a snug but comfortable fit. I'm really impressed by the touch technology and I like how my music/videos will pause if I take them out of my ears. Battery life of the case is ok to me.

I use mines  jus for 2 hrs at the gym, 5 consecutive days without charging, so battery is no problem for this. It also holds up to heavy perspiration very well.
 They are the most comfortable headset i have ever used, period. Normally I cant keep anything in my ear very long. This seems to be the only exception. Won't be trading this for anything else.

I use earbuds for the gym, listen to music and watch video's while working out, so i wanted something that had noise cancelling.. these do that, sorta.. it comes with 3 different size gel tips..i had to put in the large ones, and even then, i have a difficult time getting a seal..so i moisten them before inserting which kinda helps..inserting and removing these are kinda difficult too, since they're 'rounded'..making it hard to grasp with the fingers..once in the ear though, you don't feel them at all! It's quite remarkable..and they stay put very well too. I have had connection issues though even though they are Bluetooth 5.0 and my phone is always in my pocket or no more than 2 feet from me at all times.. i have to go to Bluetooth settings and 'disconnect' them after each use or to reset them while in use, which is a pain in the butt.. the case is smooth and rounded, making it difficult to grasp when in a gym bag.. the battery life is superb though..kudos Samsung for that.. however, there is only one LED to indicate if the earbuds are 'set' in the cases cradle..i'd prefer two LED's, one for each ear bud... how do i know they're both being charged with only one LED? My biggest complain, and something no reviewer addressed (and i watched a ton of video reviews before purchase), is that there is no iOS app for these.. I can't see battery status, change EQ settings, or anything that the Android app can do. Why release a product for one format but not the other? I was assured they are working on one, but couldn't guarantee when it will be available.. I registered them on the Samsung site, indicating my OS in hopes of an alert when the app is available..i was told to keep checking back on the website..Really? For a tech company, that seems pretty prehistoric to me.. without the app, you're get pretty decent sound, although my $19 Anker soundbuds sound better..been a musician my whole life so sound quality is pretty important.. music and quality sound can inspire .. these kinda just are ""Meh""...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Galaxy Buds come in a nice sleek case that also acts as the charger, the case feels good in your hands and has a satisfying snap to it when you open and close it. The buds themselves are a good size and feature a removable wing tip to help them stay in your ear. The buds come with 3 different sized tips and two different sized wings as well as an option for no wing to fit your comfort. The actual sound of the earbuds is very good, with my work I have to scrutinize audio a lot so I'm always analyzing the sound of my headphones. The sound isn't perfect, but it is very good for its price point. Some drawbacks to the audio are that the base doesn't kick in fully unless you turn up the audio to near full and at times the audio can sound a little tinny. But again these are very small complaints, overall I am more than happy with these headphones and they are exactly what I've been looking for in a portable wireless pair. On the outside of each bud is also a touch panel allowing you to Play/Pause, Skip and Repeat tracks and also set up custom actions. The pairing process couldn't be easier for them.

I tried the Jabra Elite and the Apple Airpods, and this is hands down the best. I am frequently stopped on the street and people ask what brand my earbuds are. The Jabra did too good a job of noise cancellation, to the point that it felt so buried into my ear that they started hurting after 2+ hours in. The Airpods just fell right out.

The noise cancellation is okay, and the Hear Through ambient noise is a joke and I never use it.

The case is so small and a joy to hold.

By far these are the best looking, like futuristic bulbs in your ear. I opted for white so it was obvious to others that I had earbuds in.

Since my phone and smart watch are Samsung products I wanted my new headphones to be the same brand because of simplicity and compatibility. What I mainly use my earbuds for. 1.) Working out 2.) Listing to music 3.) Watching shows on my tablet 4.) Running or walking I’ve had many problems with previous headphones being in my way while working out. Thanks to the galaxy buds I don’t have to worry about annoying cords being in my way. This is a huge plus for me while I work out. The sound quality of the galaxy buds are amazing and don’t have any problems with clarity and also it is very easy to navigate through my music without any problems. While connected to my phone or tablet to watch TV shows and movies they are easily paired to both devices with out to much of a hassle. Another important quality that I look forward to in headphones is the ability to stay in my ear while I go out for a run or jog. They are very comfortable and don’t really cause my ears to hurt or feel any discomfort while I wear them. The Galaxy Buds are a great addition to anyone looking to upgrade there current headphones because I feel that they are a truly remarkable piece of technology that makes certain routines that much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is amazing, with five different equalizer settings. No scratching, popping, or snapping at all.

Add to that they are very small, no more looking like the Star Trek Communications officer with a monster thing sticking out of your ear. Touchpads are configurable, allowing you to turn volume up and down or use voice commands, for example.

If someone could find a way to merge these two products, I would be much happier.

The good:
-Battery life is actually quite good. I have yet to have the battery level warn me it was low, despite heavy use.
-You can use either headphone solo or together. A limitation of the Bose Soundsport Free is you need to use the right headphone, but cannot use the left headphone solo. The Samsung wins on that one feature.
- The charging case is small, easy to toss in a pocket and not notice. The case charges the headphones quickly.
-The ""find my earbud"" feature is excellent. It makes a loud chirping sound that is easy to hear across the room. The only way to improve it would be to add a sharp finish to the sound  at the end to help your ear focus on location.
-The profile when wearing it is the best I have seen on a completely wireless headphones. They fit snugly and have lots of sizing options.

The Bad
-They have an very limited range. Maybe 15' with clear line of sight.  Putting my phone in my left pocket while using only the right earbud leads to a choppy signal, at best. With the Bose, I can go 35' away with walls between my phone and the earbud and have clear, crisp sound. The shorter distance with the reception is probably something that helps the battery life on the Samsung over the Bose, but can be irritating.
-The sound quality is mediocre. Especially compared to the Bose. Acceptable for the gym and most activities, but if you are an audiophile, you will be frustrated with the sound quality.

Summary-
Solid package. I use them more than the Bose. The case is smaller, the individual earbuds can be used independently of the other, and the battery life if much better. The earphone block noise well, are intuitive, and fit well. The signal strength leaves A LOT to be desired. It is my biggest gripe, but not a deal breaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Buggy","My first ever wireless earbuds. Will be returning them and buying maybe trying another wireless ear bud set next. I charged them fully. Been using them for almost 4 hours now with my iPhone Xs Max. I know they're made for Samsung devices, but they're also advertised as being iOS compatible. 3 times now the left ear bud would stop working and play this constant loud buzzing sound like some mutant roided mosquito buzzing in your ear and it won't stop until I put them back in the wireless charging case for a minute or two. Not an instant fix. Just had them on for a 2.5 hour work out at the gym. It happened there twice, and again since getting home. Seems to happen on occasion, all 3 times, when a text message or Facebook messenger notification comes in.

Not acceptable. Will return them. I will say this though. The sound quality is nice, and my paranoia about them falling out of my ear has been squashed. I at first almost tried to get them to fall out, but they wouldn't! haha. Leaning over to the side for a minute. Hanging upside down for 30 seconds at the gym. 4 minute planks. I can feel the gentle tug of gravity on the buds as I got in various positions, but they didn't fall out. Not even once! I hope this helps!

It seems like I'll be returning them, HOWEVER....I use both the iPhone Xs Max, and Galaxy Note 8. Maybe I'll keep them for another 2-4 days and see if this same bug, with the loud buzzing happens on my Galaxy Note 8. If not....I MIGHT keep them for the long haul as I'll be upgrading to the Galaxy Note 10 where I can wireless charge them with that device. :)

So far, big thumbs down from my usage with my iOS device. I'll e-mail Samsung about the problem and see what they have to say.

No dedicated volume control -no two ears are the same, but I think they could've put a small sensitive button on top edge of each bud so you could change the volume. This makes sense at least with my ears.

Charging case lid is sharp -at first you don't really notice it until you start to see little rough patches on your thumb, I had to sand down the lid to deal with this, so the next version make the edge softer

Find my buds - This feature flawed, if anything touches the bud's ""in-ear dectors"" it will refuse to beep, which made it impossible to find the buds using this feature when they got lost in my blanket.

The case also charges wireless which works great with the Samsung wireless charger I use on my desk already. You can use one at a time or both. So far I've tried them listening to music and placing some phone calls, both sound great and clear. I tried the music and the calls using one ear bud and both. The ear buds over all are pretty comfortable in the ear and aren't terribly noticeable. The first time i used them i thought the volume was very quite, even with my phone volume completely turned up. I found these have an internal volume and just needed to be turned up. There is a nice app you can use to configure the buds to how you want them. I configured the touch button on the ear bud to adjust volume and simply just turned it up. The touch button can be used to play/pause music, answer/hang up phone calls, and skip and go back on music tracks, all in addition to the volume control i mentioned above.

My earbuds have pretty annoying connectivity issues with the Bluetooth dongle I have for my PC, but I'm going to try a different dongle before I judge them on that.
If your planning on watching many TV/Movies with them I would pass. They have some of the highest latency of all the wireless earbuds at 320ms and they don't feature the aptX low latency audio codec (unless you're exclusively streaming from a Samsung phone which apparently uses a lower latency audio codec). This translates to a very noticeable delay between peoples lips and the actual sound.
The earbuds are relatively comfortable. After 4-5 hours of having them in I do sometimes experience enough discomfort that it's obnoxious. Oddly enough, smiling or laughing while they're in can be pretty uncomfortable.

I would only recommend these if you're planning on using them exclusively (or at least mainly) for music during a workout or listening to podcasts around the house.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. The control buttons on the buds are easily activate just by touching either bud when inserting or removing from ears, activating different functions.
2. Range of Bluetooth is very short compare to all other buds I own.
3. Erratic behavior - I am not sure how to explain this but it's like watching 3D without glasses, 2 independent sounds coming out.
4. Screeching noise coming out of the left side. I had to leave the left bud in the car when I went to the gym.
5. The ambient noise sounds like you are in the toilet, and wind sound makes it worst.
6. Callers complaint on quality of the call.

They have been updated to the latest firmware.

I have until the end of May to return the earbuds and right now I am incline to do that. I am going to start searching for replacements.

The decision really boiled down to one key feature for me: fit.

Jabra:
These simply would not stay in my ear.  Ive got friends that swear by them, but the left bud just kept falling out (Im sure the unique shape of everyone's ears has a big role to play here).  I really wanted to like these buds as they were the highest rated based on my research, but if they can't stay in, their purpose is defeated.
I liked the app, the different sound modes, and the ability to customize how much ambient noise was let through.
Their controls, however, were by far the most fiddly to work with: I found myself pressing down very hard on the right bud (to the point of hurting my ear) trying to find the button.
If Jabra made a wingtip attachment for these, they would be SO much better.

Bose:
Bose's unique wingtips give a comfortable fit, but cause the buds to protrude from the ear far more from the other 2.  They also don't sit as deep into the ear canal as the other 2.  As a result, they let in FAR more ambient noise.  As I'd be using these primarily when doing outdoor yard work, sound isolation was important and these just didnt work for me.
Buttons were better than the Jabra's, but I found I had to grab the entire right bud to stabilize it when trying to push a button.

Samsung:
These were the perfect combination of what I was looking for.  A bud that fit deep in the ear canal to provide good sound isolation, but also came with wingtips to provide a secure fit.  I actually really like the touch controls: you can't perform quite as many functions as you could with the controls of the other brands, but I found it met my needs.

I didn't do a side by side comparison of sound quality because the fit essentially made my decision for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I thought it might be because of their most recent software update, so on the second pair I didn't let it update until after I tested with them. They worked the same disappointing way. I put my S10+ in developer mode and tried every Bluetooth codec available. They went from bad to worse, sometimes cutting out so long I thought my music paused.

I've been using my Level U for like two years but I've finally lost all of the rubber earbud covers and they're falling apart anyways so I decided it was time to buy some new ones.

It was decidedly easy to buy these as they are some of the cheapest truly wireless earbuds by a major technologies company out there (I've had mixed success buying off-brand earbuds) and I already have a Samsung phone so I thought it would just work out better. FYI It did!

It's so great to not mess with wires anymore but the one earbud at a time feature is another plus. I know that one of the major complaints is the sound quality, but I haven't seen many issues with it. For $130 the sound is incredible with decent bass. I think some people may expect Harman Kardon or Sennheiser level quality but then go out and buy one of their products then!

You will definitely notice these sit in your ear but with the different sized rubber rings and earpieces, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. That's the tradeoff for the tight fitting secure fit I guess. It does an amazing job canceling out external sound when both are in. One note is that the ambient sound feature does sound tinny in a smaller room because it picks up everything and does leave something to be desired.

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait to try them out on a run now that the weather is nice again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But what is that pesky, constantly recurring tone I keep hearing in the left earbud even when 100% charged.

I have had the IconX's for about a year now. So let me run though my list.

1. This is easily the best part of these buds: they are SUPER COMFORTABLE! I almost can't even tell they are there. I have been wearing them for hours (part of that time with a beanie on and part without). They are simply a joy to wear. A big upgrade from the IconX comfort which plenty to be desired. Also the fit on these exceed the IconX. I have a weird left ear canal and shape and never could get the IconX's quite right but the galaxy buds work perfectly. So if fit and comfort are the most important things to you then I highly recommend these.

2. Sound Quality - It's about the same as the IconX's despite being ""tuned"" by AKG. Volume is roughly the same. If the IconX's volume got an 8, I would say the galaxy buds get to 7.75. Bass is good enough as is treble. The mids are alright too; I'm not a huge audiophile but they sound very nice.

3. Noise Isolation - top notch; they filter out sound quite well. I will say the ambient sound feature on them is CRAP compared to the IconX's; the IconX's ambient sound was much better. If you care about that sort of thing.

4. Touch Response - its very touchy. If you press too quick it'll only register the first tap. So you have to slow down a bit and I don't like that cause the IconX's didn't need that. Plus remember that they removed the swipe up/down for volume controls (which I hate that they did that) so you are stuck with a tap and hold (right bud does volume up and left does volume down and NOPE you cannot remap this).

5. Software - IconX is winner here. They removed the tap and hold and it would cycle through your list of available options (like ambient sound on/off, voice command, start workout, etc) but as mentioned above they removed the swipe for volume. This is a huge step back Samsung.

6. Connectivity - I keep my phone in my front left pocket and my IconX's would very rarely disconnect/crackle for a moment or two. The Galaxy buds do it every single time I turn my head in any direction. I moved my phone to my jacket pocket and that essentially fixed it. That isn't viable for year round though; I hope Samsung fixes this with a software update as this is crap.

7. Battery - it's fine; but overall the IconX's would last longer in the long run as its case held more of a charge. However, the wireless charging case is nice. But I was fine with just the wired USB-C charging of the IconX's.

8. Long term frustrations - I cannot say as I haven't had the buds very long however the IconX's had this super annoying problem where ear wax would sneak its way into the canal of the bud and block most sound. You had to take off the screen, clean the canal, and replace with a new screen (thankfully supplied by Samsung in abundance). I don't think the GB's will have this issue but that remains to be seen. They don't include a repair kit with these so I'm assuming they don't expect it to happen.

9. They removed the internal 4gb of storage. Why Samsung, I used the heck out of that. I love going out for a run/jog and not have to take my phone OR smartwatch. I would pay for that; I think others would too.

With the removal of the volume swipe, the tap and hold scroll through list, lesser battery and sound that isn't any better than last year's model I'd have a hard time recommending these over the IconX model. The comfort, fit, smaller size, wireless charging case, and multiple color options are about the only things the new buds have going for them. I love Samsung products but this one isn't as good as I hoped it would be. It isn't bad either. YMMV.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Customer service just wants to pass my problem around from representative to representative without even knowing what to do to fix it. Great product save the battery issue...

Problem is, I'm between the largest and 2nd largest one, so it's either too tight, or slightly loose on my ear.  For the most part, they sound amazing.  I can barely hear the office around me at work, which is great.  Downside, occasionally there is interference, or a glitch type sound where volume seems to jump up and down for a split second, and sounds kinda digital.  Also, as far as sound quality goes, the dynamic pass through is crap, still have to pop em out to talk to coworkers.  Phone call quality is great, but it picks up A LOT of wind.  Wife kept complaining about it, but I couldn't hear the wind on my end.  They also have a matte finish that tends to show earwax, and dust/crumbs, whatever the heck gets on them when you put them down.  Lots of stuff sticks to them, and you'll start seeing earwax in your charge case as well. even if you wipe them off briefly before returning them to their case.  The real value with these buds is obviously using them with other  Galaxy products.  when i open the case, instantly pairs to my phone, same with my wife's phone, seamless.  App is really simple to use, and very informative.  One improvement would be if the app showed the actual charge of the case as well as the buds.  At the moment it only shows the charge of the buds themselves, case is shown by a light that turns on when you close it (green yellow or red).  Also connects to my Windows 10 laptop seamlessly, but has a little sound lag on videos.  Very hard to notice.

I use them with an iPhone. but prefer AirPods if im at home and alone.
These are good for walking out and about on campus if you want to ignore everyone.
the fact that they are noise isolating is why I got them. the wireless charging is a nice touch I didnt realize I would end up loving. They work well enough mostly...
but,
sometimes they randomly just start making this piercing ringing sound. which  cannot be stopped by pausing music or anything. the only way to remedy is to out them back in their case and shut it for a minute or two to wait for them to calm down.
would appreciate if mine could be replaced.... not sure if they are defective....?
and also, my only other complain is that they look kind of stupid. more stupid than AirPods I think.
my friend once asked me why I had olives in my ears...

also on iPhone the audio delay when watching a youtube video is INTENSE!!!! so thats not good. but doesn't bother me much. just shows that they are really intended for Samsung users obviously.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazon did not dissapoint on delivery.  2. The buds were a gamble. 3. After updating the software and fitting the buds, I can't complain.

At first, I was sceptical on the low range of sound, but honestly they're just good.

The mid and high are great off the rip.

Bass took boost from the wear app, but it is genuinely solid. We tried some Dr. Dre, some Clint Mansell, Halsey, Madonna, and GoT theme.

Fitted and ready, these are very nice.  They aren't going to blow out your skull, though.

My wife and I paired them almost simultaneously without hiccups and also sang together without a hitch.

The very best completely wireless headset we have experienced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Waste of money!","These are awful. An abomination to the Samsung line. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews

The things everyone was right about:
Terrible sound
Incredibly low volume
Awful microphone

No one could hear me on these and I could not dial them up enough to drown out noise.

Two things few people complained about was falling out of their ears (which happened to me within 30 minutes of working out), and having to install software. The software wants access to everything on your phone (contacts, GPS, network, messaging, call log) everytime I disconnected bluetooth and reconnected without having first put the buds back in the case, my S10+ would auto redownload the software. WHHHYYYYYY??!!!! I dont have to do that with any other bluetooth headphones.

The only positive is that these can be charged wirelessly from your phone.

For $150 you can grab some off brand Amazon buds and a pair of Powerbeats 3.

Avoid this product at all costs and save your money

I currently use Beats corded ear buds that constantly fall out of my ears. These Galaxy buds fit so snug and comfy. The sound quality is stellar and these buds are super easy to use. The Galaxy Wearable app is easy to use to set your bud preferences. You can volume up/down, change songs, answer phone calls and I especially like the ambient sound option, I use this at work so I can still hear my office phone ring or hear someone calling my name while listening to music. I have my left bud set to volume down and the right bud set up for volume up. The ""find my earbuds"" option is super helpful if your buds find themselves lost....on the app you can click this and the buds will start chirping like a lost baby birdie, and gradually gets louder.

You see, I got two pairs.  One came with my pre-order of the Galaxy S10+. The second pair were purchased after I thought I had lost my buds.

Both have some annoying connectivity issues. I swear they are terrible for a brand like Samsung and for the price of 130 dollars.  The sound is alright, the noise cancellation is ok, but only because the buds are thick enough and they are not open ended.  Meaning noise doesn't really leak.

Moreover, microphone quality is awful. Passable sometimes, but terrible when in a noisy environment.

Lastly, hear me out.  You don't want to get this buds.  They have horrible connectivity issues.  I mean horrible to the point of sound stuttering even when my phone is in my pocket.  I can't even go out for a walk without the audio cutting every minute.

The device has received multiple firmware updates. But so far the issues have not been solved.

I wanted to test the functionality of the headphones at home, work, and in between. I was really surprised at the sound quality. I did not expect such a broad range of sound from such a little device. The paring process was really simple while using the Galaxy S10. My phone recognized the buds as soon as I opened the charging case. Then I opened the Galaxy Wearable app and I was notified of an update for the buds immediately. I must say that the Galaxy buds are comfortable and stay in ear while walking, jogging or running. I didn’t experience the normal ear soreness from extended usage as with some other headphones. While listening to music, the Galaxy buds did a good job of removing background noise. I couldn’t hear much of my surroundings at all. Then, I tested the Ambient Aware feature while at work, and this was really useful. Most people did not recognize that I even had headphones in. The Ambient Aware feature allowed me to hear my surroundings by using the built in mic on the headphones. Portability is also a big plus. Being able to pop the Galaxy buds in and out and having a charging case is a useful tool to have. The charging case is vital at work too. I can get about 5 hours of music listening before having to charge the buds. The coolest feature is having the ability to charge the case and the Galaxy buds. I can get through a whole 9 hour office day having to charge the buds for a few minutes a day. Overall, I recommend the Galaxy Buds for anyone who wants a premium sound from affordable headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are definite minuses to both the Apple and Samsung ear pods. But I can live with the shortcomings of the Air Pods over these.

Things I did not like:

Fit: you have to twist them into your ear to get a solid fit, then there is the irritation (for me at least) of having something closing off your ear canal.

Sound: Was decent but not as good as I was expecting from pods that seal off your ear. I messed with all the sound settings and couldn’t get what I wanted.

Functions: The ambient surrounding setting did not work. Once music was playing I couldn’t hear anything around me. Music off you could tell the microphones were picking up sounds from around you but that seemed more like I had hearing aids in than anything.

I really wanted these pods to work for me, I had an open mind due to the feature of being able to charge wirelessly, hear things around you and they look sleek.

Huge difference. Having said that, these wireless buds are a ""best of breed"" product. I have a Samsung S10 and these pair perfectly with that phone. The app is great. Very easy to set up and use. They are extremely comfortable and can be worn for extended periods of listening. The sound quality is really, very good. I listen to a variety of music - admittedly not hip hop, and the depth of these buds is excellent. Bass is good - not thumping. Mids are spot on and the highs are clear without being shrill or tinny. Volume is loud. The maximum level will not make your ears bleed, but it's plenty loud. Noise cancelling is good - not great, but good is still ""good"". They do not compare to high end, over-ear head phones. They cost way less than high end head phones. So my verdict is; this is a great earbud for the price and a ""must have"" if you own one of the new Samsung smartphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like the TouchPad taps in order to answer/hang up or reject a call as well as raise or lower the volume.

They're great aside from one major flaw that Samsung can't seem to fix. I got mine about a month ago as a gift from my wife. About a little over a week later I started getting complaints from people I'd be talking to that they couldn't hear me over this weird loud chopping noise as per Samsung pro tech, so called 'electrical glitch""... Software was updated they had been reset, nothing helped. So I sent those back to Samsung, I got a replacement it was awesome to have people hear me decently well again... Until about a week later when these new replacements started doing this same thing, and apparently there's no software fix yet but unfortunately I'm not going to be sticking around for who knows how long to find out if they can get their shit together and fix the electrical glitch problem.

So all in all cool ear buds but this particular issue makes them pretty much worthless (when people on the phone can't hear you) if it happens to most of them. Therefore these  get a solid and generous 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, there are some drawbacks, one of them is the touch controls in the buds, they are not that accurate when I try to touch them twice and triple times they do not respond to this precisely. However, a single touch pause or starts the buds accurately as well as the long touch ones. My own opinion about the sound quality is that it needs to be better, the noise cancellation is just as like you are wearing the AKG wired earphones that comes with a samsung mobile, absolutely the buds sound better but with this matter it is just the same.

You can't have your phone in your pocket or a running belt and not have choppy audio.  Audio quality itself is very poor: very tinny and kinda hissy in nature.  It almost sounds like these are clipping at any volume level which makes listening to anything pretty annoying.  The passive noise cancellation nature is somewhat nice unless you want to do something like walk or run.  The internal sounds of your body get amplified so when your foot strikes the ground, you'll hear it very clearly.

Noise cancellation is not all too great, but once you turn the music loud enough, noise will be blocked. When these first arrived, my right ear would feel fatigue after about 10 min. After 2 days of constant use, my ears got used to them. The only issue I am now facing is random cutoff of sound. Sound sometimes will start to mess up when phone is in pocket. Another bad thing if you take out one bud and don't put it back in the case, then the sound will cut off from the bud in your ear. Overall, these are great for the price.

UPDATE: A day after I wrote this review, they ended up in the washer. On Friday the 13th. What a coincidence. Left bud is completely toast. Case is fine, but the right bud get hot when charged and the sound is muffled. The battery is also messed up.

I can still use a cable but that defeats the purpose! I am not a cave man, so i am not going back to those flinstone times. Sending in as defective.

Update: 2nd set of ear buds now drop calls whenever they feel like it. Going to return and ask for ANOTHER pair. I am still holding onto my faith for Samsung. I hope 3rd times the charm....hopefully

Sound quality is fantastic, but it can be subjective since I am not an audiophile everyone has different opinions. But in all honesty, they sound great, make sure you download the Galaxy wearable app that way you can tune the quality to your liking, I am a bass head so I have it on Bass Boost...

Bluetooth is solid, really good has incredible range, literally, I walked at least 50 close to 70 feet away from my phone and the connection remained strong, it started cutting out when I went further than that. So yes most of the effort definitely went for Bluetooth connectivity very reliable even with phone in pocket, and as soon as you open your pill case they start connecting immediately, not bad Samsung not bad at all....

so why only three stars you ask?

 Let me start off by saying that this review is not meant to sway you off your purchase, these are great you do get your money's worth, but, don't rely on it for phone calls. Phone calls are a hit and miss some people hear me nice and clear others have told me that i'm either too quiet or it sounds slur-ish, it works best in quiet places especially with both earbuds, the earbuds can work independently as well so you can use either the right ear bud only or the left it really doesn't matter. Voice assistant works too, if you say ok/hey google it will pop up, however, it doesn't always work and sometimes it cannot understand you, I find it best if you just change the tap-hold button for assistant but again sometimes it wont understand what you are trying to say to it, either bad mic quality or earbud design ...

But then here comes my second gripe, the touch controls on these are pretty frustrating, they are very sensitive for sure, single tap and tap-hold work just fine but double tap and triple tap are very annoying at times, they would register some times as a single tap, or a triple tap it gets confused, most of the time I just end up whipping out my phone to change tracks. I'm pretty sure this can be fixed with an update, you can change tap-hold to something else and you can also lock out the touch controls, but it locks out all of them, why? why not just lockout some of them not all of them at once? Also give us the ability to modify our tap controls any way we want, why is it limited to only tap-hold? it makes no sense Samsung, get on this man....

Overall, if you don't mind changing tracks with your phone, and you just want to listen to music these work great you wont be disappointed, but these small bugs need to be fixed, never tested the wireless charging ability since I do not have a wireless charging pad but I assume it works....","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Greatly improved design for sure. Much better fit and amazingly light weight. No discomfort after long term use. Which brings me to the point that long term use is possible with not only amazing battery life but the multiple convenient charging options. From the additional charge ability of the case itself, to wireless charging off your phone or pad, to simply plugging it in to the same usb C your phone uses. Sound quality is quite impressive for the compact size. Easy to adjust EQ levels create a great sound of your preference. Bass comes thru great without sacrificing clarity like other earbuds might. Call quality has been the most impressive. My callers cant even tell I'm using a headset. The noise cancelling has definitely improved in this model. ""Quick Ambient"" is probably my favorite new feature. with just a touch of one ear you can engage external mic and hear all around you. such a simple yet handy feature.

PROs
1) Does not stick out of the ears as much because they are more compact
2) Fit, at least for me is better than the Jabra's and by no-means were the 65t's a bad fit and that impacts sound quality and noise cancellation
3) Sound Quality I think is slightly better than the 65t's mainly because of the better fit. Bass is more than adequate and highs are clear.
4) USB C is a plus in my book
5) wireless charging is another plus
6) case is more compact than the 65t's
7) cheaper than the 65t

CONs
1) The app for the Galaxy Buds are not quite as good as the Jabra's. As it doesn't have a granular equalizer
2) Galaxy buds battery life is not quite as good as the 65t

Overall, the PROs out weigh the CONs, so I consider these ear buds better than the 65t. The 65t are still great ear buds and cutting edge for 2 years ago. However, today given the price, sound, fit and features, the Galaxy buds are better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The new Galaxy buds are a big improvement over the IconX. They sound much better and I actually can't handle full volume, in addition to that the battery life is longer although I have not worn them until they died to get a full run time. I usually spend about 2 hours at the gym and they last that entire amount of time and still have about 50% left of battery when I'm done with my workout. Also remember I don't use them at 100% volume so I'm not sure what that would do to battery life. A huge improvement is the comfort, I almost forgot that i'm wearing them as they fit snug but don't hurt. There are 4 options on sizing but my size was the one that they came in. Charging case is small compact and easy to handle. Overall these things are amazing and if you like doing active workouts with cords then you will love them. I have a Samsung Note 10 and the wearable app was a super simple set up.I'm still working on using all the bells and whistles but for me it comes down to great sound, comfortable and no cords!! #GalaxyBudInsiders #GalaxyBuds","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thinks like noise cancellation (which these don't actually do), isolation (which they do well), ambient noise passthrough, good battery life, and the like? Those are just nice to have.

The Galaxy Buds do a lot of those nice-to-have things, but they don't do the basics especially well.

Pros:
+ Great sound isolation (note: they don't have active noise cancelling)
+ Great battery life
+ Some fancy advanced features like ambient noise, equalizer, touch controls that work well, etc.

Cons:
- Connection quality is poor. If I keep my phone (a Note 9; another Samsung product) in my left pocket, and turn my head to the right, they will cut out. The connection is often static-filled even when the phone is sitting on my desk, five feet away, with a clear line of sight.
- Microphone stops working after a while. I have a lot of conference calls for work, where I'm often sitting on mute. If I need to speak later on in the call, I'll take the phone off mute, but the microphone has stopped working. I can disconnect the buds and use the phone speaker fine.
- Microphone quality is poor. I've had a number of complaints about my voice quality while using the Galaxy Buds. That didn't happen with my Airpods.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most of the features that had been represented for the product, which was why I got duped into buying them, were not there. The service representative was never able to find any owners manual, nor were they in the ""Quick Start Guide,"" which was all the service rep could find. He was never able to find a user manual for them and got as frustrated as I am. Don't waste time or money on these, they are total JUNK. We are going back to i-Phones and Skullcandy sound products. Life is too short for anymore of Samsung's nonstop inferior junk products and total lack of concern for customers. I don't know how they stay in business.

I have a Samsung Note 9 and these Galaxy Buds complement this phone flawlessly. When I place 1 or both buds in my ear(s) even if bluetooth isn't enabled Samsung technology working in true tandem pops up with that Galaxy Buds notification to ask Connect or Cancel. When paired you can use individually Left, Right or both at the same time. When you use the correct rubber ear peices included in the packaging they sound great. It does take a moment to place them and get them in that comfortable position in the ear but that's because these are so tiny and lightweight. Once they are in I forget they are in! The bass is strong, I don't know how you could expect more bass in a ear bud like this, I mean I love bass, I have 2 12"" Memphis subs in my car so I know bass. These have a great balance between bass and treble, just an all around quality sound. These are 100,000x better than those AKG wires headphones that come with Samsung phones like the NOTE 9 and other others. The sound may not be up to BOSE standard but it definitely sounds just like a quality movie theater to me. Quite loud too, I like my music loud and these deliver... maybe a little too well, will be trying to leave these below full volume for my ears sake. Also, the phone calling use with these buds is great. I work in the air on telephone poles and now I can seamlessly switch between music and phone calls with minimal effort. The people on the other end say they hear me great even though it is always windy and blowing right on these ear buds. I can see how if it was noisy like in a large city or event where thousands of people are all yelling around you these may pick up a lot of those voices but like I said it seems like it takes a lot to make phone call quality lack with these. If people like to whisper on the phone or attempt to make a call in a library without disrupting anyone, that might be a little tough because there is a certain low decibel level (normal indoor voice talking volume) these are tuned to work at. I am definitely pleased with these.

My 2 gripes:
1. The case itself is just plastic and I dropped it once, that was it scratched the case right up. Now I have paired this with the araree silicone bean sleeve and I'm good to go for work.

2. These cancel sound so well for tiny ear buds! Which can be a pro or con depending on what you use these for. People used to using Air Pods by Apple might have a tough time adapting to these if they decided to finally do the right thing and switch, lol. Air Pods are a pod style earphone which allows passive sounds to get into your ear along with the music. That open air gap between Air Pod and ear drum can be good and bad. Good if you're using at work and someone comes up behind you and tries to have a full conversation with you while you don't even see they are there. Galaxy Buds cancel outside sounds which can ruin the overall theater-like sound experience when watching movies or listening to music, but obviously makes it tough to hear anyone unless you leave ambient sound on. Ambient sound is a great feature to help with this issue but I think it could still use some improvement.

Overall worth the price and I am very pleased!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Knowing what Samsung is capable of and the high price tag, I did expect much more in terms of quality.

PROS:

Comfort - The buds fit extremely well in the ear and just twist right into your ear canal. I wear them when working out and after a while you almost forget they're in your ear.
Preface, make sure you figure out which size ear tips works best for your ear, it'll make a huge difference in fit and sound quality

Battery Life - The buds themselves last relatively long, about 5 - 6 hours on their own, and then the charging case holds a strong charge to juice up the buds. They recharge pretty quickly and the indicator lights on the inside and outside of the case are useful for determining when the case is charging, the buds are charging, when fully charged, and when low on battery.

Set Up & Pairing - Similar to Airpods, these were designed to pair well with their parents company's phone. So when using a Galaxy phone, the buds pair extremely well. As soon as you open the case and plug the buds into your ear, your phone should pair with them immediately (even if bluetooth is off). You can start playing music or make a phone call immediately. Initial set up was quick and even with an update, took about 5 min.

Sound Isolation - When listening to music, I can barely hear anything going on around me. Even at the gym, I can't hear the music that's blasted through their speakers.
There's an ""Ambient Sound"" mode to help you hear things around you, but I tried it in my office and it didn't work too well. Cool concept though.

CONS:

Audio Quality - Even with the dynamic sound tuning you can adjust in the Galaxy Wearables app, the sound isn't as rich and full as I've gotten from other headphones... My $20 JVC marshmallow headphones sound much better to be honest. Bass is pretty neutral though. This is where I expected the most in terms of quality and unfortunately it's not the greatest listening experience for $130. It's not terrible at all, but it's not amazing either

Connectivity - I'm using these on a Galaxy S10 so I'm running the most modern, up-to-date version of Bluetooth connectivity and I was relatively disappointed in how volatile the connection was.
I was doing a floor exercise at the gym and my phone got pushed up to my leg briefly, during which the audio cut out and scratched as if I had damaged something.
It's only happened once so far, but during a phone call, the earbuds desynced after a few minutes so the receiving voice on the phone echoed for me. I had to hang up and call again to have the buds sync the audio again. The phone was right next to me as well.
I'd say you can go about 20ish feet away safely from your phone before the Bluetooth connection starts to get really volatile and unreliable.

Glitchy - Ever so randomly, the sound will get completely distorted like a bad dubstep song... Not sure if it's a software issue or a Bluetooth issue but I've had it happen a few times just sitting listening to music with my phone right next to me.
Additionally, the equalizer tuning or volume of the music will change randomly sometimes.

Touchpad - The touchpad controls take some getting used to because they can be super sensitive or the exact opposite. Once while I was on the phone, I had to scratch my ear; I accidentally touched the side of the earbud and it ended the phone call. Conversely, I'll tap the bud twice multiple times to advance a song, but it won't register. So I'll have to put more pressure on the buds to make it work. A simplified way to do volume adjustments and have voice assistants work simultaneously would have been nice, but you can only choose to have one or the other.

In-Ear Recognition - One of the cool things about other wireless earbuds is that they'll recognize when they are in your ear and they will pause or continue music depending on the action. The Galaxy buds recognize when they're in your ear, but there is no option to pause if you take one of the buds out of your ear or to restart music when you put them both back in. Don't know if that can be added with a software update but it's a nice feature to have.

OVERALL:

The Galaxy buds will get the job done and they're cheaper than most other higher end wireless earbuds. But they could definitely be much better. Hopefully with continued software updates they'll improve over time. But if you're looking to spend $130+ on wireless headphones, I'd shop around, especially if you don't have a Galaxy phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can wear these hours on end with no discomfort and these stay in my ears.  The Jabra's are not quite as comfy and I can't stop the right ear bud from falling out when I'm active.  The Galaxy Buds touch controls are not as slick as Jabra's though.  Jabra's work every time and their application offers a 5 band eq.  I like to set the Galaxy Buds presets to dynamic to get the best sound.  The Galaxy Buds having a case that allows wireless charging and use of the newer C type USB connector is very nice.  In spite of their weak points I'm giving these 5 stars due to sound quality, all day comfort and staying in the ear.

Regardless if you're using a samsung device or not. If you're using a samsung device the likelihood of sync issue goes away, but you still have connection issues.

I cannot go ~20 minutes before my stationary head at work starts to experience audio skips. I don't move when it start happens and it eventually resolves itself. You can force this to happen by covering both of your ears with your hands and the left should go out. So, when you think about how much of your body is in between your right ear and a phone in your left pocket and you're out of luck. Simply unusable for any amount of time.

if the device is not a samsung device the issue happens and has sync issues. It'll be small at first, you'll hear one clip in the audio and all of a sudden the left earbud is a full second behind so you hear double the audio. There is no way to fix this without taking out both earbuds and placing them back in the case, closing it, waiting 5 seconds, opening it, waiting for it to pair, realize it doesn't automatically pair and you have to delete the previous paring and repair it, then place them back in your ears only to have it happen a couple hours later or the next day. Overall a very bad experience and don't know why this product has such a high rating.

My experience has been using a Surface, Note 8, and Macbook, they all experience the same issue regardless of distance to the buds, even being in line of sight of the device & within 2 ft.

Edit: The replacements suffer the same problem and the update released within the past day (1.35) doesn't fix the issue. It actually made the issue worse. I'm still using my Macbook and the ear (closer to the macbook) will lag and delay itself to make the music in phase. Love it!

I like these as I can wear them all day, the battery life is great and they're super comfortable.  Sound wise I would say they're not as good as Apple's airpods but the difference is marginal.  I like the look of these a lot more than anything comparable on the market.  They're not as bulky as some other wireless headphones on the market either.

I mainly use these when I'm working in the office and when I'm listening to various podcasts.  I wouldn't buy these if you were looking for the best sound quality.

Awesome earbuds, great sound quality.

Wish you could customize what the single and double tap features do and not just the press and hold feature.

Not a big fan of the ambient noise feature, doesn't sound natural at all.

Battery life is great unless you are using ambient sound for anything more then occasionally.

Comfortable! They go in and STAY in. Touch features are responsive. Case is solid and charges earbuds quickly.

(Not really, but kinda)","The buds are a pretty good package and offer mid tier sound quality with respectable noice cancellation and ambient sound detection.
However, I have to knock 3 stars off because of one glaring issue.
I purchased these specifically to be used while working out, and as long as your phone is not moving and you are not moving, they work fine. As soon as you begin to move (with the phone in your pocket), walking/running/cycling immediately you will experience issues with the buds desperately trying to disconnect from the phone. Not only with you have consistent issues with the sound cutting out or having weird compression sounds. But literally as soon as I stop moving and get the phone out of my pocket, the sound returns at full quality.
After my most recent run, my left earbud ended up disconnecting entirely and only my right earbud was connected.

There are cheaper options that work better and have better sound quality, such as the mPow Cheetah (or similar products) which makes it very hard to recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am impressed with the battery life and unlike the previous version I can charge these and wear one then whenever it dies the other one is still fully charged and the case still will completely recharge the other one....The battery doesnt drain when not in use and that's a huge factor for me.

The proximity sensor in the left bud doesn't work so it thinks that only one bud is in and the ambient feature is disabled unless both buds are in your ears.  Huge deal breaker. I've placed an order for a replacement and will update the review accordingly, but after a quick Google search it looks like this is an extremely common problem with no solution.

Sound quality is great and they are very comfortable so far.

UPDATE:  Got the second pair and the proximity sensor works on this pair.  However, the ambient sound feature leaves much to be desired.

Day 30: ?","Will do an update on day 30 and whether ive decided that i want to keep them or not.

Day 1 of using these wireless buds.
These are my first pair of truly wireless headphones. $130 is not little for me so I have watched every video review and read every article out there.  I was very skeptical because of the bad microphone reviews everybody gave it, as my MAIN USE for it is phone calls. Did multiple calls through out the day with no problems with sound or the other party not hearing me. Have had some issues with connecting them to my laptop and the left earbud stopped working for a while, but i think that was related to the case running out of battery cuz i connected and started using them right out the box didnt plug them in at all. There was weird static in the buds while connected to the laptop, none of that while connected to the phone tho. So that might be from my laptop idk. Again ive had these for only one day so far.
Initial impression is so far so good. Very impressive noise cancellation and GOOD sound quality. Very light in the ear, can wear them for extended amount of time with no fatigue. Glad they had replacement ""wings"" as what comes on by default didnt sit good with my ear so those come handy. Case is very small and easy to carry around.

They fit in my ear very well and come with adjustable ear insert thingies to fit different ear shapes/sizes. They case/box they come in also double as a charger which can charge wirelessly. I have been vigilant of other wireless earbud wearers and these seem to be fairly low profile in comparison. The sound quality is pretty good.

You would think that the sound would be better but it isn't.  It sould relatively low even on medium volume, which I dont like. My major pet peeve is the earpieces in general,  it's not comfortable.  Their good for jogging but after awhile the earpieces from the earbuds make your ears hurt. For the price, I'm disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I came to realize this is just a limitation of the technology (Bluetooth 5.0 and older), and *not* of these Buds. When used outside in an open area with the phone more than several feet away (hitting golf balls) and with no nearby walls to bounce off and redirect en route to the Buds, the BT signal can essentially get lost into the air. This ultimately happened with *all* BT headsets I tried under these conditions. But overall, these Samsung Galaxy Buds offer great, rich sound, clarity & bass, and fit nicely in my ears without falling out while weight training or running. Features like noise-cancelling and the ability to program the buttons (in a limited capacity) using the Samsung Wearables app, make these the best BT earbuds I have tried.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is my first totally wireless pair though. That part I love! The Galaxy Ear Buds connect very easily, have nice software features and work great with my Note 9.
They are almost perfect!
However, I still have the same problem with these as I've had with all wireless buds... little disconnects and stutters. It seems if you hold your head still and look straight forward, these keep a great connection but if you turn your head or look down much, it seems they break up some. I've been trying to pinpoint it but have yet to find a pattern.
While they work almost flawlessly, the sound and comfort of these are fantastic! My only complaint is the losing signal part. It doesn't happen a lot but enough to be annoying.
So, if you've had that problem in the past with ear buds or wireless in general, I don't think you will find these much different. The big difference in these is the easy setup with the phone, the instant connection when you pull them out and put them in and the sounds quality which I find to be pretty dang good. I think the price is pretty good too.  I just wish someone could tame the disconnect/stutter beast with wireless!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What's the point of wireless headphones if you have to hold your phone?  The second issue was the sound quality people experienced on the other end of my calls.  I was told often that I could not be heard or that there was a loud jackhammer sound.  On my end the sound quality was decent and I did not hear any of these jackhammers noises, but it was reported by multiple people on multiple days, so it wasn't a one off situation.

I have $20 headphones with better bass than the Galaxy Buds. Also, I notice that these earbuds hurt my inner ears after wearing them for over half a hour.

I own a Galaxy S9 and have tried my friends airpods but they immediately fall out of my ears. I was choosing between these and the Jabras as other high rated pairs (Bose, BO, Sennheiser) are too expensive for me to justify buying.

These have very good sound quality, the bass could be slightly more pronounced but is more than good enough with the largest ear tips (I am waiting for comply to release some foam eartips for these). With my Galaxy S9, I have minimal connection issues (skipping or synchronization problems do happen but rarely, I think this is pretty much an unavoidable problem for bluetooth earbuds. However, when using them with my laptop I do experience occasional connectivity issues, twitch in particular seems to leave cause the audio to desynchronize though this seems to have improved over the last few updates. They are reasonably comfortable, though it did take my ears almost a week to adjust and stop hurting, the smallest wings helped with this. Although this wasn't a problem for me, I have seen many users complaining about very quiet audio because they did not realize the buds have independent volume, this could be clarified on Samsungs part. When my volume is shared between my phone and buds, they are way more than loud enough, however, for some reason, the volume scale is not linear, if I lower the volume past a certain point, it drops drastically making find adjustments in this range harder. If I set the buds to have independent volume, this problem goes away. Battery life is very good, and my case does not appear to appreciably drain when left unused. The battery indicators on the case could be improved.

Overall, the main deciding feature for me choosing this over the Jabras is USB-C, unifying my phone, headphones, and laptop charging, and the size of the case. From what I understand, the buds do not work as well with non-galaxy phones (different codec and connectivity) so if I had another phone I might have still chosen the Jabras. However, these earphones are comfortable, convenient, sound great, and IMO worth the $130 price tag.

Edit:
A software touchpad has greatly improved the touchpad responsiveness and added a toggled option for ambient mode. This toggle is a great addition as one gripe I had was having to frequently launch the app to re enabled ambient mode.

So I researched and bought a handful of other true wireless earbuds, all being extremely uncomfortable.

Fast forward to a few returns later, I stumble upon these Galaxy Buds. I was really skeptical about using them on IPhones because they are clearly meant for Samsung, but I bought them anyway. I am blown away by these little things.

They have excellent noise cancellation, so much so that I wear only one if I need to hear anything around me. Yes, you can just wear one bud with the other in the case (big plus). The size is small and comfortable with 3 sets of tips and fins to make it fit anyone. And the sound is great, despite not being able to use the EQ settings only available on Android. This hasn’t been a problem since Apple Music has even more EQ settings already.

So, if you have an IPhone but you don’t want AirPods, these will not let you down. Even the touch controls are better than AirPods.

I particularly like the fit, as the in-ear design both keeps them secure and blocks out noise. They’re also very light which means you can wear them for long periods of time without worrying about discomfort. The small size means they also don’t look odd shoved in your ears like some competitors.

Sound quality is decent, but won’t blow anyone away. My biggest issue, however, is that I consistently have connection problems while walking. I can use these without issue while working out but if I use them while walking on my lunch break (in a city) I’m met with lots of dropouts and interference. I have to hold my phone above my waist for a consistent connection. Thus far I haven’t figured out what causes the interference as it doesn’t happen in other situations (gym, home, airplanes/airports, etc.)

Still, despite the issues while walking I’m generally happy with these.

EDIT: After a recent firmware update I’ve had far fewer connection issues so my biggest issue has pretty much been taken care of. I’ve adjusted my review to 4 stars as a result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I heard about them and read the reviews, I thought they were exactly what I was looking for. Small, good battery life, and high quality sound. While it is each of those things, they unfortunately do not fit. The three sizes of ear tips that come with the buds are all around the same size, and it was actually difficult to tell the smalls from the mediums at first glance. The problem stems from the size of the speaker under the tip. It alone is about 5 mm, which when the tips are put on, results in it being a very tight fit. My ear holes are very narrow and after about 1/2 hour wearing these, they start to ache. At one point I left them in for about 2 hours and hadn't adjusted them, and when I went to take them out my ears were extremely sore and it felt like someone was pinching them with pliers. I tried comply foam tips, but the rubber ""core"" was still big enough to be putting an uncomfortable amount of pressure on my ears. This likely doesn't apply to a lot of people, but if you have small ears, you should probably look elsewhere.

The sound quality is pretty good, although the bass seems a little weak given the price. Also, I don't love that they are so dependent on the equalizer in the app to sound good. The sound without the equalizer on is honestly pitiful. I have an android, so for use with my phone it's alright, but it's just a hassle. The headphones shouldn't be so dependent on an app.

The software also has some other annoying problems, like the fact that the ambient sound mode automatically turns off upon removing 1 bud. I like to have the ambient mode on so I can hear if someone comes to talk to me at work, but I am not going to leave them while speaking to the person. If I take even one bud out, the ambient mode get turned off, and I need to go back into the app to turn it on again. That's another thing: the hold to turn on ambient mode only triggers a temporary ambient mode. I would have much rather had it be a toggle of the ambient mode, or at least have the option. Also, having ambient mode on adds a constant static sound, making me wish there was a way to set a threshold for how loud something has to be to come through. Overall the ambient mode seems very poorly integrated, almost like it was added as an after thought.

Something that I do like that you don't see that often is that there is no main bud. I can alternate between the buds at will and put one back on to charge. They are also very attractive and I like they way they look when I'm wearing them.

As a whole, I don't see these being worth the $130 as is. If you can get them for <$90, and you don't have very small ears, I'd say they are probably worth the purchase. For me though, they just don't seem worth it. One of the points in getting wireless buds is to have a seamless experience, and having to take them out every 20 minutes to let my ears rest, and then needing to turn ambient mod back on completely defeats the purpose.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They work well with the galaxy s8, which for a phone has terrible Bluetooth performance (I don't know why, but Samsung is terrible with Bluetooth on most of their phones, like they really don't know what they're doing... luckily, a different part of Samsung makes this high quality Bluetooth headphone!) The buds never drop a connection, you can use either one at a time (an oft requested feature of many buds), they make a good seal with the ear and block ambient noise well. They auto turn on and off as you remove from or place them in their case. The case is top notch, and tiny enough to fit in your pocket. Basically its slightly larger than a car key fob. So 5 stars for case design and portability. A million times better than airpods. Oh, and it charges wirelessly! Pretty nice. The sound is good. I'm knocking a star for sound quality because bass response sucks - dont get me wrong, its in line with all other wireless buds, and sound quality is near the upper end of the spectrum of wireless buds, and that is no where near wired phones by a country mile. But the ""equilizer"" in the app is flat BS. Turning up the bass actually just turns DOWN the treble response, rofl (listen closely). I dont know who they're kidding with that joke of an equilizer. Also, taking calls on this works well, but you're not going to want to. When you talk, you're going to feel your voice vibrate your brain and reverberate in your skull due to the fit of the bud in your ear. It's just an unpleasant thing you won't want to do too often, but works in a pinch. In a nutshell these are for listening to music and not really for taking calls, and that's very fair. In sum, good buds with a secure fit, good seal (million times better than air pods), and good sound (not great sound. good for buds, that is)!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd live with that but the disconnects while running are unacceptable. For what it's worth, my first pair of buds come up as BC33 in my bluetooth settings and the second as C335; I was hopeful that the latter would be an improvement but so far it really isn't.

UPDATE: Outdoors, these connects regularly but randomly in both the crowded city and alone by the waterfront; also, the left and right buds, used separately, both disconnect, i.e. there's no improvement if one is ""closer"" to the phone, which is in my jacket pocket.

VERDICT: Unacceptable. Samsung has designed a good product but failed to deliver on its potential: stopping to reconnect three or four times in an hour is ridiculous and simply does NOT happen with Airpods, whether using Android or iPhone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was preparing to buy another set, but realized that the new Earbuds had just been released.  As with the 2018 Iconx, they were really easy to connect without issue.

In comparison to the 2018 IconX, the chargin/carrying case is noticeably smaller & lighter, which i definitely appreciate when putting them into my pants pocket.  The case still feels very solid.  In addition to the case being smaller, it feels as if the actual earbuds are slightly smaller and lighter.  I don't notice them in my ear, and yet, they definitely feel secure (not as if they are going to fall out.  This wasn't an issue with the 2018 Iconx either).

The sound seems to be the same (excellent) with good bass and maybe a bit louder than the 2018.  I had found the 2018s were also really good at noise cancellation and so are these.  Note that to change the bass and treble options (as well as other options), you need to download the Galaxy Wear app to your phone.

Definitely happy with my purchase!

I received the  Galaxy Buds when I purchased an S10.

The sound of the earbuds are all pretty on par.  Perhaps the Buds are a little better.  I know that when I have my music on half volume I cannot hear my family much.

The new Buds are much more comfortable than my old IconX.  My left earbud always became sore quickly.  When I put these buds in they fit comfortably and I can use them for a long time.  They're smaller than the IconX.

Sure, you can't swipe to do volume anymore.  But you can configure them so that if you touch and hold one ear it goes up and down for the other.

Overall, I like them better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They said the solution is to reset the earphones using the app, but the app is only available on android devices and I use these on my iPhone.

Pros:
- great fit
- personally I like the way they look, very minimal and do not pop out of ear much

Cons:
- ambeient noise control not available unless u have an android device. This was very disappointing because it advertised the feature heavily. Pretty strange that you can’t activate a bunch of features that are in the hardware because u don’t have the app for it.

YES, unless…","I had IconX 2018 for about 1.5 years and got new Samsung Galaxy Buds a week ago. Here is my first impression: The size and weight of S-Buds are about 30% smaller, while the battery life is about 1 hour longer and AKG did a great job on tuning the sound. No doubt, the sound quality of Buds is superior to IconX. The bass level and volume are about the same, but Buds are much cleaner, crisper, and more balanced. When compared side by side, IconX sounded muffled and dull. Based on those criteria, it’s certainly worth to upgrade to S-Buds or have them both for different purposes, see below.

HOWEVER, if you use IconX for sports and don’t want to carry your phone around, Buds don’t support this functionality: 1) No build-in storage, that is no autonomous MP3 listening, only Bluetooth streaming through a connected phone 2) No sports functions such as fitness tracking, guidance, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

PHONE CALLS! these buds are horrible for phone calls unless you are at home laying in your bed with zero noise around you!

The ""dual mic technology"" is useless you will never be able to have 10 seconds on a call if you are at a store, a restaurant, at the gym, etc. I know some people will say there is a time and place for phone calls but some of us have calls we need to take at any time any place and these are not reliable for that. My brother uses Airpods and I can hear him 10x better than these.

Next is the audio, what can I say it's ok at best. The volume levels are below average and always leave me wanting more. Bass is acceptable, the mids are ok, and highs are ok. I dont really get the clarity I like and the bass is too messy for my taste. I do own several high end IEMs and headphones so I am extremely picky.... not to mention audio is extremely subjective.

Battery is amazing.

Ergonomically these are good.

Unfortunately due to the microphone quality and volume levels I can not reccomend these, if the microphone issues can be resolved with a firmware update I would give then a pass until then I would say skip them unless you really want buds for an Android.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They dont seem to have a ""master bud"" like some sets do, you can just take out 1 and use that one and then take out the other when the first ones battery dies. When you just use 1 bud then the long press volume only does what that bud is programmed to do, for example if I just use the left bud the long press will only turn the volume down and if I use the right bud the long press will turn the volume up. When using just 1 bud your media pauses when you take it out, if you use both then you have to take both out for it pause, or just tap once on the touchpad of either bud. Doesnt automatically play when you put them back in, you have to tap the touchpad to play.
MAKE SURE HAVE THE RIGHT TIPS IN AND HAVE THEM AS DEEP AS POSSIBLE FOR OPTIMAL SOUND QUALITY
SUPER EASY SETUP: on my s9+, just make sure you have the samsung wearables app. Auto connects when case opens if you have bluetooth on.
 AMBIENT NOISE: mode is kind of weird, probably not best in class but could be improved through software update. But you could definitley hear cars and loud voices if you have ambient mode turned up (only works when you have both buds in ears) There is an update you need to install when you connect for the first time that takes about 2 minutes.
3 different size buds and fins included. Wireless charging works on highpower and low power charging mats not just on the back of an s10 device, usbC charging also available.
Tiny wireless charging case, weak magnets hold the buds in and guide them to the charging pins, you can shake the buds out if you have the case open, stronger magnets hold the case closed in your pocket, good and solid clicky case, satisfying to open and close.
 CUSTOMIZATION: You can customize the ""long press"" on the touch pads to turn volume up and down, turn on ambient mode or activate the digital assistant of your choice.
UI: No buttons, just a touch pad that is very responsive and it has sensors to know if they are in your ear and the touchpad doesnt work unless they are in your ear so you wont accidentally change your music when you take them out. Touchpad can be impeaded by hair over your ear. These buds and the case are tiny, you could probably hide them if you have long hair. Be sure you like tight fitting in-ear buds, everyones ears are different.
SOUND: If you arent an audiophile they are great, I personally dont see much of a difference in any earbuds no matter the price, they do sound alot better the deeper into your ear you can put them. They dont seem to get ear bursting loud but they do get very loud, good bass punch.
No onboard storage like the iconx.
BATTERY: I have not ran them to their limits yet but while using just one bud I listened to 5.5 hours of podcast (mostly voice) at about 35% volume and after the 5.5 hours the bud still had 40% battery left. When that ones battery runs out you can switch to the other by just picking it up and putting the other one in the case to charge.
INSTANT PAIRING: when you open the case and have bluetooth on they connect in less than 10 seconds, I have not had the little pop up window show up like in the ads but they instantly connect when you have bluetooth on.
Great purchase if you like in-ear style buds, kind of like ear plugs. Most features only available on Android, Samsung phones apparently work best though, Iphone works with basic features and siri.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Be warned!","I'm using these earbuds with a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and they work great! No connection issues or loss of connection when at the gym, walking around, or anything. The sound isolation is great; however, the ambient sound mode is a bit finicky. I was able to hear people if they were speaking on the same side as the earbuds AND if my music was at a medium volume (instead of being loud enough to drown everything out). If my music was too loud, I can't hear anything, even when ambient sound is put to max WITH voice amplifier. Furthermore, this product works best with Samsung phones. I used them on my MacBook bro and the sound got kind of choppy when watching Hulu. All in all, they work with any sort of device, but they work best (with no issues) if used with Samsung products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The two biggest pros of the Buds are the truly wireless nature of the Buds and the in-ear perfect fit. The idea of not having to worry about cables is an obvious feature of the Buds and boy is it great! That fact plus the comfortableness of the Buds makes this a good investment.

Pro: Feel. The fit/feel of the Buds is very comfortable and comes with adjustable parts to change the wingtip or eartip size. Upon first trying on the Buds the wingtip clips into your ear so that they do not fall out easily. The wingtip edge makes sure that it fits snug into your ear- perfect for working out or if you are nervous about the Buds falling out. If you are not comfortable with the feel of the Buds, you can simply change the sizing with the interchangeable eartips and wingtip- or if you don’t want the wingtip there are tips without the wings.

Pro: Simple Use. After pairing the Galaxy Buds and using them for a while, one of the coolest features of the Buds is the touch navigation of the Buds. Tapping once on the Buds will pause whatever you are listening to. Other navigational options are: Play, volume control, and answering calls. Also, the Buds can sense when you take them out of your ear and they automatically pause and will resume upon placing back into your ear. If you don’t like the settings for the touch menu it can be changed on the app. The other simple use is the charging. It uses the same USBC charger as the newer Samsung phones and is compatible with wireless charging pads. I haven’t had to charge them much- the battery life has lasted me pretty long stretches.

Pro: Easy Pairing. The Galaxy Buds are Bluetooth enabled and paired with my Samsung Galaxy phone easily. It is set up through the Galaxy Wearable app, (which was recently updated to include a hub area for the headphones). This is the same app that connects to the Gear watch, so if you already have it then great. If not, you can easily download it from the app store. Through the Galaxy Wearable app you can check the battery percentage of the Buds, adjust the sound through an equalizer, change what the touchpad responses are, manage notifications, a “find my earbuds option, and (my favorite) the ambient sound option. The ambient sound option allows you to hear your surrounding while you play audio through the Buds. This is perfect for situations where you want to listen to music but may need to hear your surroundings- like going on a run outside but wanting to hear your surroundings for safety reasons.

Con: Although the ambient sound option is a convenient mode to use it has its cons. The ambient sounds option makes the volume low and turning up the volume all the way does not seem to help. Also, during days when it is windy, you hear the wind more than you hear the music. The ambient sound mode is a great option to use but Samsung needs to improve the sound quality.

Pro: Good Use For library. I primarily used the Buds in the library, and they are perfect for college students looking to tune out their surroundings during studying. The ambient sound mode actually worked great here. I was able to concentrate on studying while having the volume low and still being able to hear my surroundings.

Overall, the Galaxy Buds have a great feel, are easy to use and pair, and have quite a lot of customization options. I recommend for the price!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Otherwise, I would have been pissed if I paid extra for them. The eadbuds do not sit securely in the ear. They can fall out quite easily. The ""simple controls"" are incredibly buggy. Any sort of overhead movement (like working out) leads to accidental touch input. Two double clicks is difficult to control at best. Three clicks is nearly impossible. Sometimes the headphones don't differentiate from a long press or a single tap. The battery life is really good, but that is about it.

I tried a bargain brand $40 dollar set, and couple others around the same price range made by other name brands.  In my opinion the Jabre Elite 65t had the best ambient sound functionality as well as while playing music, but they were not very comfortable for me.  On the other hand the Samsungs are sooo comfortable and they sound good as well.  That includes music and phone calls.  Everyone I ask while on calls say it sounds good.

This is our family's SECOND pair of Galaxy Buds using Samsung Galaxy S9+ and LG G7 ThinQ).  Both pair of Galaxy Buds have been in regular use on two different flagship phones. The first set of Galaxy Buds was purchased through Costco and the second pair were from Amazon.
We are relatively disappointed in Galaxy Buds vs PowerBeats 3.
Sound:
Music (especially bass) with Galaxy Buds is not nearly as good as PowerBeats 3.  If you are using Galaxy Buds for movies, phone calls, voice audio or do not prefer much bass, they may be a good option.
Reliability & Ambient Sound:
Galaxy Buds have had multiple updates in the few weeks that I've used them and they are still VERY buggy.
""Ambient Sound"" is a significant reason why I purchased Galaxy Buds in order to gain some safety and awareness while exercising outdoors.
After multiple updates, the Ambient feature will still randomly turn itself off and require the Galaxy Wear app to be opened on the phone and the feature re-enabled. This is not always an easy fix while in the middle of an intense workout.
Ambient Sound automatically turns off when either bud is removed from your ear and it does NOT turn back on until it is enabled MANUALLY, EVERY TIME from the Galaxy Wear app on the phone.  This becomes very annoying, very quickly.
Another shortcoming of Ambient Sound is that the loudness of the Ambient Sound is configured from the Galaxy Wear app but the Ambient Sound volume does not increase with the volume of music or other content. So the result is that we are only able to hear ambient sounds around us when the volume of music or content is Very low.  I usually increase the volume a bit during workouts and any benefit of ambient sound around me is immediately lost.  This should be easily fixed via software update but remains an outstanding issue.
Buggy:
There are still occasions when Galaxy Buds will produce digital ""static"" as if they were too far from the phone but the phone will be sitting unobstructed and within arms reach.
Galaxy Buds Bluetooth distance is a few steps away from the phone vs 30' or more with PowerBeats.
Fit:
Galaxy Buds fit is very good while exercising, cycling, running, etc.  I have never felt like they would fall out while sweaty and moving vigorously.
The in-ear Galaxy Buds are a better solution than my over-the-ear PowerBeats (especially when wearing glasses).  Both options are comfortable for hours, however the Galaxy Buds battery will die LONG before your ears have an opportunity to become uncomfortable.
Touch Interface:
The touch interface on each Galaxy Bud has been rock solid.  The buds easily discern between 1, 2, 3 and touch & hold commands.  At times my fingers were covered in something that I did not want the buds to be covered in (cooking, cleaning, etc.), I have used my wrist and even my forearm to pause the audio and the Galaxy Buds have accurately interpreted my wish Every time.
Bottom Line:
With some further development and software updates, Galaxy Buds could easily become an absolutely Amazing product.  Unfortunately, considering the higher cost of Galaxy Buds vs my PowerBeats 3 wireless buds - which easily have 3-4 times longer battery life (real life experience vs marketing claims) and far superior sound (bass) - the Galaxy Buds leave us feeling disappointed.  I would fully expect that Samsung will work out these issues prior to the next version of Galaxy Buds and will deliver a truly innovative product.
For now, I keep my PowerBeats 3 wireless buds charged and ready for action.
All the Best!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The pros:
- Decent sound quality; you can switch the codec to scalable in the dev options and it makes somewhat of a difference. as for sound and noise, people say that it is too quiet, don't believe them, they don't know how to work it. You have to change the touch options to when you hold down it will make the volume up, as the headphones have a separate volume than the phone does.
- Excellent noice cancelling; when you put them in your ears, you cant hear people talking around you, especially when music is playing. I have to take them out to talk to people because of how good it is. I've asked people around me if they can hear my blasting music and they say they can't hear a thing so that's good.

In the middle:
- The fit; they have adjustable earpieces in them and you can change them according to your ear size. after a while you start to feel the effect of the wing, but after getting used to wearing them for a day, they don't hurt like they did. I can now wear them for long periods of time without anything hurting. it's just a matter of getting used to it. they also have great bass isolation, just adding that in there.
- The look; I have a small head and I was really sceptical about getting these considering how big they actually are. I got them, and they don't look half bad. they look like they has a price on them when you wear them, like airpods do. They fit in my ears without me looking rediculise.

The cons:
- The only thing I have found to dislike about them is that you can feel that your wearing them. I had a pair of Bose soundsport and when you wear them, you couldnt feel them and it was like it was playing around you but then you'd look and no one was jamming to the music! 10/10 recommend those btw but keep in mind they hurt your ears lot after (it's worth the pain for the sound quality). Sorry went of on a tangent.. The buds let you know how heavy they are (not a lot,but more than others).

It's not ideal for dedicated music consumption. There are alternatives such as the soundpeats that offer much better audio quality, however with any other smaller brands they're limited in functionality or practicality.

Like the Airpods, these buds allow for single side use and gestures. Cheaper alternatives require some awkward fumbling to pause the music or worse pushing a button on the ear piece--this drives the ear piece into your ear and needless to say, it kind of hurts/uncomfortable.

Using this with Spotify premium (Android), I had to tweak the equalizer settings to get a comfortable listening experience without cracking the highs and the lows were kind of muted. Regardless, it's underwhelming coming from a wired experience.

Who would I recommend this to? If you like Airpods but you use an android device... Better yet if you own a Samsung device, without a doubt this provides the best listening experience. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, it sounds and works twice as good/well than on my Pixel 3 XL.

If you're conscious of spending or on a budget, the aftermarket alternatives will do you a solid that will be hard to beat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However I liked them so much that I purchased new after Amazon took care of me.

If you're looking for audiophile sound, look elsewhere. If you're looking for good quality sound, easy pairing, and comfort than I've found these to be a perfect choice. I wear them for about 2-3 hours at a time at work, never feel fatigued by them. I find they stay in with little effort and range is good, as I often walk away from my desk. My wife uses hers at work as well but only with 1 bud at a time. She agrees the quality is better than the airpods she has as well.

Like I said, if you're interested in audiophile quality sound, then you'll need to look at other choices. I've found that these seal well an keep most ambient noise out, although there is a setting that allows a touch to let more in. Touch controls weren't the best at first but updates have pretty much got them spot on. Only occasionally do I have it register a single tap instead of a double.

Somewhat durable, I've dropped mine once or twice with no issues.

Overall a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recently bought these wireless earphones and kinda clueless why a lot of people give these earphones a good review. First and foremost the design is great. I love how they don't stick out like Q tips on your ears, and the charging design cool. Here's the bad part.

As I used them when walking to school or work during phone calls it tends to lose a lot of connectivity with both pods in my ear. It sounds like the ear phones are losing signal. Second, when using one pod. Prior who I am calling tell me that they can't hear me at all. Not sure why it keeps doing that. It's legit updated about three times since u got them but these earphones are bad quality. Being Samsung brand and akg I think I get better results buy another pair of airpods.

Lastly forgot to mention that the earphones case smell like burn plastic or of the box.

But anyways:

Here is my rating:

Sound quality: 4/5: even though these sounds great and are pretty decent, it lacks bass, and if you set your EQ setting to bass, you'll notice you'll lose some clarity. So I'd recommend Dynamic.

Noise cancelling: 4/5: it's not like you can't hear anything, but they're great when someone is talking to you and you won't hear them. As for vehicles, yes, these are very decent in noise cancelling.

Battery life: Nothing bad to say at all actually.

Now the bad part:

Calling people: 1/5: these earbuds' inner microphone technology actually gets muffled by your ears. And because of this, the other people on the call will not hear you clearly at all. This was the very reason I gave these away to my little brother. I cannot handle the muffled sound complaints from my clients while on the phone... especially if its important.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Dont hesitate to buy em!","After leaving the iPhone fan group and switching to a new Samsung S10+, I was initially very skeptical as to the quality of these buds.

I should have never been worried! These are amazing! The case which holds the buds is very sleek and allows for wired or wireless charging. In addition, the buds have great battery life and the case provides even more juice on the go. What I truly like about these more than the typical apple airpods and other style buds is that they fit into your ear very nicely and they have an app that allows you to customize your sound settings for the type of music you normally listen to. They also have an ambient sound feature that allows you to hear people talking to you etc while you have them in your ears. It's a great feature!

If you're on the fence about getting these I would say just get them! They are worth the price and they definitely have comparable sound to Beats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What you need to do is turn OFF Dual Audio under Bluetooth in settings to stop the crackling Sound and reconnect.

If sound is too quiet, you need to turn on Media Volume sync under Bluetooth in settings. If you can't do that, or it's still quiet, set the buttons on the buds to adjust the volume and you can set it higher using the buds than the phone","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_236?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=236&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is very good for an ear bud. While it cannot match the bass and overall sound of a large over ear style headphone, these buds do a great job in a small package. As far as comfort, I have no complaints. They sit nicely in your ear and come with a few size options for the little wing tip that locks it in place. Even while sweating a lot at the gym and moving around a lot I have never had them fall out. The battery life is great, I haven't actually had them die on me yet because any time I'm not using them I put them back in their charging case and they get charged back up to full battery very quickly. I try to remember to charge the case for a little while every day and that has been enough to support using them for a few hours each day at work and also at the gym. The case is small and convenient to carry around, but a little slippery so I have accidentally dropped it or had it fall out of my pocket while grabbing my keys a couple times (and everything still works fine). The only reason I would not recommend these to someone would be if their primary use will be for calls. It seems like the other person has a little trouble hearing me when I talk, but I really don't make many calls with them so that is a not a priority for me. The ambient noise feature works decently if your music is at low volume. It is enough to hear your surroundings while walking indoors, but not great to have a full conversation and if you are outside, it picks up a lot of wind sound making it rather useless. Overall I would definitely recommend these ear buds to anyone with a Samsung phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here's the thing, if you're looking for an Airpod replacement for the Android world this will fit the bill.The cost is in line with the other big brands, the quality and functionality is all on par. As a professional in the financial industry I constantly find myself on conference calls and really wanted something to work as well as the Airpods for phone calls, these fail miserably. Let's break this down:

Pros - Rating 9/10
  * Connectivity 10/10
The Bluetooth connectivity on these buds is first class. Connected first time every time. Left bud solo, check. Right bud solo, check. Both buds, check. Back and forth quick switching, check. These were just amazing, faster and more reliable than my Airpods.
* Design 9/10
The storage case is sleek and compact, nearly identical in girth to the Airpods. They slide into my pocket and are virtually unnoticeable.
 * Comfort 9/10
The in ear fit is far away and above the fit of Airpods. Phenomenal fit and extremely comfortable. This was the number one reason why I held on to these for so long, haven't found a better fitting earbud yet.
 * Noise Cancellation (Passive) 8/10
The noise isolation (passive noise cancellation) was very very good with nearly zero outside noise pollution. This allowed for good quality audio when listening to music or videos.
 * Software 8/10
The accompanying app allows for altering the audio EQ, albeit limited selections, but better than what's on the market right now. The app also gives the user the option to change what your touches do left bud vs right bud.
 * Special Features 8/10
Ambient sound was a favorite feature, I found myself turning this on rather than removing my bud to speak to those around me (i.e. at the gym, quick interactions at the register, etc.) Very cool feature that prevents you from constantly pulling your bud out just to make a quick response.
 * Charging Features 10/10
USB C charging! So great to only need one cord to charge multiple devices now. and the charge time was fairly quick. These also support wireless charging and, should you have the newer Galaxy phone, you can charge them with your phone sans wireless. How cool is that! (keep reading, you might be doing this more than you think)

Cons - Rating 4.5/10
 * Call Audio 3/10
Call audio deserves the top spot on this list. The quality is atrocious! With the latest firmware update the background noise cancellation is so terrible that is garbles your voice so badly you will be constantly repeating yourself. Even in a quiet room the frequency range in the software is calibrated such that the high pitched noise pressure is cut out making you sound muffled and dense. Considering my unique need to be on phone calls for majority of my day, occasionally needing to speak to clients, these were a bust. At this price, you can do WAAAAY better if your just looking for workout buds or occasional music listening buds.
 * Sound EQ Quality 7/10
Bass response is weak on the buds. I wasn't expecting anything amazing but when calling out a specialized audio tuning (AKG) I expected more. Music sounded great no doubt, but I was left wanting. You do have a few fixed EQ settings, but you cannot modify the frequencies like a normal EQ. Still something is better than nothing.
 * Battery 6/10
Battery life was OK but not great. The sleek nature of the case apparently prevented Samsung from including a large battery in the case. I would get maybe 2 days until the case would be depleted after a few hours of use each day (mostly music as phone calls were just terrible and I was fearful to use them in case I had to speak). I feel this is a little on the lower end of battery life, but the case is very small.
 * Magnets 5/10
Weak magnets hold the buds in the case, I had multiple instances of the buds falling out in the beginning as I put too much faith in the strength of the magnets. The slightest jolt with the lid open will unseat the buds. I had one instance where the right bud wasn't seated correctly and didn't charge while in the case. That was odd.
 * Price 5/10
Price is a bit high for what is offered. This is my personal bias as I feel I lost 50% of the functional usage of these buds. When I resorted to using them strictly for music I felt frustrated every time I thought of the cost. The fit was perfect, the touch control and connectivity was tops, but music listening was not my top priority with these.

If you are itching to spend a cool Benjamin+, are an avid gym rat, love music and have a Galaxy phone, these are for you.

But they are more secure than airpods. I ended getting these after returning my airpods because I couldn't get the most out of the airpods from a Samsung device and I must say I'm happier. I'd recommend trying all of the wing tips and ear tips to find your fit before you decide that they aren't for you. My only concern is the battery case only gives you 7 more hours as opposed to the airpods 24 hours.. CMON MAN THATS RIDICULOUS. Touch controls work great actually, work better than the airpods touch controls and more options per bud too. Really these are better than airpods in every way other than the case's battery life. Cheaper too. Also note that the wing tips may cause some pain in your ear after an hour of wearing them or so, so keep that in mind. It doesn't bother me so much but this can be a deal breaker for most. So comfort is more of a 2 out of 5 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had them got A day and so far I'm pretty impressed honestly. I didn't have the gear iconx or whatever the predecessors to these were. I went for a decent length walk yesterday with Lots of stuff in my pockets along with my phone and had minimal sputtering, by that I mean once. The buds never came out of sync with one another fortunately as I had also read.
These buds are super immersive with their sound and I really like the quality of the sound, very full but the bass could be a little fuller, but its still pretty good, especially for wireless headphones.
The call quality for me was fine, not stellar, but when I got a call yesterday on my walk, I answered the call with my buds and left the phone in my pocket and kept walking and the call went smoothly. I was walking along a busy street and the person on the other end had no issues hearing me.
The down side wasn't on part of the buds, but amazon really. I didn't appreciate this, ""free one day shipping"" then my package didn't get to me causing me to have to go to the post office the next day and the told me that the package had just come in right before I got there. Amazon told me that my Apt wasn't accessable and told me that's why my package wasn't delivered. If it's really two day shipping, just say that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cons:
Biggest issue is the call quality. The main reason to have the bluetooth is to make calls while keeping my hands free to multitask BUT almost every call the other person says there is too much noise.  They cannot hear me clearly.

-Nice function for the case to be wireless charge-capable
-Earbuds are comfortable, have other size options if necessary
-Earbuds themselves turn on when in your ear, making them quite efficient for battery
-Easy connectivity with phone (using Samsung S9+)

Cons:
-Sound quality leaves much to be desired - using the equalizer in the Galaxy Wearable app is a must
-Lack of much customization for custom user commands with the long press
-Not waterproof (I bought another pair of wireless headphones for about $40 that were great and water resistant)
-Ambient Sound mode is a bit tough to really see the potential for at first (personal thing).

I like these headphones quite a bit. I've been a Samsung fella for some time, so I'm going to use these for longer and make an update later. These are mainly first impressions. However, if you're considering upgrading from another headset, I wouldn't really recommend it much unless you feel an actual need for the little quirks (ambient sound mode, touchpad instead of a button for functions).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Tuned by AKG, these Galaxy Buds are long-lasting and well balanced. I was able to get close to 6 hours of play time before recharging. The carrying case has the ability to quickly recharge the earphones and was very convenient to carry. Wireless charging is a big plus for this case as well.

To my delight, the sound was evenly balanced without too much bass or treble. Although, there is an app available if you do want to make sound adjustments.

The buds are pretty forgettable when inserted in your ear. Meaning that the weight is not an issue. Built-in gesture controls were super convenient in controlling my music without needing to reach for my phone. Thankfully, there are a myriad of included bud and positioning tip sizes for every ear type. I was able to mix-and-match my tips until I found one that was comfortable for me.

My favorite feature of this wireless earphone was the ambient sound mode, which allowed me to listen into what’s going on around me while listening to my music privately. Great for those open office situations or if you’re walking in public.

And when I get a phone call while I’m listening to music, the person on the other side could hear me loud and clear with the embedded microphones.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Buds blew away my expectations for wireless earphones and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bluetooth 5.0 gives it a snappy connection speed.

It fits more snuggly in my ear, it also comes with 3 different sized ear tips, and two different size wingtips.

The size of them will almost leave you in awe, the charging case is smaller and the buds are smaller.

The Touch controls still feel the same compared to the last one, albeit somewhat a bit more responsive - just a tiny bit.

Only cons are that it is NOT going to last long in water, I mean you can assume so from other reviews. It IS sweat resistant, of course.

Oh, and also it doesn't have on-board storage.

Other than that, it's an overall improvement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-Fit my tiny ears, comfortably
-Can be used together or independently
-Happy I've spent the money for the quality

I have gotten some cheap earbuds over the years, bought a different set and returned them the next day due to not fitting at all just before getting these. Granted the tech has improved as a function of time. These are worth every dollar so far.
I have small ears, finding buds that will fit is very hard (even using the smallest options). These are the most comfortable and secure I've ever tried.
Being able to use each bud independent of the other was a huge factor in deciding on these over the more expensive ones I was eyeing. I'm still getting used to the touch aspect, I like it though. You don't need to mash them into your ear to get the button to engage. The set-up was super easy and I like that there's an app for further control/customization.
It's a bit disappointing that the case dosn't have a bigger battery for more charges. That's a small gripe though since I tend to only use one at a time.
These aren't for hard audiophiles, from what I've seen so far. If that's a deal-breaker; go drop on some corded-over ear monitors.
So happy I took the plunge on these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had these earbuds for 2 days and returned them. The only thing I like about them is the battery life and the in-ear design.  Music quality sucks, phone conversations blow, and the hand gestures need work.  Okay, that is the summary.

Like you, I was in the market for wireless earbuds and I had narrowed it down to Samsung or the Airpods.  I am not a big fan of the Airpods ""boom mic"" design, so I read a few reviews of the Samsung earbuds, and they sound legit.  BOY were they wrong.  Lets start with sound quality, or better put, the lack there of.  I am not some music snob and can't quote any thing fancy about the sound.  I would just describe it as flat and weak. The bass does not exist. For any music (country, POP, R&B, ect)  The sound reminds you of the free handout earbuds you get on an airplane.  Yes, I know with an iphone you don't have assess to the  app with the eq, but the app I use to stream music has an eq in it and none of the adjustments made this sound any better.  I tried to convince myself it wasn't that bad, but it is.  I really wanted to like them. Next is phone calls.  In a quiet room, phone calls are fine. I meant TOTALLY quiet room. Any situation with background noise call quality is terrible.  I made several attempts in my car, walking the streets, in a doctor's office.  All had the same result.  People wee using context clues to piece together the conversation.  I really wanted to like these, but they suck!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_225?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=225&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd like to start off by saying the Samsung Galaxy Buds functionality review is #2 here and is separate from the main point.

#1: Nastiest package from Amazon ever. These buds came Very USED condition with oils and ear wax crusted to the device and charge container. Bought to use before going on a trip making it pointless to return at the time. Should have paid considerably less for having to sanitize them. Minor scratches on package after finding items were scattered, fully apart, thrown around in large shipping box.
Possibly the most disappointed I've been for conditions of a shipment in years. (4k picture uploaded, apologies for grossness)

#2: Samsung Galaxy Buds functionality: Still quite the upgrade from the first bluetooth set produced from Samsung. The size is perfect for small ears and has sizing to adjust for larger. Range is massive, best upgraded feature imo aside from size reduction.

Will update if new opinions.

I gave the buds a 5 star because the are perfect small portable and last a long time between charges I'm averaging around 12-13 hours total play back and that's insane for how small these things are. The are able to be charged either with a charging cable or wirelessly and both work well.. the size and weight of the actual earbud is perfect it's super light so once it in the ear its almost unnoticeable they do cancel most noise and do offer an ambient sound setting to help keep you alert to your surroundings but I have found that feature is not as good as I was expecting. The sound from these is good for an earbud but it's just not fair to compare these to a pair of high quality/studio headphones. The bass is impressive for the size but unfortunately the ear buds do not seem to get super loud even turned up the entire way they are loud but not deafening I am using these on my galaxy s10+ as well as my Acer Laptop with all eq settings to off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They run like don't have any connection issues.  The sound quality is excellent for the price.  You are not going to get ultra high end earbud sound quality out of them, but you are definitely going to get high quality sound.  I love the size of the case and how it slips into your pocket easy enough to forget about it being there.  My only gripe is the magnets that hold the earbuds in the case are a bit weak.  BE VERY CAREFUL with this when opening the case while walking on the street or other places.

Excellent comfort aside, the sound quality is pretty good, definitely on the level of Airpods and probably a step above.

Sound quality sucks. Great for phone calls, not so great for music.","These are good buds. But the gear iconx were great. I'm pretty torn between these and the iconx. IconX were a lot louder and better sound quality IMO. Also had better bass. But it was hard to use them for phone calls in the car or with TV on. Anybody I was on the phone with could hear every bit of environmental noise and claimed it drowned out my own voice sometimes because of the built in microphones being placed on the outside of the buds (not great if u drive an older land rover that has a lot of road noise). These new galaxy buds placed 1 set of the microphones on the inside of the buds and makes for better phone calls. Also, the gear iconx uses paper material mesh screens that block the noise if they get moist at all and then sound wont come through and u have to replace them. They come with 12 replacement screens, but there is absolutely NO wAY to order more! Samsung doesnt even carry them so I had to send mine back and then it took 2-3 months to replace them, but they didnt have any iconx any more so I decided to try the galaxy buds instead of the refund. I've only had them 1 day, and I dont like them as much as the icon x. Only thing I like better is the phone call quality is better and they use metal mesh screens that u can clean instead of those stupid paper mesh ones that get ruined everytime u work out with them. Bixby is even harder to work on galaxy buds. And they dont have the on board storage either which isn't too big of a deciding factor for me, but definitely was more convenient. However, I have my phone with me everywhere so the onboarding storage didnt matter too much. But they got rid of it and could have improved sound quality or something atleast.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Its loud enough that I can only hear my music when jogging, its great.

Speaking of jogging, these things have never once popped out during any strenuous activities/exercise either. Sometimes I'll be upside down for ab exercises and they've never fallen out.

I had tried the Bose wireless headphones before, way too big and clunky, fell out who knows how many times in the 1 week I had them before I returned them. AND the biggest thing that made me return them was because when on a phone call/discord/skype only ONE bud would work. These headphones work together or separately, they're 10/10.

The battery life is great too, I charge them for maybe 30 minutes every couple of days. But I'm not too sure on how long the battery life lasts in total, I generally use them at the gym for 2 hours a day, and a couple hours whenever I'm out of the house for shopping.

If you have android, it automatically connects to your phone the moment you close the case and pop them into your ears. Not too sure about iphone since I don't have one.

I need to get another pair for my mother, hook it up, Samsung!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sounds quality is important to me.  When I'm at home or on a plane, I use an older pair of Monster over ear noise cancelling headphones.  They're not Sennheisers, but they sound good and way better than any buds.
Functionally, the Galaxy Buds work great.  I've read about Bluetooth issues when they first came out, but those seem to have been fixed in an earlier update.  I've had no problems with connectivity or the app.  They stay nicely in my ears and I'm not worried about them falling out.  I love the low profile and the buttons work fine.
However, the sound quality is pretty much garbage.  Specifically, there is no low end.  There is a bass boost option in the app but it it doesn't boost bass at all.  I also turned on the eq in Spotify and turned the bass up there and that made it so that at least I can tell there is a bass guitar in the mix, but really no low end.  I even listened to Les Claypool. Also, when I've used these to make phone calls I've been told it sounds ok but not great.  One call that was made outside in light wind apparently sounded terrible.  I had to disconnect the pods and use the handset.
At first I was set on getting Airpods but I use Android, so when these came out I read some reviews and the marketing hype about how these were tuned by audio professionals so I took a chance.  My friend says his Airpods have decent bass and now I wish I got those.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Super Sound and Battery Life.","I ordered my Samsung Galaxy Earphones to be Surprisingly Satisfied. I feel Samsung has finally beat out the Apple Earpod. I find the case just the right size and still packs enough battery for several recharges. The ear phones themselves are excellent, great shape that locks into my ear and allows me to lie on a pillow without hurting my ear. I love that I can choose to where one st a time which only extends the battery life that much longer. Its nice that you can charge these wirelessly,  which I'm use to since my last 4 phones from Samsung have had that ability,  but when I upgrade to the Newest Note this Summer 2019 my phone will wirelessly recharge the earphone case if I'm somewhere without a plug.

I'll start off with the positives. The battery life is great, lasting the whole work day and well into the night on a single charge (with occasionally putting them in the case to charge during meetings). They're relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The case is decent quality and offers the option of wireless charging and USB-C charging.

Now on to the bad I've experienced. When walking with my phone in my pocket (S8), listening to Spotify, the music constantly cuts out, occasionally echos, and gets distorted. I thought it might have been a bad data connection so I tried playing some music that I had stored on my phone, but experienced the same results. I was hoping to use this when working out, going for a run, etc., but if I can't even walk down the street without connectivity issues, I can only imagine what vigorous work would do to it.

The case construction itself leaves much to be desired. It's made out of a cheap plastic and I could see the lid easily breaking off if my three year old gets ahold of it.

Bottom line: The Galaxy Buds are not for everyone. I would recommend them to those who are relatively staionary and don't have little kids. If you live any kind of active lifestyle, you should stay away until they update the issues they're currently having.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think these are nice headphones but I believe that it needs more work done to get me to ditch my old headphones. I bought these to workout and they work well in a closed off environment (gym/office). I do like the slick small case and how long the battery last.  I use these to run outside as well and it's here were they fail. If you run outside, not sure if it's the trees but the sound becomes too static. The music begins to skip by itself and sound comes and goes. Also, I loved the low profile design but I learned that it has a major flaw. Since these are kinda at the same level as your ear meaning that they don't protrude and if your hair covers it and begin to sweat, it eventually causes the touchpad to become completely useless unless you dry it off. If you are running it becomes really annoying to stop and clean them every so often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The #GalaxyBuds have about 13 total hours of battery life and I’ve pretty much been able to match or exceed those hours with basic use at work and at home while testing them out. And the best part is they charge SUPER fast. The Buds last about 6 solid hours on a single charge and then another 7-8 hours after a quick charge from the cradle/case, which charges them wirelessly!

The dual microphones and Ambient mode build in both earbuds has great voice quality during phone calls. I am pretty impressed. Ambient mode allows just the right amount of noise cancelling you can adjust to fit your surroundings. If you’re living or working in the big city you can adjust the sound.

If you’re a Samsung junkie you are familiar with the control features, like turning up the volume with a single touch or skipping to the next track with a tap. And if you’re new to Samsung’s lineup of premium sound headphones, you are in for a treat!

When I first received the Buds I was expecting them to be much bigger but to my surprise they are a perfect size and nice and lightweight. Samsung also included several different sizes of wingtips (or fins as I call them) and eartips sizes to find your exact fit for your ears to maximize comfort.

Pros

--Easy pairing/connecting to your devices.
--Battery life is pretty decent and the buds charge fast.
--Stylish, lightweight and comfortable.
--Premium sounds quality from AKG.
--Great for active wears. No falling out or shifting.
--Custom wingtips and eartips for comfort.
--Noise cancelling.

Cons

--Sound is slightly too low in ambient mode.
--In-ear sounds.
--Had to re-pair the buds after the left bud randomly stopped playing music.
--No way to clip case to keys or a chain.

These Galaxy Buds are top quality earbuds for those with an active lifestyle or just want to have comfortable buds to listen to music in the office. Call quality is a plus -- the calls are crystal clear and the dual microphones keeps a great balance of your voice for the caller. The battery life is great and the bud can charge to almost 2 hours in 15 minutes if you are in a rush. I think my favorite feature is the premium AKG sound quality for music and the built-in equalizer settings in the Samsung Wearables app. I am super happy to have these #GalaxyBuds in my arsenal for Samsung wearables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I live in the Apple-sphere, so of course I've been trying to use Airpods. Good sound, but they just don't stay in my ears. A few others had other problems. But, I came across a review for the Samsung Galaxy Earbuds from a trusted source, and decided I'd try once more. Well, they not only fit, but the sound quality is pretty good and they don't look like bended Qtips hanging off my ears (as a mature woman, that's important).

I have my hair parted to the side and that means I can use one of them at a time and listen to music at work without anyone noticing at all because my hair covers my right ear. The sound quality really is good. Definitely not like stock earphones at all. Not as great as a full on headset, but you hardly notice any dip in quality and you get amazing portability with it. I can't comment on the battery life just yet but I will likely update this with that info after a week, although I have a portable charger just in case. Also, it ships with a USB-C cable in the box so don't worry about purchasing that seperately. Very satisfied with my purchase.

EDIT: May 20th; The battery life actually isn't that bad. I haven't had to recharge them with my portable charger even once.

They're very comfortable, and you hardly feel them in your ears. They're a perfect fit, so they don't fall out. I was worried about losing them since there isn't a cord attached, but there is a convenient locator in the Galaxy buds app. There's also an ambient sound setting that allows you to hear what's around you since they are noise cancelling. Each bud has a touch pad that allows you to pause/skip song/previous song/etc. My only gripe is the touch pads are sensitive, so you can accidentally push it if you're not careful. It's not a negative though, as you get use to it. There's also a setting to lock the touchpad so you won't. I use these for sleeping and ASMR mostly, and I have to say they're the most comfortable I've tried so far. (I'm a side sleeper) I highly recommend them to anyone interested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had every Galaxy S phone since the S7, but this is the first pair of Samsung wireless buds I've ever owned. Previously, I'd just buy a $20 pair of bluetooth headphones on Amazon, which would last about a year before needing to be replaced. Those $20 headphones never had half the issues I've had in the past week with these!

My main issue with these buds is that everyday they disconnect and reconnect about 20x. Sometimes they'll say that they're connected and then I go to play music and they'll disconnect and reconnect, but still not play anything. I usually have to turn bluetooth off and on to get them to reconnect properly, and even that sometimes doesn't work, so I'll pull out the charging case, put them in, close the case, and re-open it. Eventually, they'll connect properly, but playing music shouldn't be a 10 step procedure. I have the stupid wearables app, and everything, the buds have a full charge, and they just don't want to connect properly. It's maddening, ding, ding, in your ear every time it decides to drop and reconnect because you tried to play a song.

My next issue is the call quality, I use these at work, where I take at least 10 calls a day. About 4 times now, I've heard myself echoing back at me, which is incredibly distracting when you're trying to have a conversation. It'll just start out of nowhere too, mid call. Other times, the mic is just really bad, people complain that they can't hear me and I have to speak up. It does nothing to cancel out background noise. I've been told to put myself on mute several times during conference calls with these buds (in the same office where my $20 buds had no issues).

Lastly, the wireless charging seems to be pretty spotty. It'll be charging and then all of a sudden lose connection, and need to be re-positioned on the charger.

At this point, I don't know if the issues I described are due to a defect, or issues with the Galaxy S 10 Plus, or what, but it's just unacceptable. A $1000 phone and a $120 pair of buds that can't seem to work right together just goes to show that Samsung doesn't know what they're doing. I'm sending back the buds, and looking into replacing the S10+ with a Google Pixel 3a XL.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They fit nicely into my ears and don't fall out at all. They are comfortable and don't have any weird protrusions that make them uncomfortable to wear. The buttons are easy to click. I would recommend getting a small plastic sandwich bag to put the case in for carrying it around in your pocket to prevent dust from getting into the charge port though. It's a simple and non-intrusive way to keep it clean. I had to dig dust and lint out of my phone charge port eventually because of this problem, so it does happen eventually.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are worth the buy! (Pro/Cons)","I am always VERY skeptical and do lots of research before ordering a new pair of headphones. I saw a lot of great reviews and a lot of bad reviews on these.

I was looking to get a pair of Samsung headphones to connect to my TV, since  Samsung SmartTV’s only allow you to connect Samsung Bluetooth headphones, no other brands. I have an iPhone (and a lot of other Apple devices), so I didn’t want to spend this much money on something that would ONLY work with my TV, but not my phone. Luckily, they work on any device and sound great!

*These are just my personal opinions, but I’m going to break down some pros and cons:

Pros
-They sounds great
-They work with any device
-They’re extremely comfortable in my ears, which is a first for me with any earbuds (AirPods are absolutely impossible for me to wear because they hurt so badly and fall right out)
-They come with several different options for the little tips that go on them to make them more comfortable in-ear
-They’re small, but not so small that I would lose them easily
-They stay in when I’m walking, running, etc.
-They will cancel out just about ANY sound around you
-There’s Touch Pads on each bud that allow you to pause, play, play next track, play previous track, and activate Siri/Bixby
-Battery life on the buds is actually pretty great, and the charging case will charge them completely a few times before needing charged itself

Cons
-Connecting to devices that are NOT Samsung devices can be tedious at times (especially if you want to connect to a specific device but have connected them to several already, or if you’re connecting them to a new device)
-The Ambient Aware Mode, Equalizer, and Auto-sync features are AMAZING, but ONLY available on Android-based devices!
-Same with being able to change what the touchpad does on each bud. Being able to change long-press on the touchpad from Siri to Volume Up/Down is also an exclusive to Android-based devices, which really bothers me because I’d LOVE to be able to turn the volume up/down from the buds!
(I tested these Samsung-exclusive features out on my mom’s Samsung S9+ and I have to say that these features are absolutely amazing and it’s VERY disappointing that they have them locked!)

As you can see, my pros list far outnumbers my cons. Although the cons are minimal, they are pretty big cons for me. The Ambient Aware Mode and other Samsung/Android-exclusive features are incredible. Really wish they’d allow other devices to use those features, but these earbuds are 100% worth the price tag to me, even without those features.

I guess it’s just a personal preference, but I never thought I’d find a pair of headphones/earbuds I liked more than my trusty old Bose SoundSport headphones. I was wrong. I can’t even wear my Bose ones anymore because I’m so used to how comfortable these are, the sound quality, and how great the noise-cancelling is!

Hopefully this helps a little bit if you research a lot too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In terms of design, they far exceeded my expectations.  At about $30 cheaper than AirPods, I actually prefer the design of the case and earbuds Samsung offers.  The soft rim and earpiece come in 3 sizes each, and I found that after swapping to the smallest, they fit snug but are comfortable for hours. I have run in them without any need to adjust them at all, a first for me with any headphone or earbud.  The touchpads on the earbuds are easy to use and one function is programmable.  The case is tiny... smaller than the AirPod case or any I have ever seen.  The bottom allows for wireless charging, a nice feature, but they do come with a high quality USB-C charger.  The earbuds rest in the case with magnets securely.

In terms of quality, the fit & finish is comparable to every Apple product I have ever purchased - high praise for sure.  The earbuds are very light, but sturdy.  They connect automatically after one seamless setup process (much easier than any other Bluetooth experience I've had) once you take them out of the case.

Regarding battery life, Samsung claims 6 hours, but I haven't had to push it nearly that far.  I have found after 3+ hours half-volume listening from full charge the earbuds are generally around 60%.  I firmly believe the battery life drawback is a sacrifice for the smaller case, which I'd rather lose personally.

All things considered, these are excellent ""truly wireless"" earbuds, I highly recommend them, especially if you have a Samsung phone.  If you travel often or want to put them in your pocket, these have the smallest case yet. Battery life is reasonable but not near first-class, and the overall design and build quality are excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a s9 plus which works seamlessly with the earbuds, but even with the latest update my phone and earbuds the connection was extremely poor. Whether my phone was in my pocket or on a table next to me they would cut out and change volume from ear to ear. Pretty sad because I'm a huge Samsung fan, but these were definitely a disappointment.

I talked to a Samsung representative guy and he basically said I must have had a defective product.... But I've read on some forums where a ton of people had the same problem.

I have a $30 pair of TaoTronics Bluetooth headphones that blow these out of the water connectivity wise.

I didn't expect them to be this small. I use another brand earbuds which seems too big before Galaxy buds. You know how the craving to use new buds will be. so I tried it extensively over last week. To my surprise, these became my favorites.Now to listen to music and for calls. I kept my other brand earbuds aside. It beats all other brands in size and audio quality. Connecting to Samsung devices was simple, and the calls are audible on both the buds, that's something new. These are small and yet fix perfectly in my ears. Buds never gave any issue connecting to multiple devices. And I tried connecting it to TV. It connected. That's so Cool, right ? Now I can binge watch all my shows without disturbing the house.
Pros:
 --Good for listening to music
--Small enough to fit completely in the ear
--Good charge time and battery life
--There is no ache or pain in the ear if we use it for a long time.
--Doesn't fall off while running or doing jumping jacks.

Con's:
--The buds case is small enough that it can be easily lost.
--Buds need to be properly placed in the case to charge even a small tilt will bring them out
--The case is not scratch resistant
--Not good for Audio calls when outside.

The other day while on was immersed in listening to music at home, My wife came up to and pulled my ear bud out. She was saying 'I have been talking to u and don't you hear me'. I was like I really couldn't hear her while I was listening to music. May be these act as noise cancellation in little.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I ordered them as soon as I could. But after having them for a week I am not as impressed as I hoped I would be. That being said I will be keeping them.

Pros
- Comfort,  these are extremely comfortable in my ears.
- Sound quality,  these buds sound great and have good bass. I love how they seal in my ears to block out other sounds when I really want to jam out
- Battery life/charging case,  they seem to live up to the 6 hour life and i like that i can put them back in the case to get some extra charge.
- Wearable app,  easy to navigate and like i can change some of the tap gestures.

Cons
- The ear buds occasionally have gone out of sync requiring me to remove one bud and putting it back  my ear so they are synced together.
- Ambiant sound mode automatically turns off when you remove one ear bud and you have to go back into the app to turn it back on. I have the long tap gesture set to volume so I can't turn it back on that way.
- I expected more out of ambiant sound mode. I bought these for going to the gym hoping that I could have a conversation with my wife and still listen to music. I can do this without having to remove a bud but do have to pause my music to hear her.
-  Blue tooth,  this issue I think is with my Galaxy S8 but cannot confirm. When I am outside I cannot put my phone in my pocket or swing my arms when walking as the connection drops in and out.

They block noise very well which is a pro for workouts and noisy offices but a con for situational awareness. Battery life is amazing.

The case is super slick, like fall out of your pocket slick.

Sound quality is.... Interesting.... If you jam the things in your ears, like uncomfortably so, then they sound good. If you try to let them hang out a bit so they are more comfortable and you can hear around you better, then the sound quality drops significantly. Bass is the most affected, but honestly the pros far outweigh the cons.

I have a lot of bluetooth headsets and these are the best on balance. However I'd like to stress that if you are going to wear them long term, like all day at work, then airpods are much better. After a few hours with these in they start to really hurt my ears.

I wish they'd have a smaller eartip than what's included like the old Moto Hint from back in the day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'll only leave a negative review if I feel that people should know about a serious issue with a product. Especially a product over $100.

These Galaxy Buds are cool except for a few things that I could just not accept. Having owned multiple Bluetooth headsets of different makes and models I have to say that this has been my least favorite. I've owned 2 different LG headsets, a Bose headset and these.

- These were uncomfortable in my ears, even after changing to the smaller size of the rubber fittings.

- The sound quality of music and podcasts by no means impressed me (not that it was bad, just wasn't great). The sound at max volume is quite low out of the box. This can be fixed though (after using Google to find the solution) by downloading the Galaxy Wearable app to increase the volume, which is a one and done resolution.

- MOST IMPORTANTLY, the phone call quality is horrible. I called several people while wearing these to find out that people could barely hear me at all. This could be because the microphones (which are on both buds) are all the way back by your ear. But it's 2019 so I wouldn't think this should be an issue. After searching on Google to find a solution I just came across pages and pages of Samsung's community forums of people searching for the same answers I was with no solutions.

These sleek and compact in-ear earbuds are great for music and phone calls in any situation. The convenient carrying and charging case ensures that the buds are charged and protected while not in use. A great feature of the case is that it can be wirelessly charged using a Samsung wireless charging pad. Charging is quite fast and the battery life lasts a long time. The option to connect via USB-C is available as well.

Connecting to a Samsung phone such as a Galaxy Note9 was very easy. The buds were detected and setup was completed in the Galaxy Wearable app and the buds are configured from within. Once the buds are paired, when the case is opened this automatically establishes a connection to the phone. The battery life indicator shows battery level for both the left and right buds as well as options for configuring the number of taps for various functions. The Equalizer has five modes (Bass boost, Soft, Dynamic, Clear, and Treble boost). There was some noticeable difference between these but nothing that was groundbreaking. A nice feature of the Galaxy Wear app is ""Find My Earbuds"". When initiated, each bud makes an audible noise that sounds like birds chirping but makes it relatively easy to find them if they're misplaced.

For the small form factor, these produce clear highs and some deep lows. The bass isn't deep enough to rattle any windows but it's good for the size. The active noise cancelling (ANC) does an OK job of blocking out background noise as long as the volume is turned up to about 60%. This was in an office setting where conversations at normal talking levels are occurring.

All in all, these are very well designed wireless earbuds which produce fantastic sound for all occasions. This fits well with the Samsung brand and is a home run in a small package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Without a galaxy phone I cant really justify purchasing these as theres simply too many features your losing out on.
Also, the earbuds are pretty quiet by default. You can change the touchpad on the earbuds to increase the EARBUD volume separately from the phone volume.

Say goodbye to the wire-tangled life.","First and foremost, I'm a dedicated runner, getting in between 8-10 miles each day, 5 days  a week, at 9 mph constantly- not including the distances traveled while walking at work or running errands. The remaining 2 days are for limited hit-cardio, but even then, I'll squeeze 3 miles at an uncomfortable pace of 10.5 for that burn. These buds STAY INSIDE YOUR EARS no matter how much you move around. That doesn't mean go crazy and start headbanging, but their very resistant to high intensity workouts. Just be conscious of them. Both are incredibly light and there are different ear tips for the buds should they not fit well. Different topic- but ..sometimes your phone/smartwatch, will register the run, other times it'll register it as just walking...either which way you're still getting a wire-free experience.

Ambient sound can be a tad irritating, and the touch controls MIGHT not respond accurately, but this is purely situational.
Their comfortable, fit securely, and are easy to use. controlling them through the Samsung gear app is also convenient.
It allows you to check the charge level of each ear bud, the connectivity status, control the notifications preference for what apps can be controlled via touch on the buds, touch-pad preference, etc.
So overall usage is wonderful, UX from feedback was definitely taken into account, and the UI with simple to remember taps to skip a song, a few songs, a whole track, answer and decline calls based on what bud is tapped, and more is incorporated into these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Battery life is fantastic and the little base provides extra charging. Fairly comfortable, stay in the ear ok, but they do start to feel heavy after an hour or so. But the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Not bad for rock/pop and working out at the gym, but classical and jazz sounds terrible. Very little bass even w/ the equalizer settings maximizing the bottom. I much prefer the sound quality of my Bose (wired) noice canceling in-ear phones.

As far as the product itself, well, they're pretty great for what they're meant to do, especially, when you consider the fact that the Sennheiser and many other rivals cost twice as much (or more) without any real benefits because these sound amazing, the noise isolation is superb, they're comfortable and light. The battery lasts a long time and they're easy to use.
The only real issue is the fact that the Bluetooth seems to cut in and out, a lot, I tried to change the settings but it doesn't seem to have any impact on the issue.

The headphones cut out while waking constantly, you can walk a good 100ft away from your phone and still use it so long as your skull isn't in the way, the noise cancelation works but the ambient voice option only works for about five feet so it's useless, the sound is fine, sometimes it says it's playing music but there's no sound, sometimes I have to pair both headphones, sometimes it refuses to play more than a few minutes unless my s10 remains unlocked, the sound it makes when it dies is exactly the same as the sound it makes when it shuts off for an update so that's confusing, they are slender so that's cool, my ears don't like these at much as my old 35$ pair, there's no flashing light so they are sneaky, they're shiny so not too sneaky, the touch pad is both too sensitive and also not sensitive enough (ie it's too easy to double click but also a single stand of hair can block your finger), the battery life isn't bad but it's not great either, wireless charging from my phone is pretty rad in a pinch, Bixby doesn't make a distinct enough sound when activated, honestly I had less complaints about my 35$ wireless headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far I have really enjoyed using these even over nicer Sony headphones.
Pros
The sound quality on these earbuds is pretty decent considering the fact that they are completely wireless.
The Samsung Wearables app has a simple and user friendly design with an equalizer for customized audio.
The connection strength is surprisingly good, I can leave my phone at the desk and walk around the house without connection issues.
The tips make a decent seal which provides ample noise isolation.
The included tips and wings fit extremely well for me and never fall out.
The battery life for these last around 8-10 hours for me (I usually play music relatively quietly)
Cons
I couldn't think of any
All in all, 5/5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_226?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=226&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And to be fair, these still sound great! But pale in comparison to the AKG's that come packaged with Samsung phones, particularly in the lower freqs.

That being said, the battery life is not bad; I can go all day using them on and off without needing to charge, the interchangable rubber pieces insure a perfect fit, and the connectivity features with the touch sensors are quite useful.

Final note; these earbuds are high quality for a fair price, but if you're an audiophile, you may be a little disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_226?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=226&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Light, comfortable.  The AKG speaker with the combination of the seal creates a wonderful sound surrounding.  They become even better within the Samsung's eco system.  The touch controls and Samsungs app brings convenience to another level.

In comparison, Jebra lacks the convenience and comfort (Too Big), Airpod lacks the sealed sound.  But I will be returning these and keeping the Airpods due to the fact that call quality is still lacking.  People whom I called complain on the clarity in comparison to the Airpods and Jebra.  This is due to the fact that they have a mic stick closer to the mouth.  Its not Samsung's fault. Its just physics.  With the small form factor comes the price.  The mic is still clear enough in a not too noisy coffee shop. But if you are on the street and or on a windy day, the receiving end of the call will have problems hearing what you say.
Bottom Line :  Comfortable great sounding headphones.  and if listening to music is your priority, I'd get them.

The sound quality actually was a pleasant surprise. I really wasn't expecting much from it sound quality wise, the actually sounded pretty good. I find that higher volumes is where seem to get the punchiness of the bass. Mids and top ends r clear (not the crispiest but crispy).

The battery life isn't the best but with wireless charge it's so simple to just plop them down and pick them up when you're ready to go that you will rarely ever be in danger of having them die.

Connection: Unlike some other people, I haven't had problems with sound cutting out while the phone is in my pocket. I've even walked into another room and the earbuds work just fine.
Sound Quality: Good not great. If you've already got some fantastic in ear headphones then these will only serve as a convenience, not a replacement.
Ambient Feature: This is another feature that I liked for the convenience factor but the quality isn't that great. If you want to hear something while you have them in, you can activate this feature but it sounds like it's coming through a tin can.
Battery Life: I haven't used a full charge on these things yet. I checked their percentage periodically while in use and they seem to last a long time. I could probably get through a full work day with some breaks in between.
Comfort: You have to rotate the earbuds so that the fin is pointed up. I feel like the left one isnt as snug as the right but I've had that issue with earbuds before. Maybe my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right. Overall they are very comfy and light.

I do want to complain about one thing though. The charging cable that comes with the case is plastic and maybe 3.5ft long. I think with the price you're paying they should at least offer a higher quality cable. I guess if they wanted to offer a competitive price to Air Pods they had to cut costs somewhere, right?","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These buds survived 5+min swim in the deep end of my pool!","I'm a HUGE fan of Samsung in general. I discovered them over a decade ago and I've been with Samsung ever since. Some may say that fact alone renders my review to be biased. But they'd be wrong. Very wrong. I'm possibly more skeptical than anyone you know.
I've heard all kinds of claims about these buds barely being sweat resistant. Well, I've been using mine DAILY, sweating like crazy down in Houston Texas as well, and I'm amazed by the resilience of these crazy comfortable and light as a feather - great sounding {wireless} earbuds!!!!
Both the charging case and the buds fell into the deep end of my pool today by accident. Normally I would have dove right in to retrieve my precious tech. But all of those (false) claims of their water resistance told me to write them off and buy another pair.
It took me roughly 5 mins to grab the skimmer and scoop them out.
No one believes this next part, but I don't leave extremely positive reviews for the adrenaline rush! Lol.. I kid you NOT- whenever I grabbed the charging case out of the skimmer net (with the buds still inside mind you) THEY WERE STILL CHARGING!
THE INSIDE WAS A LITTLE WET, BUT IT MADE ZERO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER! IT'S BEEN ABOUT 3 HRS SINCE THE INCIDENT AND I'M STILL JAMMING MY FAVORITE PLAYLIST!
I'm completely amazed by the sound quality, battery life, connectivity, durability, style, options, etc.. of these very reasonably priced buds!
These earbuds have even saved me unknown amounts of money in terms of phone cases and screen protectors and deductibles for refurbishing or replacing broken screens, cases, protectors, etc.. seemingly everytime I would set my phone down after changing a song or whatever it may be because of the corded earbuds yanking my phone off the table and onto the floor.
In short, the true wireless feature alone, at least for me, is more than worth it because these have truly has paid for themselves a few times over by this point.

That being said... one would think, that with all the new advancements in protective coatings of late, that Samsung would have made the outside layer of the charging case FAR MORE scratch resistant than they are. After maybe 3 days of very limited and controlled careful use, I could barely make out the lettering on the top and bottom of the case.
In retrospect, my small complaint is just my skepticism finding anything possible to critique.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TRULY WIRELESS EARBUDS TO ALL SAMSUNG GALAXY FANS ESPECIALLY. BUT ALSO TO ANYONE WHO WOULD RATHER SPEND LESS $ ON QUALITY EARBUDS.

Oh, and 1 more thang... this ain't no fake review.
Buy you some ninja.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had the Jabra 65ts, the jaybird Vistas, beats x and the B & O E8's. I was on the hunt for the best wireless earbuds to use while I'm working in the office so I would buy a pair, use it for a couple of days, and then swap them out with a different pair to see what I liked the best. I listen to music or play movies in the background while I'm working. I want good sound quality, doesnt have to be audiophile sound but it needs to be clear and immersive. I tried the B&Os but the bluetooth connection was horrible. I frequently lost signal in 1 or both earbuds. The sound was good but it wasn't so good that I was willing to put up with dropped signals for the price I paid. Then I tried the Jaybird Vistas. The sound quality was awesome, I think they sounded better than the B&Os because the bass was deeper and more authentic feeling. That's the best way I know how to describe it. The problem I had with the Jaybirds was that there was no ambient sound pass through and they caused ear fatigue after an hour of use. From there I tried the Jabras. They sound almost the same as the Jaybirds except for the bass, which had less impact than the Jaybirds but was still very good. The Jabras also have ambient noise passthrough which is a feature I really like to have because I can use both earbuds in the office and still hear what's going on around me. What I didn't like about them is that they are a little big and to me they seemed goofy in my ears. The fit was secure and they felt comfortable but I just could not get past the part where I looked like a robot when I was wearing them. They were too distracting for the office. My last option was the galaxy buds and if they didnt work out, I was going to go back to my Beats x which sound good but they have that cord that ties them together and it's always getting in the way and pulling the buds out of my ears. The galaxy buds have all the specs I'm looking for, ambient sound pass through, customizable sound through the galaxy wearable app, discrete profile, comfort and most importantly, they sound great. I saved these for last because I thought I would have a better chance with the more expensive brands. However, I learned that a higher price tag does not always mean better performance. In my experience the Galaxy buds sound almost identical to the Jabra 65t's. They have a really clean and crisp sound, the bass is not as punchy as the Jaybirds but they have a nice impact to them which is perfectly fine for my office use.  Also, the ambient noise pass through seems to work a little better on the galaxy buds than the Jabras. For the price you pay, I was surprised at how great these buds performed in every task especially compared to the more expensive competition. The charging case has been working flawlessly and the wireless charging is a great feature that I personally use a lot. I haven't had any issue with the connection dropping out and I frequently walk away from my phone while I'm listening to music or movies. The galaxy buds are awesome and the price is very reasonable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This can be done by changing the hold touch action through the ""Galaxy Wearable"" application. You will no longer need to do this after doing it once.

These are a MASSIVE improvement over Samsung's previous line up of true wireless earbuds (Gear IconX). I have not yet run into a single issue relating to software like I did in the older models. Software updates are much easier to do now, and only take roughly 5 minutes.

Sound:
(Don't mess with EQ too much)
The sound quality is nice, but its obviously not a mind shattering audiophile experience. They sound best (to me) while using the phones flat equalizer with the ""dynamic"" equalizer in the ""Galaxy Wearable"" application. The bass response on the very low end is pretty impressive, but the volume of the bass is not going to get you the thud that normal wired earbuds do even if you attempt to crank the bass in EQ. The highs are surprisingly crisp and clear, but sometimes harsh when the volume is too high. The mids are perfect I have no complaints there.

Fit:
The ear buds are smaller than previous models, and don't stick out as much; however these may be uncomfortable to lay down with on your side depending on the size of your ears, but still a big improvement over the IconX. The ear tip is redesigned and allows for a fairly fiddle free fit in your ear. They press in very easily and can be twisted slightly back for a snug fit. The standard size tips, and wings fit my ears perfectly, and I never have to adjust them after initially putting them in. The ear tip sizing seems to be more dramatic on the small and large tips compared to previous models, but that's not a bad thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's important though to manage your expectations and to know what these earbuds are best suited for. It seems that these are meant to be Samsung's answer to Apple's Airpods, so they're mostly for casual listening while you're on the move with an emphasis on convenience. If you're expecting anything more out of these than what they were designed for, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed.

** Build Quality: The buds are made of plastic, but they seem sturdy enough. The case feels sturdy with a good heft to it to make it feel premium. The case is small enough to slip into a pocket without any problems, and the magnets in the case are strong enough to keep the buds in the case so you don't accidentally drop them.

** Comfort: I think one of the places these truly stand out is comfort. I've tried the Jabra 65t Elite earbuds, but they were a little too big for my ears and caused pain after about 30 mins of wearing them. The Galaxy Buds are considerably smaller and lighter. (See pictures to get an idea of size.) They create a great seal for sound isolation to keep your music in and your surroundings out. They fit securely and don't fall out of your ears easily like some other bigger earbuds, and I felt confident that they wouldn't fall out even when I went for a run with them. (Obviously, you might need to play around with the included ear tips and fits to ensure a good fit/seal.)

** Connectivity: I haven't had these for too long, but in my experience so far, the connection seems to be solid enough. The initial pairing process is especially easy if you have a Samsung phone. I have an S8+, and all I had to do was open the case and a notification popped up on my phone to pair and set everything up. Would've appreciated the ability to pair to multiple devices simultaneously, but that is sadly not present. (You can long press on touch buttons on both earbuds to enter pairing mode to switch between devices.) I'll update this review if I have problems with the connection in the future.

** Audio Quality: To be perfectly honest, my expectations for audio quality were pretty low, but these buds blew them out of the water. I'm not one of those audiophiles who has to have the higheset quality audio kit, but I do know how to appreciate good audio. At $130 and with a tiny physical footprint, the Galaxy Buds aren't meant to pump out mind-blowing audio quality, and if that's what you're looking for, you'll have have to look elsewhere (and there aren't any truly wireless earbuds that can stand up to high quality wired earbuds let alone proper over-ear headphones). I would say that these are on par with or maybe better than the Jabra 65t Elite earbuds in terms of audio quality. Out of the box, the quality is just alright, but once you turn on the Dynamic Mode in the EQ in the app, sounds phenomenal. Highs are clear, bass is ample and full, mids are smooth.

** Battery Life: Specs say 6 hrs with 7 more hrs in the case. Most sources say that this is accurate, but I haven't had these long enough to say for sure. If I find otherwise, I'll update this review.

** Cons: Not a whole lot. The one minor thing I've noticed so far is that the touch controls are finicky and it's difficult to adjust the volume directly from the earbuds. You can set it so that a long hold press on the left bud will do volume down, and a long hold press on the right bud will do volume up, but that's really not a very convenient way of doing all that.

Overall, I am incredibly happy with these earbuds. Sound quality exceeded my expectations, and they're super convenient. The only way you'd be really disappointed with these earbuds is if your expectations are unrealistically high.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sleek and small design makes them perfect for public use, and they cancel noise very well.

It's not the best, but it certainly didn't leave me disappointed. The battery life also never got in my way. The case always kept my earbuds charged and ready to go.

Great battery life, and multi-feature button is great.","I wanted headphones that I could wear to the gym and not need a wire attached to my phone or even around the back of my neck. A friend had these and I knew I had to try them.

They do not fall out. I can run, jump, accidentally hit myself in the head with a rake, they don't go anywhere. The battery lasts and lasts and they charge very quickly when it finally runs out. And the case is convenient to carry around without needing a ton of space.

As much as I enjoy trying to blow out my ear drums and ruin my hearing, these just don't quite do it but are plenty loud enough. The sound quality is quite good, but you won't get a whole lot of bass simply due to how small these things are.

The only word of caution I would give is for people with in-ear piercings. I have a daith, which sometimes gets a little uncomfortable with the earbud after several hours of wear, and that earbud will often discharge a little faster because it occasionally contacts the metal of my earring. But it's hardly enough to annoy me, they're great earbuds.

Sometimes people don't notice I'm wearing them, which can be fun when they start talking and it seems I'm ignoring them, but hey, the noise cancelling works really well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Playback flags between left and right bud when the phone is in your pocket and youre walking. Zero noise cancellation, especially outside or on the train. In public places, you have to turn volume of audiobook up to max to hear properly. Poor voice quality during calls, especially outside, got to disconnect and use handset 50% of the time.

I will say that sometimes there is issue with the connection quality if the phone is in your pocket, but given how darn awesome these things are, that's not an issue for me.  Sound quality is good all things considered, but I'm no audiophile so I would understand if some people might be disappointed.

(I paired it with MacBook Air and iPhone X.)

I own numerous BT audio gears from many different makers (Bose, Apple, Beats, Sennheiser, Logitech, etc.), so I know that some latency is to be expected on BT audio and connection can be choppy at busy environment. That said, Galaxy Buds' connection is just bad. Video is out of sync and you can notice it without really trying, and for some reason the audio pops and plays at mono for about 0.5 second for every 30 seconds or so. (Possibly a bandwidth problem?)

I also find it inconvenient that it does not have any physical buttons for BT pairing mode. The only way to engage the pairing mode is to open the case, and sometimes it just doesn't work. A button that could force the mode would've been great.

I like the sound quality and how they stay in my ears (unlike AirPods), but the connection problem ruins the whole experience. It is possible that I could've gotten a faulty unit, so I requested a refund for this item.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Upgrade worthy? Debatable.","I've been HYPED about these earbuds since they were announced during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked Event, and now I have them! I also own the predecessor to these, the Gear Icon X 2018s. I also have a pair of Jabra Elite 65Ts as well, I threw in some photos of those for a size comparison. I like these earbuds. Sound is good, definitely marginally better than the previous generation. The Galaxy Buds look better, they feel better, they're smaller, and the case charges wirelessly which is actually SUPER useful.

Now, I'm a Samsung FanBoy through-and-through, that being said, I think Samsung took a couple of steps backwards on a few things comparatively. The gestures are essentially the same as the previous gen except they got rid of swiping up and down on the earbuds for volume control. It's not the biggest deal since you can still set up the earbuds to give you volume control (based on long presses of each earbud) but now you have to choose between being able to control the volume from the earbuds or triggering ambient sound or voice commands, you cannot do both (from the earbuds at least), and that's kinda lame. Additionally, it seems like they've weakened the capability of Ambient Sound? On the previous gen I REALLY felt like I could hear my surroundings, within at least a ~10-15ft radius when Ambient Sound was active. With the Galaxy Buds that listening-radius feels significantly abbreviated for some reason? Additionally, most likely in the interest of shrinking the form factor, the Galaxy Buds no longer have their own onboard storage, so you can not store music on the buds themselves. That feature was super useful when you wanted to go for a run or workout but didn't necessarily want to have to bring your phone, fortunately not having it isn't a deal-breaker by any means.

I feel like these decisions might have been driven by the desire for more people to download Samsung's Galaxy Wear app, which is fine as a companion app. I feel as though with the Gear Icon X 2018s the goal was to help you not have to rely on your phone very much, if at all, where as the Galaxy Buds definitely make your phone a bit more necessary.

In summation, they're awesome wireless earbuds! They sound great, they look great, they're compact, wirelessly chargeable, LOUD, comfortable, and not uber expensive! Personally, I love features and options. Even if I'm not particularly going to use something often, I still prefer to have the option just in case and I would say objectively speaking, compared to the Gear Icon X 2018s, your options are definitely a bit lessened with these guys.

Upgrade worthy? Ehhhh, if you're like me and prefer options and the Gear Icon X 2018s fit you comfortably then I would say you're not missing out on anything more than a slightly modified design. If that's worth an upgrade to you, go for it! If not, I think your Gear Icon X 2018s are worth hanging onto for a while longer! Lastly, if you're new to the wireless earbud game, for $130 these are definitely a solid contender, especially considering the competition. Would recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

After a month the left ear bud crapped out, the case opens and the ear buds going flying if you drop them. Honestly just purchase air pods and some little rubber ear buds to fit ur ear better if that’s the case.

The number one reason for the low review is the absolute travesty of a microphone they put in these. Tinny with way too much treble going through. They pick up everything around you and sharply magnify the sounds.

I got two of these by accident. I had one ordered through Walmart, but they said they were out of stock. Amazon did not have them at the time. I canceled my order with Walmart and got them through my carrier, but Walmart suddenly got a pair back in stock and shipped them anyway.

So I kept them and gave them to my girlfriend. Now, we like to use these when talking to each other, but her voice is so sharp it's painful. One of us always has to remove  them to talk, because it really hurts the ears. I have a squeaky door at work and whenever someone goes through, she gets a blast of sharp sound, and I'm in the other room from the door!

These are very disappointing for the price. My $40 Firacore pair had way better sound quality, microphone, and battery life. If you want a pair of buds to talk on the phone with, I'd look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

* These sound great. I tend to keep them on dynamic mode. Paired w/ a samsung galaxy s10 + they sound fantastic. Base is just fine, and everything sounds well balanced. I even noticed sounds in a movie that I hadn't before. I've connected them to my laptop, soundbar, phone and desktop. Everything worked great. #thumbsup
* Connectivity has been good. I've had a little bluetooth interruption once that I can remember. Hasn't been a consistent issue at all. I'd say 95% up time, so to speak. I have connected the buds to my samsung phone, my macbook, iMac, and my Sony HTst5000 soundbar without any issues. I haven't noticed losing connection due to distance ever.
* Super light and comfortable. I've had to play with the different ear rubber sizes. I'm starting to think each of my ears are a little differently sized. I've found if I put them in, and then back them out some it seals out the sound nicely. (Maybe I was putting them in too deep?)
* The app is great. A lot of folks have complained about ambient mode. It's worked pretty well for me.
* Battery life. I used them off and on for 4 days before I realized I needed to charge the case. Pretty good :)
* Touch controls. Any new touch control will take a minute to get used to, but I haven't had any issues at all. I just had to get used to it. I love that you can customize the touches to interact with your playlists, calls, and other things.
* The case is small, compact, and light. Its a little slippery in the hand, and you have to be intentional when you open it, but you get used to that. When you open the case, it connects to your phone before you can put buds in your ears. There's even a soft sound to indicate when the phone knows you have a bud in each ear. Nice touch.
* Wireless charging is responsive and quick. The case charges the buds pretty quickly, too.

All in all, these are supurb. I really like them, and glad that I got them. Pick 'em up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wanted to love these buds but they suck and I don't love them at all. I returned a pair of soundcore neo's that sounded twice as good at half the price but had some connectivity issues when my galaxy s9 plus was in my pocket and I was walking or running. So I bought these Samsung Buds figuring they'd be much better, especially at more than double the price. I'm not sure whether connectivity is better because I couldn't get past the horrible tinny sound and lack of volume. I went into the Samsung Wearable app and set the volume at Max, maxed volume on my phone as well, but they're just garbage. Low volume AND horrible sound quality. And it's not just this particular set, either. I paired a set my friend has and same thing. So save your money and buy the soundcore neo's, maybe you won't have the same issues I had. Or, spend a little more and buy the Sony's like I'll be doing right now.  UPDATE. I decided give these buds buds more of a chance. I have an xl ear chamber so replaced the largest sized tips(included with buds) with a larger pair that I had from another set that still allow the buds to fit in the case and accept a charge. Doing that improved the performance of these buds dramatically. As far as volume goes I've gotten used to the max volume of these buds and find it to be quite sufficient since I now get a better seal from the larger tips. I've changed my two star rating to four, and would give them a five if Samsung included some xl size tips for those of us with larger ear canals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I'll give this review as unbiased as I can. Also, I'll include a summary at the end if you dont want to read my long review. Also, also, I'll be comparing them to airpods in many ways as they were made as a direct competitor.

So I'm going to break this down into materials and design, connectivity, sound, fit, and features.

Design and Materials:
Starting with design, this is subjective of course, but I personally really like how the buds look. Comparing them to the airpods, I think that the more subtle design paired with more colors is really appealing and will draw in more people. That said, airpods have become sort of a meme and their design has become very mainstream. The case is also well designed. It looks better than the airpod floss case, in my opinion, but it isn't as satisfying as the airpod case. That said it is easy to open and looks clean, especially the matte black. Now onto the build quality. The earbuds themselves are very light, but this is okay as you want to basically forget they are in your ear. That said, the buds dont feel cheap. The materials are very nice and they feel good in hand, and head. The case is a similar story. Light but substantial enough that it feels well made. Like I said, I also love the matte finish on the case.

Connectivity:
So much like the airpods, all you have to do, on Samsung Phones, is open the case and after a moment the buds pop up and boom, your connected. This remains the same after you first connect, just open the case and by the time their in your ears, you're connected. The range is okay. If you go more than about 15 feet, give or take, they start to break out. But if you have your phone on you, you're good. I also havent really had any stuttering or anything like that, just clear audio if you're in range.

Sound:
So this is possibly the most important category. Now I dont pretend to be an audiophile but I have listened and own a fair number of headphones. So with a package this small, I kept my expectations low. But when I got the buds, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the sound. Songs like Hotel California are really well balanced. Vocals are really clear and highs are also clear and clean. However, where the buds lack heavily is in bass. Rockstar sounds alright but if you need crazy bass, fully wireless earbuds are not for you. I mean, the driver is really small so you cant really expect earth shattering bass. But I know kany people love their bass, as i do too, and you may miss it with these. However, that isn't what these are for. The galaxy buds are made to be convenient, small earbuds, and as a result, audio suffers. That said, I think the audio will be very good for most people, as long as you can live without some bass. Again vocals are great and highs are clear and crisp.

Fit:
So possibly the best feature that the buds have that the airpods dont is the fit. This is because you get three different wing tips and ear tips in the box. This means that most people will be able to find a combination that fits them well and comfortably. Contrast that with the airpods which dont come with anything and the either fit or they dont. Another important difference between these and airpods in the in ear design. This means you get very good sound isolation which you will either like or not like. However, Samsung has included an ambient sound feature which works pretty well. The fit overall is superb, though. Once you get the right ear tips, you honestly forget that they are in your ear. They are also very good for working out because of how small they are and how well they fit, I mean, they wont come out of your ear, they go in your ear very well. Again, this is a mixes bag with airpods as if they dont fit you, they can easily fall out.

Features:
Wrapping up this review is features, and there are quite a few. So starting with controls, you have a touch capacitive panel on each earbud. The controls work well but I'm not a huge fan of the implementation. A single press only play pauses, a double press only skips, etc. The only customization you have is with the long hold. You can either have that trigger a voice assistant, volume or toggle ambient noise. I wish you could go deeper into controls and, for example, have play pause on the right with a single press, skip on the left with a single press, volume up and down by holding down on left and right, and ambient noise as a double tap. And who knows, software may change and make this possible. Another thing I dont really like is that, unlike the airpods, you cant take one bud out to pause the music and put it back in to resume it. Again, this could change with software. Speaking of software, the galaxy wearables app has a decent amount of customization, better than apple at least, and I hope to see Samsung continue to improve it. One thing that you can use with the app is the ambient noise toggle. I actually really like this feature and it works pretty well. The microphones do a pretty good job of amplifying voices and it works at a good distance too. The fact that they can charge wirelessly is also a big plus, especially for Galaxy S10 users with the reverse wireless charging. Other small features are USB-C, decent battery life, good quick charging (1.5 hours from 15 minutes of charging) and the overall convenience and size of the package.

So overall, the Galaxy Buds are made very well and look quite nice too. The pairing process is very solid, especially on Samsung and the range is good for mose people. The sound quality is pretty standard for this price range and lacks on bass but has clear mids and vocals as well as crisp clean highs. The customizability of the fit is amazing and means that the buds will fit most people. Finally, the buds' controls could be better but they have plenty of other great features like wireless charging. Overall, a very solid package and for $130, what are you waiting for?","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In short, the sound quality is absolute garbage. I really can't believe how quiet these are. I am no audiophile, but I definitely like my music loud. I especially listen to music loud when I am lifting weights (which is what I purchased these for), BUT these are so darn quiet I can't believe anyone who appreciates music would be able to use these. For running they were ok since I don't turn up the music too loud for long durations.
The sound level probably gets to the point where medium would be on any other pair of average headphones- maybe a tad higher. It was REALLY ANNOYING. The actually audio quality was OK at best as well. Adjusting the equalizer resulted in very little difference in the muddled audio profile. DO NOT BUY. The build quality, comfort, ease of use all were good, but what's the point if the audio stinks??

Follow up review:
After several weeks, I realized that this earbuds have a major issue: when you make phone calls with earbuds, it’s kind of like you are in speaker mode on a phone. It’s fine by you if you are using the earbuds, but not so much for the other person who is on the other line. Because it’s like on speaker mode, the other person hear really well the environment noise, especially if you are in a noisy environment, it literally picks up all the noise, such as other people talking. Even if you are doing dishes and using the earbuds to talk at the same time, that dish washing noise get transfer very well through the earbuds, so that the other people could find a hard time to hear you clearly, or sometimes it’s very annoying to hear some sharp noise when you accidentally knock your dish to each other. It feels like you never know when it’s going to “shock” you with these sharp noise if you are on the other line.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm going to be honest, the bass isn't what you'd imagine, it's more of a clean and solid punch. The audio is very clear, haven't tried calling anyone with them yet, but I've heard nothing but good things about it. Bixby is available. I recommend using them with Dolby Atmos turned on, it improves the quality and volume even more. Keep the setting on dynamic mode. The sound isn't overwhelming like some, they fit comfortably and will not fall out of your ears. The touch gestures were hard to get used to at first for me because I couldn't touch them directly, but once you learn where they're at it gets easier. Overall, I love these, they are extremely cool, have great sound quality, and allow you to be more hands free. Very reasonable pricing, and in my opinion, they are definitely worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything was better than I thought it would be. They don't leak sound. They innately cancel noise thanks to the in ear design(I was buying larger Headphones with a ANC switch so this was important for me). I also learned that they are.. err.. water proof(I bet you can guess where they ended up for me to learn this lol). The battery life is excellent as well. You basically store them in the charging base. The sound itself is impressive. I was really impressed with the solid amount of base these put out.

I decided to purchase these for my wife after trying out the Jabra Elite 65t earbuds.

I originally purchased the Jabras for her since she liked my AirPods but since she doesn’t have an apple product she needed an alternative. The Jabras sounded only okay. I was surprised to find their sound was only mediocre.

The real problem though was the fact that the Jabras, no matter what ear bud size she tried, hurt her ears. That was a no go since she wanted to listen to her music in bed.

We tried out the Galaxy Buds and while the sound quality is still about a 4/5, they fit my wife’s ears and that’s what we needed.

I tried them out as well and they are actually very comfortable and provide a great deal of noise cancellation right out of the box. I tried out the EQ settings on her app as well and I prefer the higher bass setting, so after tweaking it to my liking I was impressed for sure.

For me, as an iPhone user, I thought the simplicity of AirPods would surpass other brands but I could certainly get by happily with Galaxy Buds, and the latter are about $40 cheaper.

If you buy these I doubt you’ll be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm sure you know the features by now, so i won't bore you with them.

how does this compare with airpods? absolutely no contest! never had an issue with call quality. how many times do we answer the calls anyway? if you are having weird issues, echos etc, could be due to older firmware with ambient sound turned on. had mine updated to new firmware on first day of purchase.

considered getting sennheiser momentum true wireless and b&o beoplay e8 2.0 before but realised they were bluetooth 4.2 or with master and slave configuration, some hardware issues etc.

will this work well with other phones besides samsung? it won't sound as good. samsung phones have something called the scalable codec and this, their's, earbuds has support for it. upon connection to samsung phone, scalable codec will be selected by default. DO NOT CHANGE TO AAC. if you have poweramp, check audio -> hi-res output and you will notice it's using LDAC!! this could very well be the first TWS earbuds with LDAC! make sure in wearable app, set it to dynamic.

This may vary depending on your particular situation but I use these at least 30hrs a week at my job and the convenience is impossible to beat. So this is where I'm coming from.

The sound quality, like, wow. Really impressed with these.

You can't beat a wired pair. You just can't. I have a pair of FH5's and Sure 846's. The extra power (amps, wattage) they can inherently provide beats out anything currently available. In the end they all use similar drivers; it's the execution and the end result that matters and for a truly wireless set, I'm waiting for something to beat these...

As I'm not an audiophile, the sound is great for me although I understand that there are much better sounding buds out there - these are more than double the price. I'd say they sound somewhat better than Beats X bluetooth headphones if that helps.

Battery life is long and the charging case is compact enough to place in your small jean pocket.

Very comfortable and lightweight. I actually hurt my ears by using the smallest ear tips and pushing the buds right into my ears - dumb idea! The tipd just need to be placed in lightly and the earbuds hold firm which is great.

Cons:

Definitely the connectivity. The cutting out at first drove me insane but two updates in a week have seen a vast improvement in consistent connection; however, Samsung are still a couple of updates away from completely fixing this in my opinion.

The first day of owning them saw sound cutting out, echos and video lag. After two updates this had reduced significantly. If Samsung hadn't pushed out updates so quickly, I'd have returned them.

I'll hold onto them now as I believe they're working- and close to succeeding- with fixing the connectivity and lag.

Only then will they be a great product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Bluetooth connection was spotty and would cut out if I bent over, it was bad. HOWEVER, it turns out that it was just my set. I called Samsung, since they were still under warranty, and they sent me a new pair, perfectly functioning. They have, in my opinion, amazing battery life. I have only ever ran them all the way down once, and they last a day, guarantee for me.  That 6 hour battery life is legit. The call quality is pretty good. I've never had someone not understand me while using them for calls, and I have used them both inside and outside. As for fit, they do take a little getting used to. But if you do manage to find the right combo of wings and tips, then they seal your ear fairly well. I usually can't understand people talking to me if music is playing, and it is definitely muffle when there isn't music playing. The environmental awareness feature is ok, it really does just make stuff sound tinny, but for what it is intended for, it works. The touch controls are decent; sometimes if I don't tap enough towards the center of the touch pad, it won't read, but it is responsive once you get the hang of it. The wireless charging is absolutely ingenious. I have an ikea desk lamp with a wireless charger, and I just throw them on overnight, and that's that. There is a USB-C if that suits your fancy too. Finally, the sound quality. I think they are pretty good. I am no audiophile, so as long as you aren't OBSESSED with the sound quality, they will do just fine. They do have bass, contrary to popular belief, though it will not be bass you FEEL. What I mean is, you won't feel the bass as well as hear it, like with a sub-woofer or something. The ""equalizer"" in the wearable app does have a ""dynamic"" setting that provides the best balance in my opinion; the ""bass boost"" just lowers mids and trebles, so it isn't really great. Overall, they are an excellent set of headphones that I take literally anywhere, especially since they are so dang compact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Awful for calls.","Because of the lack of call quality I can only rate this 3 stars. If you don't make calls or have no need to use the buds for calls, these buds are an excellent choice!

When looking at earbuds, I look at sound quality, comfort, convenience, battery life, and call quality. The galaxy buds hit it out of the park with all but call quality. For the size, convenience, and price the sound quality if good. The buds are very comfortable and I can wear it for long periods of time. I've never had issues with battery life and the case is small and light so carrying it around is not an issue.

The real issue is the call quality. I cannot use the buds for phone calls. While I can hear calls just fine, the microphone has terrible quality and people on the other end have real issues hearing me. Other wireless buds like the Jabra 65t do not have this issue. This is a real shame because these are the most comfortable ear buds I've ever work and I would use it exclusively if the call quality was average or better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One of the first things to occur, was that i received a call from my friend who was using their cellphone at the time and the sound was clear on my end and they told me that it was clear on their end also! Next, i started playing music through the Buds from my cellphone and the sound was excellent in my view and as loud as i wished to make it. Obviously the premium sound provided by AKG for the Buds is top notch!! When i checked to see how depleted the charge had become on the Buds after several hours of use, it was much less than i expected it to be and the recharging time was negligible. Being able to converse with my friends, family and neighbors while i have the Buds in my ears is no problem at all. Also, once you get used to the touch controls on the Buds, it becomes second nature to operate them:) Two things happened to me, both inadvertent, both excellent positive review enhancers lol. First, when i opened the case outside to put the Buds back in before going upstairs, i dropped the open case on the sidewalk and it got a minor nick in it. I then went upstairs to check if it was OK and it and the Buds charged up flawlessly!!! As a retired machinist i noticed two things immediately. First, the case is made of what i believe to be aluminum, which makes it lightweight and second, it also makes it rust-proof:) Second thing to occur was that i was out walking the dog and got caught in a brief, but heavy rain shower, which soaked us and the Buds well, with no ill effects for us or the Buds:) I most definitely based on my usage and occurrences with my Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds recommend them highly! Thanks for taking the time to read my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had airpods before, loved them. However I found they were really easy to lose, which is exactly what happened. I lost them. Or maybe someone stole them? I'll never know.

So now I wanted new wireless headphones, but I didn't want to shell out over 150+ dollars just for some headphones. I admit the airpods are great, but are they worth over 150 dollars of my hard earned money for some wireless capabilities? I didn't think so.

So I tried the 30-50 dollar headphones, some were a hit or miss but most of them were a miss. If they had good sound quality, they had bad bluetooth connection. If they had good bluetooth connection, they had poor sound. You get where I am going with this.

So I decided to shell out a little bit more, and get the galaxy buds. This was the sweet spot that I was looking for.

The Pros:
-the sound quality is good-also in the app you can change the type of preset sound you want, such as soft, bass boosted, dynamic, higher treble, etc.
-they last a good while. The case charges them and they work seamlessly when you put them on and off. just like the airpods
-has wireless charging
-they are nicer looking than the airpods (in my opinion, because there's no awkward rod sticking out. Some people don't have the right ears for it and it looks really silly)
-and can fit ANY ear unlike the airpods
-they have noise cancellation. I turned it on and off with the app to see if it was true and it does have ACTUAL noise cancellation.
-decent price
-good touch commands(but this also can be a con)

Cons
-the commands arent really configurable or advanced. There's no swipe for volume or anything and you can only customize the long hold. The single, double and triple tap commands are locked in. Not a deal breaker but something to understand.
-build quality, although more expensive than the cheaper china-brand ones, seemed similar. There was not much glossy finish to make it look sexy(again not a deal breaker)

for those who want to just say they have the airpods for stature or want to show off to people, I'd say stick with the airpods. The airpods still I believe are the best tiny buds, in terms of SOUND QUALITY for music. However these buds are for those who want functionality, with practicality, at a reasonable price. I said the airpods didnt seem like they were worth the 150+ dollars spent. Galaxy buds however, are they worth the 100 dollars?...I'd say a solid yes","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It has a little hiccup here and there, but the buds perform well for the most part. Crisp sound and great battery life.
Durability wise, i've dropped them a few times and they don't even have a scratch. One key note is that when using the buds, I swapped out the ear wings for the flat wings just because the wings hurt after a long time, but other than that, Solid.

Bass is definitely lacking, and the boost from the Galaxy Wearable app improved it ever so slightly. When paired to my Apple iPod 7th Gen, the volume levels are maxed out to a medium-low. And with the Galaxy Buds long tap right/left controls to raise/lower the volumes are all but non-functional. The problem also occurs when synced to my Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop OS. Installing the Galaxy Plugins didn't help either.
I'm almost positive that the Buds would have had excellent sound with the Nano and I would have decided to keep them for that reason alone. It's probably just a flick of a switch in the firmware to make it possible and keep more customers from returning their products.

Updated on 6/7/2019
These were awesome! While they were working... They worked for 2 days flawlessly after the updating them before use.  then the third day I started noticing drop outs when the transmitter or the headphones are covered by anything from a thin fabric to your hands.. by the 7th day just turning my head and the wind blowing cut reception. There have been no updates since that first one. My $15 off brand 5.0 wireless buds work perfectly.. thru walls... around corners... with no stupid app and no updates. What are we.. Beta testing these things?
On my first call to Samsung they denied all knowledge of the many purchasers that are having the same problem. I was like ""Do you read your support forums?"" They determined they were defective because resetting them thru galaxy wear didn't work. (Speaking of Galaxy wear.. It's kinda stupid. It only works when paired to your phone. Useless when using any other device.) 2nd call to Samsung (different rep) he acknowledged all the ongoing issues, and that he was tired of making excuses for them LOL then he recommended just returning them to Amazon instead of going thru Samsung's RMA process to obtain a working pair because of the difficulty and the amount of time it would take.  Hmmmm... Not the answer I was expecting from Samsung's customer service. They don't even want to deal with it anymore. Probably because they are overwhelmed with their own returns of these.
So disappointed. I loved them for 2 days..
3 gripes while they were working..
#1 - They can only connect to one device at a time. My $15 off brand headphones have that option and its so convenient. We don't listen to music solely on our phones.
#2 - The charging port isn't micro usb.
#3 - I was intrigued by the Ambient Aware. To be able to control how much surrounding noise you want. It's great until the wind blows really hard at a certain angle, which wasn't bad when walking even tho I live in the Windy city but I'm an avid cyclist and with the Ambient Aware on, at any volume level while riding at any speed, the wind noise is horrible with your head looking forward in a constant headwind. Turn your head to either side and it goes away but you can't ride like that.
Ambient Aware will only work were there's no wind.. like the moon I guess?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First time I used them I had the same feeling. The sound quality was good, but the volume was too low to listen on the street, even setting to max the phone volume. But if you configure them to increase/decrease the volume with the touchpad (by default is used for the voice assistant) you will be able to increase the volume a lot. Once you do it, you can set the touchpad configuration back to the default and control it from the phone.

In my opinion this is a big usability bug that Samsung should fix asap because many people/reviewers are not noticing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_230?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=230&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The issue is when using them as a Bluetooth device for phone calls people in the other end hear a loud metallic clacking noise and can barely hear me. With out the ability to use them for phone calls these amount to a $130 paper weight, absolutely useless. Very disappointed. Not to mention the hoops I had to jump through with Samsung for the return.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Can't answer calls during the announcement of the caller a delay occurs after attempting to answer the call and you are disconnected.
2. My voice was not always clear when used for calls people said I sound muffled or very low.
3. Volume control will not work while talking to a caller the buds will give a strange sound and it will mute the call on your end and the caller cannot hear you. However the volume control works great when playing music only.
4. Sometimes the earbuds will cut out when bending down even if you have the phone in your pocket.

The problem I have at this point is what Samsung sent me was produced for the Spanish speaking market.  The quick start guide and warranty card are in Spanish.  No English version at all.  The box has a sticker on the box that says ""Guarantiza Samsung Uruguay.""  Though I took some Spanish in college and visited Spain a few times, I am not fluent in Spanish.

I work in a loud warehouse environment and these work just as well as normal war plugs and allow you to listen to music or podcasts or a book.

The speaker sound-quality itself is superb, and battery life is good, connectivity is excellent, and a TOTAL FAIL when it comes to the microphone. Everyone I speak with, and I mean everyone, hears all of the background noise in my area better than they can hear ME talking! It doesn't matter if its cars driving by, or the TV, or other people talking in the room several feet away from me... For example, a couple of friends were having a conversation in the same room as me, about 10 feet away, and they weren't talking loudly...and shockingly, my Dad told me that he could hear my friends talking better than he could he me talking to him while these lame earbuds were in my OWN ears!! I couldn't believe what all my friends were telling me until I game my friend my earbuds and my cell phone to use, and I took my friends cell phone and called myself, and I had a chat with my buddy using the Galaxy earbuds and my cell phone and its totally true...I can hear everything in the room going on as if it was a Batman type hearing aid to snoop on other people, and I could barely hear my friend who was wearing the earbuds and talking to me. Absolute garbage. I'm an IT engineer by profession so I worked through some basic diagnostics at this point. I tried to Google the issue for starters and shockingly the Samsung forums are plagued with reports of this same type of overly-sensitive microphone issue with no resolution other than Samsung forum moderators suggesting warranty replacements, for which many users tried to exchange their buds for another new pair and the issue persisted. On another website I found a user who suggested wiping your local cell phones Android call/phone/dial apps' cache and temp data (I tried it and it didnt work)... I even tried resetting and re-pairing my Samsung bugs to two other Android cell phones (a pixel and a sony) and the same overly-sensitive mic persisted. As a last resort, I was past my point of returning the buds, but my girlfriend wanted a pair of bluetooth earbuds so months after buying my own Galaxy Buds, I bought ANOTHER pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds for my girlfriend, and she had the same exact issue...this time I promptly returned the new/second pair of Galaxy Buds that I purchased. This is absolutely a design flaw, likely with the hardware itself, and I'm incredibly disappointed. This could have been an incredible product but the microphone is so sensitive that it makes all calling garbage and its even difficult for Google Assistant or Bixby to understand me in a room with low-noise but has a TV running for example. I love the audio quality, the battery life is good, the ergonomics are good, the storage/charging case is great, but the microphone is terrible and it keeps me from being able to use this device because I needed it for calls more than listening to music. I can't believe that Samsung does NOT care to remedy this issue or to issue refunds or something like that. I hope someone starts a class action lawsuit against Samsung over this obvious and common defect, as Samsung has been mute on this issue (if you dont believe me, search their forums and you'll see many, many people have this issue since product release and even recently with brand new devices). So if you want the Galaxy Buds PURELY for listening to music, they are great...but if you want the buds for any phone calls I would stay far, far away, even one-off occasional calls aren't worth making with these. Please take my word for it...if you need bluetooth headphones or buds for phone calls, this is NOT the product you are looking for. I am now researching and looking for another brand or model that will meet my basic needs of having a decent sounding call... Good luck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a few days I realized these things are not falling out, unless of course they are directly hit. I used the Beats X before these and the sound on Beats are very loud, that being said Galaxy Buds could use one or two more notches on the volume up button. They could be louder for me since I work in a noisey place, but they get the job done listening to Howard Stern everyday at work (BABABOOEY TO Y'ALL). For example if your on say a riding lawnmower these won't work at all sound wise, I use my OVER ear beats in that situation. These are snug, very sharp looking, and well worth the $125 price tag. Battery last all day during my 8-10hr workday, if you're not using em throw them in the case so they can charge wirelessly another great feature. Also the Galaxy Wearable App makes these customizable, bottom line must give these buds a 8.5/10 only the max volume hurts these in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

These are not for hands free talking. You will be able to hear your caller just fine. The sound on your end is great. However, your caller will be able to hear every single sound and noise in your background including hearing you swallow if you take a drink. Lol. They will not be able to make out what you're saying. I have not had one successful call with these. I was walking around the mall, I answered my friend's call. She could instantly tell something was off and different. My friend asked me what kind of 2003 Bluetooth device did I get and that I should throw them in the trash. And she wasn't the only call I've answered and my caller was like ""please disconnect me from your Bluetooth device"". So... Not for hands free talking. At. All.

Sound Quality - The sound, 5 out of 5. Beautiful sound quality. There's an equalizer with different options. I love the bass. It's very easy to become immersed in what you are listening to.

Noise Cancellation - These are ONLY for listening and possibly noise cancellation if you need it. The noise cancellation is 5 out 5. It actually concerned me at first because I couldn't hear ANYTHING in my surroundings. The ambient option helps you to be aware of your surroundings, other than that, be careful and be alert.

Battery - no complaints. It has always later as long as I needed. And when I'm not using them, I put it back in the case and it's at 100% again. 5 out of 5.

Bluetooth Connection - 4 out of 5. I'm not sure if it's the range, the walls, or when the battery gets low, but it makes this awful digital scrambling sound when the Bluetooth connection is breaking up. My apartment is a little less than 800 sqft. My phone can be in the living room, if I walk in the closet, the sound will scramble. I rated it 4 and not 3 because of the effortless connection. Just open the case and it automatically pairs to the phone. I have a Note 8.

Charging case - 5 out of 5. It's very small. I have clumsy hands so I have dropped it and lost it several times. Lol. That's a me problem though. It has the same c-type USB charging port. Super convenient.

Other functions - 4 out of 5. If you drop an earbud and can't find it. Click on where's my earbud and it will begin to beep louder and louder. I wish it did that for the whole case. The tapping functions to turn volume up or answer call (it's customizable) are fine. No real issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, don't get bogged down by loading Samsung's Galaxy Wearable App.  It sounds good but too many permissions are requested to access all aspects of your phone.  Totally unnecessary if all your interested in is listening to music and calling folks.  I do not know why their app gives you the opportunity to select which processes to access but in the end if you said no to any permission request it just dies and leaves you in the mud.

The case even has wireless charging so that I can keep it charged by just placing it down on my charging pad when I am not using the case with or without the buds inside. One of the coolest features is the Ambient Sound. When you are wearing the Galaxy Buds, normal sounds become muffled. The solution is Ambient Sound, you turn that feature on and you can hear everything around you! Even while listening to music you can have ambient sound on. It even has the ability to enhance people talking to help you hear people in loud environments. When using them to make phone calls, everyone can hear me clearly and the sound quality is amazing.

Features: The touch sensor on the device gets a little getting use to, but once you have the figuration set to your liking it very easy.  The pill box case is light and easily placed in a pocket, going to purchase a sleeve with a clip for it so i can have on my belt instead.
Sound: Great quality on the sound, once ear buds are in they pretty much cancel most of the background noise and the bass and clarity of what you are hearing is amazing.
Call quality: Now here is what makes the score drop. So when people call me I can hear them with such great clarity, however in most cases that can't be said about me.

That means Apple users are stuck with the out-of-the-box configuration. This may pose a problem for some.

The good:
The controls are fairly straight forward. I’ve listened to music and made phone calls. All were great sounding and clear. I’ve had people tell me how great the mic sounds.
They are comfortable. They ship with different sizes of inserts for a good fit.
They are sweat “proof.” I’ve heard this claim before and had other earbuds ruined by sweat. So we’ll see how these hold up in the long run. Airpods are not even sweat resistant. So they wouldn’t be my first choice for workouts.
They can work independently. You don’t need both buds in. They have the same configs right out of the box. So you can use just one if you need and not have to have a different set of controls.

The not-so-good:
You’re stuck with the configuration. The tap controls are easy. Play/pause, skip/reverse, answer/decline, etc. are all just tap sequences. Press and hold activates Siri.
There is no volume control on the buds. That is, unless you have an Android and can change the config. But, since this is a review for iPhone users, there is no volume control on the buds.
The quick-start directions are great for Android users. The case needs to be open and the buds inside it for it to pair. Some may already know this from other types of buds, but these are my first... and I had to Google it.

Are they good? Yes. Would I like them to be more Apple friendly? Yes. I’m going to keep them and just suffer through the volume control thing. The sweat-proofing and sound are more important to me.
You make the call for you. I didn’t see many iPhone reviews or information. So I wanted to share with others who may be looking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was very skeptical of these, but was dead wrong.  These buds have a sleek look coupled with an amazing sound quality that tops all others. They can get very loud and be super quite. At no point did the connection deter or fall.  Next question you may have is are they comfortable??? These fit perfectly in my ear.

Unfortunately,  negatives far surpass the positives.

PROS:
Design - I love the design. They fit completely in the ear without any ""extras"" dangling down like the Airpods
Fit - Extremely comfortable & stayed in my ears during my run without any problem. I have small ear canals & ear buds often hurt my ears. These did not bother me at all even after a few hours of wear.
iPhone Connection - It was easy to connect the Galaxy Buds to my iPhone by selecting them in my iPhone's Blue Tooth settings
Charging Case - case is compact, sleek & easy to operate

CONS:
Sound Quality - If you're a sound connoisseur these are definitely not for you. I bought these solely for running & to replace my Plantronics Backbeat Fit 300. The sound quality of the Galaxy Buds was notably inferior to the BB Fit. I was willing to compromise on sound for complete wireless convenience, but...
Noise Canceling - Non-existent. So much ambient noise bleeds through it's unbelievable. I wore these in the airport & could barely hear the music playing on my iPhone despite having the volume turned up quite loud.
Connection Issues - As I mentioned above, I bought the Galaxy Buds primarily for running.  I took the Galaxy Buds on my first run & paired them to my Apple Watch. The entire 3.5 mile run the Galaxy Buds snapped, crackled & popped. I can only guess they were having trouble staying connected to my Apple Watch which was on my wrist no more than 2 feet away at any time. I never had this issue with the Plantronics Backbeat Fit ear buds. For me, this was the deal breaker. By the time I finished my first mile I wanted to tear the Galaxy Buds from my ears & throw them in a ditch. The constant popping was unbearable. I turned the music volume up which helped to mask some of the crackling sound & was grateful I had only gone out for a short run.

Sadly, I'll be returning these little guys.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If I could take the best of the Jabra T65's and mix them with the Galaxy Buds, I'd have the best pair of true wireless headphones.

Overall:
1.  The comfort is the best on the market.  They sit in my ear without any pressure points.  They also come with other options to make them fit better in the ear.  I can't imagine someone not being able to work something out with the fit considering all the options.  They stay in my ears without any issues no matter what I'm doing.
2.  The sound isn't as loud as I would like but the quality is just fine.  If people are looking for the best sound quality, go ahead and pay twice the amount...just don't get on here and mislead people by saying the sound quality is poor.
3.  The app is just ok.  It's a couple of steps from a budget app done to make people think they are getting more for their dollar.
4.  Battery life is great.  Recharging from wireless is a huge plus.
5.  Bud holder is great!  Magnet really helps seat them properly.  Easy to open and stays closed when you want.

So why 2 stars?  Connection issues are terrible.  I tried everything I know.  The problem is so bad that I can touch my phone yet the music is skipping.  I've tried uninstalling the software, restarting the music, restarting the buds, updating the software, standing on one leg with my finger in the air, and tilting my head.  Nothing seemed to work.  I reached out to Samsung and let them know the problem and see if they had a fix.  They had me do the same thing over again except the tilt and finger thing.  The problem was no better.  I did some research and found out that Samsung knows of this issue.  Why on earth would they waste my time without telling me there is a known problem.  By the way, I have a new Samsung phone which should be a plus on the integration side of things.  I want the product to work as I love them.  Samsung, if you are listening, the team that designed the outside and the case did their job perfectly.  The group that designed the connection to the device should be fired.  I bought them to listen to music, not just wear in my ears like jewelry.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_219?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=219&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's not perfect, but great for my needs which is mainly wireless earbuds.  I went on a 5 hour flight and used them for majority of the time w/o having to charge them.  I can still hear the low hum of the plane, but I could barely hear the other passengers while the music is playing.  Would definitely need to try out the other plastic ear pieces to suit your needs. Indoor, the signal between my phone and the earbuds never gets lost. Using outdoors, it is mostly good than bad.  I had occasional loss of signal or warped sounds when out for walks or turning my head while the phone is in my pocket.  The touch control to use for volume isn't used much for myself. I didn't like the sensitivity when I need to do minor adjustments when I feel like it might fall out of my ear; I accidentally touch the button and it will either adjust the volume, pause the music, or go to next song. Inconsistent as well when testing out voice control.  But for myself, the major needs I wanted was for sound quality, length of battery last between charges, and it being wireless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wanted so much to like these. For the most part I do, with one overwhelming negative... they cutout. The more I use them the more I notice they cut out. Phone in your pocket and you lean over, cut out. Turn your head, cut out. Hand against your head, cut out. Any activity, except sitting at a desk, you can expect them to cut out. 83.5% of the time they stay connected, but that 16.5% drives me crazy. Maybe I'm expecting too much, maybe bluetooth technology isn't capable of meeting my expectations. I've tried every suggestion to improve this issue with no success. Have requested a replacement pair in hope that I got a bad set so will update review if those work out
Pro:
Great fit
Comfortable
Sound good
Look good
Wireless charge

Con:
Cut out
Want more volume (I can hear them over my mower, I just want the option to crank it to 11)

Simple. If you were expecting over the top headphones that are completly wireless your drunk, go home, dont buy wireless headphones right now.

The Sound is very good. Decent bass, ive heard people complain about the volume, but for me they are fine. Im not deaf and at full volume they are decently loud. Now at first i had connection issues with it breaking up, but if fixed itself soon after. The only thing i would fix is the charging cases battery life. Against the airpods 20 hours, 7 hours recharge time is nothing. But they have 6 hours playback time vs airpods 5. Though i have listened to airpods and the buds have slightly better sound quality and are better designed to isolate sound outside of you.

These buds also future touch pads on the side wich let you activate volume controls, ambient sound, pause / skip forward/ skip backwards/ play, and yes before the airpods 2 activate your voice assistant google or bixby. Overall a great headset for a being wireless.
 These also work with any android or apple device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a pair of the previous version and was never really impressed with the sound quality. I found there to be frequent connection issues or sound would just cut out for a few seconds if I moved wrong. With the new version, I have not experienced any of connection issues and have thoroughly enjoyed the higher quality sound. The range is much bigger and actually included some low end. I have a broad collection of music and have tried everything from dubstep to classical. These really do have a pretty nice sound. As usual, there are several sizes of earpieces to help dial in the fit. I tried mine out while running a chop saw and found them to be able to block out enough of the sound to keep me comfortable. One new feature that I really liked is the quick ambient mode. With this, you can just touch and hold an earbud to allow ambient sound in but it turns off when you release your finger. They do still have the ability to turn on full ambient sound as well, I just liked this addition better. I feel like the new buds are definitely an upgrade from the previous version and certainly worth considering if you are interested in upgrading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well done Samnsung.","EDIT: I am giving these an updated 4 star review. It happens randomly, but the Bluetooth connection gets choppy when only a couple feet away from the Buds. If I have my phone in my pocket and bend over or reach to grab something, the connection cuts in and out at random times. It has only happened a handful of times. So we'll see if it becomes a constant problem. The battery life is solid, however. I used them for 3 hours and still had 40% battery. I still stand by my initial review. They are great, but maybe need a couple bugs worked out still.

These things are amazing. I had purchased a $70 no name brand Bluetooth Airpod look alike. They were cheap garbage. They constantly lost signal and had terrible sound quality. They also didn't fit my ear and fell out multiple times. So I decided to drop the money on the Galaxy Buds. They have been well worth the money, at least so far. The difference is almost uncomparable. They came with the medium ear tip and wingtip installed. The Buds fit my ears perfectly right out of the box. The sound quality is insane and the connection is strong, with no loss of signal at all**see edit.

The ambient noise reduction is pretty damn impressive. The option to either turn on the ambient sound filter permanently or temporarily by holding the Bud is extremely useful. I have been using the Dynamic equalizer setting and have found it hard to hear certain sounds without the ambient sound option enabled. So I suggest experimenting with what sounds good to you so you don't have any safety issues. These things really do block a lot of sound.

They are incredibly easy to connect to a Galaxy device. Make sure to download the Galaxy Wearable app beforehand to make connecting even faster. After connecting and charging, I used them for over an hour straight and the battery was still at 90%. I will update on battery life in detail after more use. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase. If you are looking for new headphones and have the funds, I say buy a pair. I plan to update my review if anything drastic or alarming happens. But so far, I highly recommend the Galaxy Buds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When using ambient sound it worked well but now it shuts off one side of the bud. When in crowded areas it's difficult for people to hear me on the other line. On the plus side these are very good for the gym and jogging or even to watch a movie on your phone. No lag when using it on my note 9. Really good just needs better quality for conversation during calls.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_221?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=221&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you're wearing both earbuds, they definitely block out most outside noise. They fit pretty snugly, but there can be a little discomfort after wearing for a couple hours.

There have been occasional moments where the connection between the earbuds and phone drops out, but it has reconnected right away. Also, a few moments where the earbud's audio seem to stutter.

The touch controls are simple and aren't finicky, but it will take some getting used to where on the earbuds you touch. Battery life is also pretty close to what is advertised.

For the price, they're fine, but if you're looking for the highest quality sound, you should probably look elsewhere.

The case itself is a little bulk but you can fit it in most back pockets. When you open the case they instantly connect to your phone. The touch controls on the buds are very responsive, pause play volume up down etc. They're very comfortable to and sit deeper into your ear so they don't stick out to far. They have a galaxy wearable app in the play store make sure to download it, that's where you set the ambient noise to block or allow outside noise into the buds. Most importantly in the app set the equalizer to DYNAMIC, i repeat set it to DYNAMIC or music will be super flat.

I'm 6'5"" and 270ish, I have a moderate gut and wide shoulders, which unfortunately makes it almost impossible to have my phone in my pocket *and* move around. When idle or when walking it's usually fine, but if I take these out for a run, or want to do chores around the house I have to fit my phone to a wrist mount or place it somewhere on high. They *definitely* sacrificed range on these.

That being said, the bass is nice and the highs and mids are crisp. Microphone works well, but seems to have intermittent connection issues for the above mentioned reasons. I didn't have to use any of the alternate sizes of earbud or wingtip to get a nice snug fit. You can tell them R&D'd the crap out of the twist-in design, you get a perfect seal everytime. The hear through function is basically necessary, even with only one earbud in, if you're gonna talk to someone. The use of touch controls is very welcome, as previous ""true wireless"" earbuds that had physical buttons always felt like plunging my ear whenever they were pressed. The tap is sometimes unresponsive, but you learn quickly that there's a sweet spot that needs to be hit. Still annoying that occasionally you have to try three or four times when out on a run, and it looks a little silly. I tend to use the pause and long press for assistant functions exclusively (it's not that hard to pull out your phone lol)

The fact that each bud can be used independently is really neat, but not without flaws. Occasionally when watching video one of the two buds will lag behind the other and there's a jarring distortion that you can't really ignore. Rarely, one of the buds will not connect when switching from single to dual, and won't respond until you put it back in the charging case and then take it back out. It's never persisted past that initial reset, so I'm not exactly taking any points off for that.

The battery life is adequate, the time to charge is not all that great but not at all bad. About 3 hours of nonstop use, at full volume; roughly an hour to charge the whole case, and roughly an hour to charge a bud back to full power. If you wanted to, it's perfectly feasible to use one at a time for ~12 hours of uninterrupted use. The ""in ear, in use"" sensor works fairly well, but lags quite a bit when taking the buds out before disabling the touch controls. It's more for battery preservation than anything else.

There's a lot of confusion online about the samsung app that goes along with these earbuds. *you do not need to install anything to get these to work*. The main reason one would *need* to install the samsung app is if you wanted to fine tune the use of the hear through function, which can be set once and then the app uninstalled.

at ~140 I'd put these a fair cut above the competition, Jabra's offerings are over priced and I dont even wanna start with apple earbuds (they're basically expensive trash by comparison). Despite the persistent issues I have with connection I wont be returning these, I consider that an unavoidable burden with tech this small. I would (and have) recommend(ed) these to a friend, but like it says in the title here, be aware if you are larger in frame.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just don't use them in any water (no sweat.)","I actually love these! They are so very small and very comfortable. You forget that you are wearing them! I have fallen asleep wearing them. They charge pretty well too! They are so small as well in their case.

I love the fact that you can use only one at a time and they are intelligent enough to know that you have taken one out

Only one problem.

ABSOLUTELY NOT WATER OR DUST PROOF AT ALL

if you sweat, you better take them out and clean them.
They released them a little too quickly or something. They are the absolute best for all but wearing them in the rain, doing workout, or in the shower. They are so very invisible once they have been in your ears that you forget to remove them in the shower.

I suppose that I have to make some compromises. when I need to be waterproof I can use my other earphones. The other earphones have a wire between them. Kinda silly that the galaxy gears are much more waterproof and old, but they cost a LOT more money than these.
They are very small in your pocket. Use them for anything you want unless you sweat a lot. No swimming or bathing. I will use them daily in my work! I do not get wet in any way at all.

Tldr, they are extremely amazing! Don't get them wet. Bass is good enough. The apps equalizer is good. I adore the fact that you can control each one individually and the noise canceling is pretty fantastic for the size","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Horrible Customer Service Policies","Bought these and was quite happy with the easy use, pairing, and functions within. Prior to the event causing me to contact customer service, I would have rated these at 4 stars.

About a month after purchasing these, I was on a hike in some mountainous trails in Colorado. While placing the charging pill, with the earbuds inside, in my pocket, the pill slipped an hit the ground. When the pill is ever dropped, the headphones go flying 3+ ft. Well both the headphones and charging case fell into rock crevices around us. We were able to find the charging case and one headphone, but unable to find the other. What we recovered still work, pair, and charge just fine (just with one headphone). I tried to contact Samsung Support on multiple occasions to see about getting a replacement bud for the one I lost. SURPRISE: Samsung refused to work me on getting a replacement. I was told that there was no way to get (and I even asked specifically about purchasing one) a replacement. I couldn't send them what I have, then pay the difference (as I'm sure they can refurbish mine and/or provide me a refurbished bud and just pair it with mine). No options, simply told ""You have to buy another pair"". For a device that essentially explodes into its pieces when dropped from 3 feet, being unable to request or replace an individual component seems like a money-grabbing business policy instead of working with customers willing to pay for the missing piece.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Treble- 10
Bass - 7.8 [not surprised but they are good thou, not perfect but they are buds so maybe it's perfect based on price and technological limitations]
Mids/Vocals - 9 [damn right]

So here's some quick pros n cons while i'm here;

Pros:
- easy to pair and the App is very intuitive
- the carrying case is perfectly sized and if you been reading online or watching videos you know the S10 line can charge it via the case wirelessly and it uses USB C!!! lol so nice
- Like i mentioned before the sound is pretty good, i paid 120bucks and i'm not mad, i spent way more for less quality in the past.

Cons - sound quality for all i know could be better, i just based it as good in comparison to all the other non popular buds out there.
- it works seamlessly with Samsung devices but not with apple, little glitches here and there but nothing major. just shows either apple don't like buds or samsung purposely made them to glitch with apple.... both parties suck IMO....

that's all for now [05/24/2019] i'll update if something happens or i discover something. as for now, they get my vote of approval [for droid users anyways] apple users stick to your Airpods, why even try it when it will glitch from time to time more often than not?

When I listen to music, I wanna go deaf.  I'm not kidding.

That being said, the sound quality really depends upon your source.  I listen to just about any type of music (no rap, no country, no jazz).  So I fired up a few different genres and tried different settings with all of them.  Keep in mind that the bitrate makes a huge difference.

A few bits of music I listened to with these headphone:

1.  Judge Jules Creamfields - 2000 - Old school trance - This sounds great but it wasn't loud enough.  This is Trance Energy and I like it loud.  Sound quality for this oldy was pretty damned good, just wish it was louder.

2.  Hans Zimmer - Da Vinci Code - Chevaliers De Sangreal - FLAC format.  The song gives me the chills but the bass was slightly washed out and the highs were absent.  Also, it wasn't loud enough for me.  DAMN!  This song is a great song to test a sound system with and these earbuds were a 5/10.  So unfortunate.

3.  Simple Minds Live - FLAC format -  Just not loud enough.  Could use a little help with the highs as well.  The lyrics were drowned out by the music.  Disappointed with this one.

4.  Van Halen - Runnin With the Devil - Cuz I love David Lee Roth.  This is a 3.43mb MP3.  Everything sounds great with this song.  My only gripe... VOLUME.  I wanna hear Diamond Dave SCREAM but that's not happening with these.

5.  The Church - Reptile - My only complaint...  I'm not deaf yet.  Okay...  The bass was a little dull but not terrible.

6.  The Police - Synchronicity II because it's bad ass.  Sound is a bit washed out on this 6.07mb MP3 but it's okay.

7.  Grateful Dead - Sugaree 1977 live - It's about as loud as you'd want for this song... eh... maybe not.  It's a little washed out but what do you want from a 1977 recording?  Okay so I realized for this song I was on Bass Boost.  Taking off of Bass Boost and putting the head phones into Dynamic mode makes a HUGE difference (No longer washed out).  Still could be louder though.

8.  David Bowie - Heroes -  Sounds okay - The Man Who Sold the Word sounds about the same.  Two of my favorites from Bowie.

9.  Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen We are floating in Space - Never heard of Spiritualized?  This is a great band to test out new headphones with.  Such a complex song.  The dynamic mode works for this song and sounds great.  Bass boost mode isn't too shabby either.

10.  Pink Floyd - Sorrow (Pulse) - It's my favorite post Waters song; might even be my favorite Pink Floyd song ever.  Dynamic mode is best but it needs to be louder.  Guitar solo at the end of the song needs to make me deaf and it wasn't happening with these.  :(  Overall, the sound was pretty damned good for this recording.  Anyway, I'm sure this isn't the song you wanted me to review so let me review TIME (DSOM Studio version)...  This sounds absolutely amazing but for some reason, the headphones keep cutting in and out.  (I'm writing this review real-time.  I wonder if the earbuds are overheating, it's getting annoying?)  *Update an hour later and it's no longer cutting in and out (Sounds amazing just wish it was louder).

11.  Echo & The Bunnymen - People are Strange (Doors Cover).  Who does the Doors better than the Doors?  Echo...  This song sounds great.  Only gripe?  You guessed it, I'm not deaf yet.

12.  ColdPlay - A Rush Of Blood To the Head - Live - This sounds absolutely phenomenal.  Even the volume was loud enough.  Vocals are crystal clear, music is perfect...  Everything is excellent.  Dynamic Mode.  I had to listen to another one of these from the same live show to see if it was still perfect.  Politik - Sounds is absolutely amazing.  Blew me away.  If every song I've reviewed was as crisp and clear as these, I'd given a 10 star review.  WOW!

13.  Radio Head - Creep - not bad, not as loud and crisp as the Cold Play I just listen to but it's good.  Needs to be louder.

14.  Darude (Trance) - Finland - Old School Trance Energy - Sound is pretty good.  Just wish the highs were a little higher and crisper.  Overall I'd give this a 6/10. Tried different modes but Dynamic Mode sounds best.

15.  Bon Jovi - Livin' On a Prayer - Crisp good sound.  Greatest hits...  Sounds great, bass could be a little better but the highs are high and the dynamic range is pretty good.  Same thing for Wanted Dead or Alive.  Nice sound, you won't be disappointed.

16.  U2 - The Unforgettable Fire - Sounds kinda dull so I tried another U2 song from a much newer album... Achtung Baby - Love is Blindness.  Sounded much better but still, there's an awful lot of bass in this song and I think the highs and lows are getting lost.  Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses Sounds better but still, the bass is a bit washed out.

17.  Sir Paul - Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey - This sounded just fine.  Dynamic mode and Bass boost mode although dynamic was a bit more... dynamic (It expanded the highs a bit and got rid of the slight muffle).

18.  Metallica - Master of Puppets - So unsatisfying.  This is the remastered version on spotify.  Sounds great but this needs to be LOUD and it's not.  Same with, Enter Sandman.  Ride The Lightning - NOT LOUD ENOUGH.  WTF.  This needs to be much louder.  Even the live version was not loud enough, however, sounded pretty damn good.  ""One"" Live sounds pretty damn good.

That's all for now.  I reviewed a bunch of various genres in real time.  Here's the thing.  I find that the recording and bit rates are going to have a major factor with whether you can appreciate these or not.  Since I'm not an audiophile, I'd have to say that you'll experience similar disappointment with any headphone that's not geared for a specific type of music.

Overall, I'd have to say these are a 3.5 out of 5.  They need a little work.  I'm listening for a few hours now and I'm at 70%.  of a 95% charge.  That's not too shabby.

I had a phone call which wasn't a great experience.  The person on the other end asked if I was on a speaker phone.  I asked if I was coming in clear and they said, ""Yes but it sounds like I'm on speaker"".  The caller wasn't as clear as my 4yr old Plantronics earpiece either.

I'll come back in a few days and give another review.  This is my first day with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Two of the best features are the ability to wear either bud singularly, and be able to answer calls. (JLAB Air only allow calls from the right bud). And secondly, the fit. Between the 3 different size bud cushions, and the 2 different size fins, I was able to find a fit that was secure, and that I would have no problem wearing all day! Most other features are average, but about the same as other brand, cheaper buds (i.e. sound quality, battery life, quick pairing, charging case, etc.). The final straw for me was that the buds would lose connection when my phone was in my pocket, and I was outside walking. After researching, this is a common problem, and a complete deal breaker for me, because I use buds a lot when walking / working outdoors, and can not keep my phone in my hand! I have several different brand sub $60 ear buds, and not one of them has this problem! Because I have experienced less than stellar product support from Samsung with my Gear S3 Frontier watch battery life (a whole different problem with Samsung - Google it if interested), I didn't dare keep these beyond the return policy hoping for a fix! I caught myself accepting ""average"" performance from these buds because I wanted them to be good, but finally realized that if I was going to accept average performance, why do it for $149, when the JLAB Air buds are as good, and $100 cheaper!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros
- The pairing is flawless and as a person who understands technology, it is magical.
- Battery life has been great.
- The ability to use each individually is fantastic.
- The range: When I first got these, I popped them in and took the dog for a walk. It felt light every time my body got in the way they cutout. As of right now, I cannot replicate that. What I did do was lay my phone down in the farthest corner of my home and walk to the other side. Through 5 walls and many appliances, I was still able to pause and play music with no cut outs.
- Looks, these don't look like ear rings like the Air Pods.

Cons
- The sound quality is not bad but it is a little more treble focused than bass, even with the equalizer on. With there were custom EQ settings (this could be added later).
- The app is kind of hard to get too... Not that big of a deal
- No battery (good) battery indicator for the case (wish I had % left).
- Ambient noise works to a degree but still could use tweaks.

I carry these bad boys everywhere because it's so easy to just pop one in and listen to music or a podcast anywhere. They are hardly noticeable and have not fallen out of my ears yet. Pick these up if you have a Galaxy phone. These are sweet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've owned everything from iPods, to Apple Watches to the iPhone X. I still think they are great products. However, I switched to Samsung about 6 months ago. Why? Well, I don't want to paint myself into any corners and with the ease of trading in phones I figured I'd give Samsung a try in case I was missing anything.

Boy, was I missing things. IMO, Samsung is just far easier to set up. Samsung has more apps and abilities for me personally. Samsung is just overall better in nearly all facets of this game.

Now, on to these ear buds. In summary...I love them. They are as close to perfect as anything you'll ever buy under $200. (I paid $129). The fit is great. The sound quality is fantastic. I don't consider myself a sound snob, but these are clear and loud. I have seen some reviews complaining about the loudness, but I think these people didn't realize that you can adjust the loudness settings via the app. And how great is it that as soon as I opened up the case they found and paired with my Samsung Galaxy Note 9? How great was it that I was able to open my laptop and see that my ear buds were an option without having to do anything? I mow the lawn with these. I work out with these. I sit at my desk and listen to music while at work with these. If you're considering these or the Jabra's or Apple Earpods...just get the Samsung. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As with many other users on Samsung forum, sound quality is good locally, but the other person on a call hears pops/static/garbage. (Users report this problem remains even after reset & exchange for new pair!)

As a user of AirPods, Nuheara IQBuds, and Sony WH-1000XM3s, I am now using these as my daily drivers with good sound on “Dynamic” mode in the Equalizer within the Galaxy Wearable app. Sound quality isn't as good as my WH-1000XM3s, but these are certainly more discreet and appropriate for one-bud driving and work.

- Initially upon pairing with my Note 9 and testing with my favorite testing song (you have one, right?) the volume was simply too low. I tried everything but couldn't get it to go to more than maybe 50% volume even though the system said they were maxed.
LOW VOLUME FIX: Had to go into Android “developer settings,” check “Disable Absolute Volume” and reboot… only then was the volume fixed. Pairing with iPad Pro 11 and iPhone X had no volume issues and good sound.

- Good overall balance between price and quality.  On the Dynamic setting, sound is similar to Apple airPods.  AirPods can sound artificially “processed,” which is not the case in the Galaxy Buds.

- Although these aren't actively noise blocking, the design blocks enough that people will have to shout for you to hear them.  For the sound blocking to be effective (and to have good bass) you must rotate the buds after you place the tip in your ear to put them in the correct position in the ear canal.  Rotate counter-clockwise for the optimal fit.

- We tested call quality and microphone quality by calling my teenage daughter's phone. She said my airPods sounded like I was talking through a bag, and Galaxy Buds sounded clear. Good enough!!

- We expected ambient sound control similar to Sony WH-1000 series or Nuheara IQBuds, but Galaxy Buds controls were primitive and less effective by comparison.  Ambient sounds coming in are mixed in but sound tinny… not a big issue for me, but the Sony WH-1000Mx3 win the prize here with ambient sounds mixed in that sound natural with “focus on voice” settings that actually work, unlike the same setting for these Galaxy Buds, which seemed to have very little effect.

- Ambient sound is only needed when both earbuds are in, so the option is greyed out if only one is in.  [NOW FIXED: There's a software issue with ambient sound where if you only use one bud after having both in, ambient sound controls cannot be turned back on even if you then place both in your ears.]

- Volume control can be configured with long-press on the left (volume down) and long-press on the right (volume up).  If you only use one bud at a time, this doesn’t work of course. Interestingly, volume appears to be independent of the Android's media volume setting (i.e., you could max media volume on your phone and then turn it up even louder with the earbuds)

- Battery life is good… can easily get full day alternating left/right, and battery percentage shown in Galaxy Wearable app is often visible.  You cannot see the case’s charge except in 1/3 increments.  When the case is unplugged, open the case and then close it again.  The front LED will show green, yellow, and red for rough charge left in the case.  Using both earbuds all day should theoretically be possible since there should be 2+ charges in the case, providing 18 hours of play (17 hours in my tests) before everything dies. Like the Nuheara IQBuds, you can't turn things “off” when charging in the case, so eventually things will likely run out even if you're not using them.  Definitely use a higher amp base charger to charge the case quickly.

- Size is easily as good as airPods for the case slipping into a pants pocket. However, the slick non-textured case surface means it could slip out of my pocket while seated or lying down.

- Can locate a lost bud though Galaxy Wearable app, but just as with iOS and airPods, you cannot locate the base (which you'll recall likes to fall out of pocket due to its slippery surface)

- The Galaxy Buds reads notifications?  Yay! Right? We expected functionality similar to free Android app “Out Loud” by hillman apps, which can read your text messages or Facebook messages or other notifications out loud. Sadly, the Galaxy Wearable provided only very basic functionality, only reading app name and no details.  (So instead of reading the full text message, it says only “Messenger.”) Not very useful.

- Overall… I've been waiting for someone to come along with something better than the Apple airPods, and I've always been disappointed that no one could beat the airPods -- until now. I'm now using these every day. Many of the issues above can be resolved with firmware/software updates, so I'm more than pleased with the capabilities and quality in this (early but related to consumer) state.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Before purchasing these about a week ago, I owned the JLab Audio JBuds Air for almost a year. They didn't break or anything, but it was definitely time for something more in line with what I wanted.
I purchased these for $100 at T Mobile along with my Galaxy Note 10 (it was $30 off since I was buying the phone the same day)...I got them in back because I want to be discrete when I am wearing them, plus it matched my phone lol.
I love that they have wireless AND wired charing capabilities and that there is an app (the standard Galaxy Wear app) that allows you to change the settings like what happens when you press the touchpad and sound quality. What I also love about these that the JLab Audio JBuds Air didn't have is independent use of each bud!! I love that I can use the right without the left and vise versa. I also like the LED lights to represent battery life and the light beeps to indicate they are on and connected. I am so used to headphones having the verbal ""Power On"", ""Earbuds joined"" and ""Bluetooth connected"" spoken to you that the beeps almost made me think it wasn't working (LOL)...
Overall, I have only had them a week and notice a huge difference from my last true wireless headphones. I don't get ear fatigue if I have them in longer than a few hours, they aren't huge and bulky in-ear (they fit like a glove), I trust that when they are in; they're in, the battery life of the buds and the case is good (plus I can charge it with my phone if  I am in a bind!), they don't cut out with my phone in my pocket and they dont slip and slide when Im all sweaty!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_271?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=271&reviewerType=all_reviews"

PROS: Great sound quality, very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, the wireless charging case is pretty cool (just set it on one of those charging plates), pairs up VERY quickly with my iPhone, and obviously the fact that it's wireless. I can blow dry my hair and get ready in the morning listening to music without having to worry about wires.

CONS: The only con to me is that the volume could be a little bit louder. I was able to somewhat fix the issue by going to the EQ controls on Spotify and switching it to ""Acoustic"". The EQ controls of the iPhone itself don't help with anything, but on Spotify it did make it a little louder.

I love these earbuds, as an iPhone user I couldn't be happier (the airpods are freaking ugly with the weird stem coming out of it) -  I am EXTREMELY happy with my Galaxy Buds, definitely recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality in my opinion is of clear quality, although I would like more volume. These buds fit much more comfortable than the last version as they are not near as bulky, they also come with different sizes of ear pieces. I'm still trying to figure out all of the new features besides being able to wirelessly charge and ambient mode is great though there are still connections issues because of the sensors. The battery life is definitely a big improvement, the charge lasts a good 8hrs plus after the battery is depleted from the buds you can put them back in their case for an additional charge without having to plug them in. Last but not least the bluetooth connectivity reaches a pretty good distance before disconnecting from device, It took me a bit of time to figure out how to pair my device because there was no installation guide since Samsung has chosen to go green.

I wear mine while working out and they stay in nicely without wiggling their way out!
I had trouble initially getting them to sync with my Samsung phone, using the Galaxy Wearable app, but after a 20 minute chat conversation with Samsung Customer Service (where they first told me the problem was with my phone :/) we determined the earbuds needed to be tapped ""on"".

Not complete noise cancellation, but close when playing music. Exceptional crisp sound, best I have heard on any buds.

They are super easy to setup with a Galaxy S10, took them out of the box and the phone recognized them and connected.  The sound quality is good and the fit is very comfortable.

Then I started getting software updates and dutifully updated the buds and that is when it went down hill.  First of all I lost connectivity to the left bud, got it back after I let it sit overnight and then during an important phone call, both buds lost connection.  I had to scramble for a pair of wired headphones and hope the person didn't notice I was completely off line.  That has been very disappointing.

I owned a pair of Jabra elite 65t's and so I'm kinda compairing. Samsung's sound is pretty good, I been listening for the last 5 hours at a somewhat elevated volume. The left one lasted longer at 25% right one 15%. The signal kinda got fuzzy once or twice but quickly corrected itself. I had to change the eartip and piece that fits into my ear to the larger one that made the sound much better. I don't like the touch pad on the earbuds as it makes it too easy to pause the music accidentally. Downloaded the app for earbuds from Google play that helps. Oh, and when you turn it up loud the treble seems just a bit too high the music is not even. It has good bass to me. But honestly Jabra elite are awesome the only issue was they just slightly too big for my ear and after awhile uncomfortable but the sound is amazing even without the eq. But still I feel like I'm settling with the galaxies. It's like driving a Camry after driving a Lexus ehh!

:They paired very easy with my Note 9 and the switching from right bud to left bud is smooth.
:Charge fast and long battery life.
: Great sound quality
: Sensor is amazing, Stops music when taking them out your ear and touchpad is sensitive but works great.
: Good for running or playing basketball, fit in ear good and dont fall out.

Cons:
:Ambient sound isn't the best. To hear anyway talking you need to be really close or have sound really low.

Cons - they aren't that loud, and I haven't figured out how to turn them up further, the bluetooth will cut out relatively easily if your phone is in your pocket our you're near something else electronic or moving too much. I got the headphones for active situations, however it's almost impossible to listen and do anything with too much movement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Poor bass response.","I got these Galaxy Buds to use with my iPhone, because Airpods unfortunately don't fit my ears.

I was quite impressed as I unwrapped the beautiful looking box. The design of the packaging, the charging case and the buds themselves is excellent. Pairing even with a non-Samsung phone is quick and easy, and putting the buds in is intuitive. I was pretty happy with my new purchase so far. They look and feel great.

However, once I started playing some music through them is when the disappointment hit. These buds (at least the specific ones I received) are completely unable to reproduce bass. Sounds in the highs and mids are decently represented, even higher bass notes sound pretty good, but once you get to the lowest frequencies, there's just nothing. I tried the various accessories to improve the fit but nothing improved the frequency response. Even the various cheap wired earbuds I have do way better reproducing the full spectrum of music. I don't know why some people are raving about the sound quality of these things. Did I get dud buds? Anyway, I will be returning them and hoping for a better sounding product with equally good design to come along some day.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a month the right earbud lost 80% volume. Look it up its an issue. I added the app, updated firmware, did everything on the forums and youtube to correct the right earbud. Let the wife have at it on her Iphone, my Pixel 3, everything thrown at them.

So instead of just returning them we went to Samsung, sent in for warranty instead of Amazon and now they have not sent any replacement for several weeks. I got one month of use. I sent them in to Samsung for warranty and now I guess i have to fight for the replacement set??? I have no earbuds working or not now.

 I would say its been a horrible experience with both the product and the manufacturer, don't buy Samsung Buds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, I had to go online for setup instructions as the documentation was all in another language (I'm assuming Uruguay as that is what the outside packaging reflects - even though U.S. is advertised here on Amazon).
After charging the Buds completely and ensuring all updates have been installed,  no one could hear me if there was the slightest outside noise (a oscillating room fan, on low setting 10 feet away, prevented people from hearing me) and if I was in a completely silent room,  I sounded muffled to everyone.
The Buds, however, felt good in the ear and were fairly loud but had zero bass even though the settings were all correct.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After I paired the buds to my galaxy s10, it opened up tons of features. There are several smart options, like single touch for play or pause, double touch, triple touch and press&hold. I am really loving it. Sound quality is amazing. And the range of these buds are pretty awesome. Bluetooth connection is very strong, I did not have any signal drops until now. I love that I can accept phone call with a tap, and hang up the call with another tap. Battery life is very good. And the addon battery on the case is pretty awesome.

Bottom line is Galaxy Buds are very comfortable, amazing sound, and tons of great features.

I would recommend the galaxy buds to friends and family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The battery life is good
Small and can't really feel them when you are wearing them.
Stay in place while wearing them, no issues of them falling out.

Cons:
The connection between my Samsung Galaxy S9+ and the buds can get choppy at times especially when I have my phone in my pocket. Seems like it has to have a direct line of sight between phone and earbuds.
The sound quality is ok at best. Don't expect to much from the ear buds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_237?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=237&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are very comfortable in the ear and I was suprised by the sound quality. The battery life is great and they are very responsive. As soon as you open the case they connect to your phone. One thing I didn't like however was that the controls for things besides music are a bit confusing. It takes some time to get used to. I've hung up on people too many times when I meant to answer the call. Oh well. The noise cancellation is decent, I would imagine it being better if I switched to the larger buds. Finally, I don't like leaving the ambient sound on, as it's distracting when I'm listening to stuff but I like the feature where you can touch the buds and ambient sound temporarily activates. Unfortunately, this feature can only be activated at the expense of volume controls. If they can find a way to incorporate both of those controls at the same time I'll be very happy. Otherwise the price is way better than comparable true wireless earphones, and they seem to be much more compact and comfortable. I would definitely recommend these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_222?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=222&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 Edit: Using Galaxy Buds while gaming has been better, there's less lag which is GREAT! Also I would have liked a more bass like sound like the wires AKG ones because that is what's different. Also wired ones are more comfortable and smaller. I know these buds are little bulgier because of the battery inside but of you working out you will need to push them back in and dry them because they can get slippery. I would liked some other type of a hood on the bottom to put it in place because of third time they did fall out sadly. It's also easy to connect and YES THEY ARE LOUDER THAN THE WIRE ONES IF YOU TURN ON THE BUDS OWN VOLUME.

Getting them hooked up to my phone was simple and very quickly I was up and running. These buds produce a great sound and have a very good feel in your ear. They don't feel like they are going to come loose or fall out. I like the Ambient sound mode. It doesn't always pick up voices but does allow you to be able to listen to the world around you and still hear your music. The microphones work well, i only had one instance where I think it was more of a bad connection rather than the buds. Overall i have been very satisfied with the Galaxy Buds and would recommend them to anyone looking for wireless ear buds. My only problem is with the touch button options I end up pausing my music when adjusting the Buds. While you can customize one of the options for the button on the buds there isn't more options to change the application.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_209?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=209&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At 130$ it is definitely a good price comparable to say the AirPods at 160$. I have used this earbud on both apple and android devices (my Samsung S7) and the sound is noticeably different. It sounds slightly better on my S7 than my iPad. But regardless connecting to either device was simple and it works flawlessly. In terms of lag or latency there is no lag at all or if any it's very minimal. On my S7 both YouTube and Media apps such as Twitch, spotify, and streaming services work well and has no lag. For my iPad however, the YouTube has a significant audio delay when watching video. The lips do not sync with the audio and can be quite a bother. But that was the only issue I has with Apps, as for any other streaming media apps it worked fine and without latency.
For battery, I was really impressed. It truly lived up to the 6hr battery life. The buds worked independently and that means you can use one and keep the other in the case to extend uses. Both the L and R earbud can be used like this and makes it nice compared to some where only one is functional when the other is not in use. For connectivity, I always found that if I was using my s7 it would remember the device and pick back up when I open the case. It was different for my iPad, where I had to manually go to settings and select the buds to connect via bluetooth. Not a dealbreaker as it only took maybe 10s at most to connect but it may take 1 or 2 tries.
In terms of sound quality, it is average. Sound by AKG works well but it is nothing extraordinary. Bass is mediocre & a bit flat imo but the buds works well in all other areas. Also at times I can hear a slight hissing/white noise but I noticed if I didn't use the dynamic setting in the Galaxy wearable app (only for android) it went away. So I just listen to the buds without any enhancements as my ears are sensitive and rather not hear the white noise. For ambient sound it is a nice feature to have (once again I was only get it able to work via the app for android) but it's quite gimmicky. I found you can hear people talking but it tends to pick up on loud sharp noises. I use these in the gym and would often hear it pick up weights sliding/dropping/or equipment moving around and it picks these sound up and makes them very sharp and loud, like high pitch and often hurt my eyes. So I don't even use this feature in the gym and just prefer a touch to pause and remove a bud.
There are many pros and cons, but one particular con I had was with using these outdoor. I noticed that leaving my phone in my pocket and simply walking outside often made the buds stutter. It's not even slight but can hiccup pretty badly. Using it indoors however I don't have this problem and can keep my phone maybe a good 30ft without stuttering. Overall, a solid price earbud works well but sound is average. If you are looking for sound best to consider putting a few more bucks into higher entry earbuds. These are my opinion and coming from use based on ShureSE215 & SE31sound wise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like that I can really move around and they still stay put. Also, the sound quality is insane. The noise-canceling is out of this world, they literally block all the sound. I think there is an app you can connect these headphones into and control the amount of noise canceling if its too much for you but I'm not sure because I have an iPhone and the app is only for Samsungs but just the fact that there is an app that also works with these sounds awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They're actually great! For the size and what they are, I think audio sounds good. They provide pretty good noise cancellation and the ambient sound feature works decently well. They connected quickly to my Galaxy S9+. Also connected to my Windows 10 laptop without much fuss. I do have a problem, though. I had to switch the ear tips out to the smallest ones, which fit me great - my issue lies with the wing tips. I have pretty small ears. The medium wing tips aaaaalmost fit, they keep the earbud super secure in my ear, except the wing tip tends to dig into that fold in my ear and makes them extremely sore after wearing for only 10-15 minutes. Think of how it feels to wear on-ear headphones for hours at a time - that's how my ears feel after 10-15 minutes. The Buds come with wing tips that are completely flat, but I find they don't stay in my ears nearly as well without some kind of wing. At one point, with the flat ""wings,"" my Wearables app thought I only had one Bud in because they were slowly slipping out of my ear. I'm really bummed about this. I don't fault Samsung because it's a personal problem, I just have very small ears, but it makes me sad because I love these things otherwise. I haven't decided whether I'll return them or not, but I probably will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They frequently cut out when playing music for no apparent reason. The volume is set very low at the factory and the only way to increase it is through the phone.  I do not like to max out the volume on the phone, but have no other choice except to do that when listening in a noisy environment such as on the street.  They do not cancel out noise very well. I have tried different ear bud tips and none seem to seal well enough to block out the noise. The microphone is not very good either. The person on the other end of the call thought I had my hand over the microphone. They could hear me, but barely.  I called Samsung and explained what I was experiencing and they said I got a defective pair and that I should call Amazon and ask for a replacement pair sent out.  That pair is on the way.  I hope all of the issues mentioned above will be resolved with the new pair.  We shall see.  I will update this review once I get the new pair and try them for a spell.  If things do not change, they will go back to Amazon for a refund.  I will go back to my $50 pair that sound better, do not cut out as frequently, and make better calls.  The only drawback to them over the Samsung is the battery life is shorter, about half as long. 5/24 Update:  The replacement pair had fewer problems. but still cut out when playing music, so they were returned and I get a refund.  I will go back to my $50 Ikanzis and I have ordered another pair so I can have longer listening time. When one pair needs to be charged, I will simply use the other pair.  Even though I bought two pair, their total cost is less than one pair of Samsungs.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only thing I really dislike is that all the customizable options are only available through the Samsung wearable app and while the buds work perfectly with my iPad and laptop like any other Bluetooth headphones, I really do wish I could use the ambient mode and equalizer as well. Otherwise, if you don’t care about these settings, it has been a very solid purchase. Battery is very very good, and, though not officially noise cancelling, they do nest in your ears in a way that it feels like noise cancelling as only really loud sound gets through. Ambient noise, doesn’t. Though, when walking with them, you do listen and feel the steps, and it takes time to adjust. Same goes with the buds overall.

The problem is that they constantly cut in and out while playing music.  Sometimes it is one side, sometimes the other.  Happens sometimes if I just turn my head.  If I take the phone out of my pocket and hold it near my head, they seem to be fine - so seem like some sort of low blue tooth power issue?  Can't say what the issue is for sure, but I  see MANY folks are having the same issue.

The second issue I have is that tapping the ear buds for the functions isn't realiable.  sometimes I have to tap multiple times just to get a single tap to register.

On the plus side they are extremely comfortable to wear, cut out background noise including windy conditions.  BUT because of the cutting out issue, they are unusable.

I keep hoping, given all of the complaints, that samsung would have fixed this in one of the several updates they have rolled out - but no such luck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had to install an app on my Pixel 3 XL, which then prompted me to install another plugin (could be better). Still, this took overall just about a minute.

The audio quality is great, although turning off ambient noise made it considerably worse. I don't know why that is, but leaving ambient noise on and setting its volume to zero left me with great sound.

The reason why I'm giving the Buds 2 stars, and why I'll ultimately return them, is the quality of the microphone. I simply cannot use them for calls, either on my Pixel 3 XL (regular phone call or Skype) or on my Surface Book (and Skype). While I have no problem hearing the other person, they can barely hear me. This is not an issue with the signal quality, as I don't have the problem with AirPods or via USB-C headphones with microphone.

I don't have huge demands on the microphones: it's obvious that one shouldn't use them to record a podcast. But having a conversation on a call is not a cutting edge feature and I'm completely perplexed why the microphone is so poor that this is not feasible. I initially thought I might just have a defect pair of Buds, but googling the issue specifically returned a number of reviews raising the same issue.

It's really a shame: they are otherwise well worth the money. But making calls isn't exactly a fringe use of headphones like these...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bought many different types of headphones, headsets, in-ear, over-ear, bluetooth, etc. I've always struggled to find something that would stay in my ears while I worked out. I had never had headphones that could accomplish this, at some point the sweat and motion would gradually make the headphone in my ear loose.

I bought these with the intention of returning them if they fell out while I ran. They did not. I was also surprised by the quality of the sound -- sometimes they do go in and out depending on phone distance and whether something's blocking it.

The call quality is also good -- my wife had immediate surprise when I talked to her on the phone with them as it seemed extremely clear on the other side.

I'd highly recommend buying these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The battery life is phenomenal, and they often last me nearly the entire duration of my 8 hour work shift. They're also very convenient to charge in the case, and they charge quickly, so you can get right back to listening. They fit comfortably (the wings took a few days to get used to. They used to hurt my ears a little bit, but now that I've grown accustomed, I don't notice it at all), and I've never worried that they'll fall out when I have the wings on.

My one complaint. Phone calls. When talking with people, I've had lots of complaints about me sounding pretty quiet and the background noise being really loud. If you're outside while on the phone, the mic picks up even the slightest breeze. It can make it pretty dofficult to communicate. It's not so bad if you're in a room without any background noise, but if you're in public or outside at all, it becomes a problem.

These things are awesome. And the bass is deep too and the sound is clear. Perfect for heavy metal! The battery life is awesome, the touchpad is the thing I need to get used to but so far. These things already got me happy. And I can't hear my surroundings. That's awesome too, unless someone needs my attention, that is.

I have tried many bluetooth earbuds, both wired and true wireless, and these take the cake. I guess what surprised me the most is that these earbuds are unsurprising? They do everything they say they will do, and they do it fairly well.

Sound quality: Good, completely satisfactory, but not amazing. Which is fine considering their size and weight. Pretty flat frequency response, but the bass can be nice and punchy if you get it fitted right.

Battery life: Excellent, never had a problem or even come close to draining the battery. But like I said, my longest typical use is a 1 hour workout. Wireless charging is excellent, but not insanely snappy. Perfect for tossing your earbuds on your desk when you go to bed and picking them up in the morning.

Fit: Amazing. Never even comes close to coming out, better than any other headphones I've ever used, wired or not! Very comfortable and light, never caused me any problems, even during heavy running.

My personal favorite category, VIDEO PLAYBACK. I have hated every true wireless earbud I've tried because of awful latency between the video playback and the audio. These earbuds have practically no noticeable latency! It's awesome. However, I have been told that non-Samsung devices tend to have mixed results with this.

Durability: So far, so good! I have sweated thoroughly with these on, and dropped them a good couple times (the case too) and they seem to be fine. If you drop them, there is a 90% chance that the lid will open and the earbuds will fly out, but this doesn't seem to cause too much damage.

And the rub, software: Not great. Yet. It works, but I have encountered an irritating issue. Like many earbuds, these have a volume level separate from your phone's volume. This can only be easily changed if you set the touchpads on each earbud to adjust their volume. Which means you cant use the touchpads for other things like the ambient sound mode or to summon your voice assistant. Software could definitely be better.

If you have any sound quality issues, my suggestion is to play around with the phone and headset volumes. I personally crank up the earbuds all the way, then adjust listening volume with the phone.

All in all, these have satisfied a very picky person who hated all the other true wireless earbuds he tried.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the Samsung Galaxy Buds, I can finally listen to music with zero wind noise when I'm outside. My music sounds incredible, and the app has plenty of options for adjusting the sound. They fit securely in my ears, regardless of how active I am. Noise cancellation is fantastic. Wireless charging is so convenient. HOWEVER, I have a Samsung Galaxy S10 phone, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds are useless for voice calls. I can hear fine, but every person I've been on a call with has said my voice is garbled - regardless of whether I'm in a quiet room or in my car.

 - Great fit.  They fit nice and snug and don't feel at all like they want to come loose.  I've had many other nice (wired) earbuds, and some that come with different ear hole cups.  None have been large enough to fit snug.  The large size cups and rings on the Galaxy buds fit perfect.
- Sound quality is good.  Not great, but good.
- The charging case is nice and works well.
- Battery life seems good.
- Bluetooth performance is poor, and I'm talking about range, not sound.  I have an S9, and this phone works great with my gear wearable and my car stereo via bluetooth.  I normally have my phone in my back pocket, and the buds do not work well at all with it there.  In my front pocket its better, but if I turn my torso at all in either direction, the sound cuts out and gets choppy right away.  These two factors alone are enough for me to wish I hadn't spent the money on these.  I should have waited another year for version 2.  The phone simply needs to be too close to the buds for them to work well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So comfort and fit a solid 10! These fit and feel perfect! I can watch movies for hours and experience no ear fatigue. The Bose fit nice and are comfortable but unfortunately look ridiculous on your ears. I still think airpods look worse however the Bose are comfortable. Next Jabra's are nice however I did experience ear fatigue even with the smallest earpiece. Raycons looked and felt great however I could not get them to connect so they suck! Next the tranya T3 are a solid 9 on comfort and style. Now sound here the buds get a 8 from me. Bose are a 10, Jabra's get a 9 and Tranya T3 are at a 7 because the Bass is amazing! However the sound as not as clear at Samsungs buds. Battery life is also a plus. Today as I write this review I lost my left earbud for about 10 minutes! I had no idea where it was however with the find my buds app I was able to find it on the floor near my chair! I was so happy I was able to find it before leaving work. I hope this review helps. Remember these sound great and are the smallest and most comfortable earbuds currently on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Phone disk space all over again. The sound is meh. The highs are VERY bright while the medium & bass are almost non-existent.

Pros:
Touch is cool
Wireless charging is awesome and works with my Note 10's powershare

Cons:
Price - Is very expensive (expect massive price drops in the coming years as technology becomes mainstream)
Battery life - Will be on timed releases for the next decade
Sound - Very Bright (equalizer does nothing) i.e. no bass
Not compatible with aftermarket foam tips as they won't fit in the case if you add them

If you absolutely need to have these great! But be aware you will be tempted to upgrade every year as they time release the battery life. Also the sound is VERY VERY lacking. I returned and got a cheaper alternative that sounds better and was $80 cheaper.

If you are looking for an alternative consider getting TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fit: Decent, At first my ears somewhat hurt at the end of the day. However that went away pretty quickly and I was wearing them for a very long time. They fit well enough to run around and not have to worry about them coming out, there are also different sizes included in the package.

Controls: Good, these can be updated by Samsung so they can get better if needed. However currently (June 16 2019) they are pretty good. Different amounts of taps do different things, holding down can do whatever you select off of the Galaxy Buds app such as ambient sound.

Battery life: Amazing, I doubt you will hear the low battery tone very often. I still can't remember what it sounds like.

I've always had an issue with earbuds being able to stay in my ears, and these do very nicely, even providing several different size tips to swap out.

On sound quality, these have perhaps have one of the best that I've heard, even provided with an equalizer via the app. I like that I can change the touch pad via the app to use as a volume control. If there was one drawback, it's that the touch pad is not customizable enough.

The size is just right in that they are small enough to not be too noticeable  and to stay in comfortably. I use these at work while programming and I've used these while mowing the lawn. They keep the sounds out with the excellent noise cancellation.

I've listened to these for an entire 8 hour work day, stuck them in the charging case and then was able to get an additional time out of them when I got home.  Long battery life is another excellent feature of these. They also pair well with just about any device with Bluetooth. I've paired them to two different PCs and my Android phone.

If you are looking for an excellent, affordable pair of truly wireless earbuds, I highly recommend these.

I happened to get these galaxy buds as a promotion for s10 phone, otherwise I'd probably would have waited. Anyways, super excited about recieving the most expensive headphones I'd ever own. Finally got them a few days ago, and I gotta say, kinda underwhelmed.

I like the fit, the weight, and design, they seem to fit very snug for workouts and running. They case is sleek, charges the battery, all the good stuff you'd expect from a $100 plus headphones. My problem with the buds is the sound quality... I mean, it's not bad, but its got great either. I expect good, but these are... ok.
Beside that the ambient noise feature seems tinny, not sure how its supposed to sound, but the noise is so distorted I usually got to take them out to clearly hear anything. Still i guess you can hear cars honk at you or other loud noises, but it's not a feature i see myself using very much.

Other than that not too much connection issues, easy to pair, pretty to look at, super awesome when they come for free. If I were to pay for them, I'd say about $75 to $90, higher than usual only because of the samsung namebrand. Lotta flash, some substance.

If you're looking for decent wireless earbuds the $55 jlabs actually sound great, they come with earbud fins that make all the difference, the sound is lush (for $55), hardly any connection issues.

The noise cancellation is weak. I'm not a sound snob though, so I probably would have kept these buds had they been more comfortable.

I have small ears, and they were simply too big. After a while, my ears would ache from the pressure on the upper section of my ear (where the soft piece sits). I tried both the hook and non-hook style, and both hurt.

The final kicker was the first time I used these I took my dog for a walk. Mind you, it was not a run, so no real bouncing. At one point, I jogged to cross a street, and my left bud fell out. I noticed within a block, retraced my steps, and found it, but that should never happen. I can't afford to lose a $160 pair of buds. These are supposed to stay put, and they didn't in my ears. I can't even imagine running with them.

I sent them back. These were not a win for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I wanted to give the Galaxy Buds a shot because they cost half as much at retail and feature two other features that the Pro's do not. (Small charging case and wireless charging.)

I should say from the start that I have been using the Beats Powerbeats3's for 15 months now so I'm not going to really accept anything that doesn't sound as good if not better than those headphones. Sadly, the Galaxy Buds to my ears cannot compete with Powerbeats3's, however I do enjoy their sound greater than the AirPods which I briefly owned.

Pros

* Sound better than AirPods to my ears.
* Tiny charging case is easy to carry in your front pocket.
* 3 different silicone tips and wings means you will find the right fit and feature excellent noise isolation.
* Wireless charging. (This is awesome!!!)
* USB-C (Better than MicroUSB)
* Easy to update the software without Galaxy Wearable App. (Need to have a PC though.)
* Very small profile and don't stick out of your ears. Very comfortable!
* Excellent consistent bluetooth connection.
* Excellent touch controls. (Make sure you update the software before using the first time.)

Cons

* No iOS Galaxy Wearable App means you lose out on A LOT. (Ambient mode, EQ settings, Find My Buds, and most importantly, the ability to change touch controls to 'volume with a long press'. (Why didn't Samsung just make this the default action instead of a personal assistant???)
* Sound quality is very good but not great IMO. Certainly not on the level of my Powerbeats3's. Did my best to play with different EQ's in the iOS Music app but nothing could hide the weaknesses. Probably just fine for the price and truly wireless at this point but don't expect amazing IMO.

If you are debating between this and the AirPods, I would seriously consider the Galaxy Buds, even if you have an iPhone. Now I can't say if the mics will be just as good as the AirPods for phone calls. But that aside, I'm confident the sound and fit of the Galaxy Buds are superior to AirPods. They weren't good enough for me but I think they are an excellent choice for many others. And compared to the new AirPods with the wireless charging case, they are $70 less at retail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_218?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=218&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a few hours of comparisons and a full workout in each, I am sticking with the galaxy buds. The sound quality is better, more clarity and depth, but a little less bass. The ambient noise feature is unique, but nice and I'll have to play around with it. These were much more comfortable for longer wear than the jlabs. Both stayed in place well, but these do not stick out as much. That made them feel more secure and I touched them less. The touch pad is intuitive, but sensitive. I stopped my music a few times on accident. I pair these with a galaxy s8, and the galaxy wear app provides additional controls and EQ settings that are nice. Glad I spent a little extra to try them. However, the jlab air buds are a quality product, especially if you don't own a Samsung phone. Attached photos show relative size difference between the galaxy buds and jlab air buds.

These fit exceptionally well right out of the box. They do not take a lot of finagling or cramming into the ear canal. I simply popped them in, gave them a slight twist and they are secured. I have had numerous very sweaty and intense workouts and they don't fall out. From time to time, they may get a little loose, but I simply readjust and they stay put for hours again. I am extremely impressed by the comfort of these as well. They only con is that they aren't very good at noise cancellation. Otherwise, these were a great investment and I would definitely recommend. Also, voice quality during telephone calls I am told is decent.

If not for the fit issues, I would have rated this a 5.  But the fit of the buds in my ear are a big factor and a disappointment.  Other than that, everything else is ok.  I am just dissatisfied with the fit.  After seeing family members with the Apple Airpods, I was considering purchasing those (before buds came out). Although I wouldn't get the full benefit of the Airpods being that I own an Android Samsung device, they looked to be a good option for hands-free.  I was excited when Samsung came out with the Galaxy Buds for their devices.  I could now have something similar to Airpods to cater to the device I own. But I became disappointed when I realized the buds do not fit comfortably in my ear. I have tried all 3 of the supplied eartips/wingtips.  I can be walking and one would fall out of my ear.  I have to be careful how I move about because they are just not secure. I am hesitant in using them when working out for fear of losing one. Even now, sitting at my desk at work, they feel as though they are about to fall out.  I wanted to love them so bad but it just hasn't worked out for me. Sadly

Updated comment: They did fall out my ear while I was sitting at my desk. Annoying and aggravating. Especially to have paid for something. I hate I waited until return period had expired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried some Yurbuds, and they stayed in ok but still needed occasional adjustments...and wires annoy me.  I have Jaybird X4's which I absolutely love - they sound amazing AND stay in...but they block out so much ambient sound that they feel unsafe to use, which helped me decide that I needed something truly wireless so I could use it in only one ear and still hear traffic approaching when I run.  So I tried some $50 airpod-ish knockoffs, which worked but fell out of my ears constantly.  Then I tried some Plantronics Backbeat Fit 3100s, and they worked great for talking on the phone, and they stayed in my ears, but music sounded terrible - like I was listening to it through a few paper towels (and I'm not that picky!)...I had to return them.  So then I tried these Samsung Buds, and I am impressed.  I just took them for a long run, and after an hour of a fairly intense workout, I did not need to adjust them a single time.

I have shelled out collectively close to $1,000 and tried all the major brands. While my overall experience has been pretty positive, my individual experience with each has been a combination of highs and lows. That is until I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds. On paper, the features for these things looked pretty amazing - 6 hour playtime with an additional 7 hours stored in the case, wireless charging, automatic pairing when the case is opened, touch controls, I mean, what's not to like? Then I actually put them in my ears and started my workout. This was going to be the real test. When using earbuds, the single most important feature is the fit, because if the bud doesn't conform to your ear properly and create a tight seal, the sound will be washed and the base nonexistent. The way the buds came out of the package did not form that seal for me, but the additional tips and ear stabilizers gave me more options. After switching out the stock setup, I was pleased to find that I was able to achieve that seal, and let me tell you, the sound is impressive. I'm fairly certain the base was the best I've experienced of any buds I've owned. As far as my workout went, the Galaxy Buds didn't move a millimeter. Not when I was rowing, not when I was deadlifting, and not when I was slamming battle ropes. I can't honestly say I've successfully put any other bud through my workout routine without getting at least some movement, which ultimately broke the seal and ruined the sound. I think the Galaxy Buds passed this test for two reasons. First, the stabilizers keep the outer part of the bud firmly in place, and don't allow any space for them to move. Second, the bud itself is almost flush with the ear, so there isn't much projecting outward to create the leverage needed for wobble. Another awesome feature is the ambient sound option. When ambient sound is turned on, you can actually hear the outside world in addition to your music. It's actually quite mind boggling when you use it. I'm assuming it uses the mic that picks up your voice during phone calls to receive external sound and pipe it through the buds with your music. I'm so happy with the performance of the Samsung Galaxy Buds that I keep an additional pair charged in my car to wear when I work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I liked instruction from Gear X and they had internal memmory but they were big, uncomfortable but they had bigger touch platform and you can always min/max volume on them. With Galaxy buds, that is not imposible but the best things is that they correct mistakes from Gear Ivan X 2018. The sound is very good, some of higher voices are much clear and for 30% smaller buds before, they are perfect! If You are talking with someone on Facebook, and after that You want to play a music, quality of the songs will drop to 35%. My advice after that is to CLOSE multitasking (where is opened messenger or facebook). If this not help, you need to restart the device. Whats Up, Viber, and Line don't have this problems.

Then I got them replaced through amazon and used those for about a week until I decided to update them and see if they would work after updating, thinking that it was only a problem with the other pair. After the update I tested them and they did the same thing that the first pair did. Bottom line is that these are good earbuds, but something with the update makes these $130 earbuds turn into something that has the same problems as $1 earbuds.

When I received my Buds, they were completely dead and I was kind of bummed out I could not pop them in immediately. I don't know if they all come like this, but it was not really a big deal as they were charged up and ready to go in about 20-30 minutes! After charging them I put them in and was immediately blown away by the fit, sound and overall ease of use. Before receiving my Buds I was concerned about the fit, but these things stay in like no other earbud I have ever used and I assume that with the interchangeable fins and tips the fit will be perfect for everyone! My initial reaction to the sound was ok I guess, but after using them for a month with different genres of music I am a very happy customer! The highs are crisp and the lows are low, I changed the EQ a few times but found that dynamic sound mode to be the best overall for all types of music. The Buds are great for work, play, sport or any situation, I use them when I mountain bike, while mowing, at work and in the car! The only negative which really is not bad, is the ambient sound mode. While it works as advertised, if you have your music turned up you will still have to pause your music to conversate. However even at the loudest music volume you can hear things around you which is the point I suppose. Overall I am super happy with the Galaxy buds and their performance in all the situations I have used them, I would and have told many people they need some buds in their life immediately!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Only negative is you can only use them with one device at a time. Which is not a huge problem for me.

I really really want to like them, but at the end of the day the only pros are: great battery life, and they're truly wireless.

You can read in other reviews about a lot of their shortcomings, mostly all that are just nitpicky, but these really do have some MAJOR flaws:
-When walking around outside the connection quality is terrible most of the time. It breaks up and the buds get out of sync every step or two.
-Call quality is so bad that people always ask me to stop using them so they can hear me
-The most recent software update essentially destroyed my pair. They don't connect correctly anymore, and they have to send me a replacement (Samsungs customer service has been terrible. Best case scenario the replacement will arrive in 3 weeks). I've read online about a lot of people having the same issue and having to get replacements.

If they were $40 I'd say these are worth it to get over the problems, but $130+ is outrageous.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_272?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=272&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros
 - very discreet earbuds. I like how they don't stick out of your ears like the Air Pods for example.

- If you have a Samsung phone, there is an App where you can adjust the sound profile. Though I personally didn't hear a huge difference, you can also adjust the ambient noise where it allows you to hear the environment around you. This was a huge plus for me, and it works very well.

- the travel case is small, and discreet as well. Doesn't leave a big buldge in your pocket or anything. I never found myself running out of battery on my earbuds on any day. I can wear my earbuds up to 3 hours at a time at %30-50 volume.

- sound quality is above average. at this price point, I didn't have Godly like expectations where I would be getting Sennheiser True Wireless like sound stage. Those earbuds cost more than double, so let's be realistic here people.

-you CAN wear one earbud at a time if you would like, regardless if it's the left or right earbud. Doesn't matter. I didn't realize how much this mattered to me until I used it for a longer period of time. In comparison, the Jabra Elite can only wear one earbud if it's the RIGHT earbud. The left cannot play music alone. That was a huge deal breaker for me, as for you.. you can decide if that matters. When you take out the earbud when wearing both, music does not pause on the other one you're wearing it and vice versa. When you're just wearing one earbud and decide to put in the second one, music continues playing and it's a smooth transition.

- can be charged wirelessly, on a s10/s10+. I didn't use this feature much, but it's cool knowing they it's there. It charges much slower on your phone vs a direct wired connection

Cons:

- this is not a deal breaker for me, but it may be for you. It's not water resistant. I think it can only take an x amount of sweat, but you don't wanna get these drenched in water. These are not advertised as workout headphones so I'm personally completely fine with it. I have a separate earbuds for that scenario.

-though the case is small, everytime I dropped it my earbuds always fly out of the case. I wish it didn't open that easily with drops. So don't drop your earbuds in the case

- to my surprise, I haven't used it much for phone calls. But from what I heard from other YouTube reviewers, they say call quality is terrible in noisy environments. Callers have a hard time hearing you, so try to be in a quiet environment if possible.

- the earbuds have gestures to pause/skip tracks, answer and ignore calls. I used mine primarily for music. one thing I noticed, which might POSSIBLY be a user error on my end.. but every now and then the Buds don't register my touches. Example. When I double tap to skip track, sometimes it registers only 1 tap and the song pauses. Minor annoyance, but something to be aware of. I think you have to hit the earbuds perfectly rather than just the edge of your finger. another thing I noticed is if you're listening to music and you skip a few tracks on your music Playlist, each time you hit double tap I feel like the earbuds are getting pushed deeper and deeper into my ear canal, and it's discomforting. I wish in the future maybe they do a swipe feature as a gesture to skip and go back to a track rather than the double/triple tap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I figured I'd take the opportunity and ""upgrade"" to these while I'm at it.

Oh boy was I wrong... The only positive about these were 2 things: 1) can be wirelessly charged, and 2) when notifications come up, the buds tell you what app the notification is coming from.

Everything else is worse. But most importantly... hot damn is the connection terrible. You'd think that upgrade bluetooth version, it'd have better connectivity but NOPE. I can't be like 2 meters away from the bluetooth source or the music starts getting all choppy. In the case of my PS Vita, I can't even go half a meter away! Where my IconX worked PERFECTLY fine.

People tell me that they can't hear me, and it only works well when I'm indoor and it's very quiet.

Another issue that happens mostly in Whatsapp Calls and Voice Conference apps (Zoom, WebEx etc) is that the earpieces are not in sync, so you hear 'double', and I haven't seem to be able to work around this issue so far with any device I've used. For some reason when playing music this does not happen.

I also had the Sony WI-1000X, which was my daily driver for over a year now; so the pro and con is more of comparison with the Sony than with anything else.

Pros:
Price
Battery
Size
Light weight
Big name Brand
Good battery connection with the case.

Cons:
The buds randomly lose sync even with the latest firmware.
The buds will lose connection when covered up. (wanted to listen to music with a headphone; while listening audio book with the buds. The left side buds works but the right side always gives out)
The volume gets higher if you have both of them on, but as soon as you take the right buds out, it drops?!
And the overall volume is low, about mid range versus other headphone or earbuds.
The Sony WI-1000X have ANC, but with only 2 hours of battery. The galaxy bud have no ANC but the battery is 3X more. And the Galaxy buds is also almost 1/3 of it's price.

I am very familiar with Samsung products, and was excited about these after reading the upgrades over previous versions.

Pros:
Compact, lightweight, very comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. I even wear them while running and they do not move.
Sound quality is good. Noise canceling is decent considering that it is only passive. I spend a lot of time on planes and they work well I blocking background noises.

Cons:
Battery life and charging. Will only get about 3 hours of continuous use. A pain if you spend long periods of time on a plane. Also, charging is inconsistent across the buds. I have had the left bud not charge at all several times.

My biggest issue with these buds has been call quality. They are absolutely horrendous!  The microphone muffled your voice, all the while picking up every little sound around you. I have found improved performance indoors, but absolutely useless outdoors and in noisy environments like airports. Totally defeats the purpose of why I bough them for.

If you are looking for good buds for listening to your favorite tunes, then these are a good choice. If you’re like me and are also needing to use them for calls, I do not recommend them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The mic is also garbage, something I was embarrassed to discover while attempting to conduct a business call. I've attempted all of the recommended troubleshooting techniques and it's never improved.

According to what I have been able to find you would have to be using Windows 8 or an earlier version to have compatibility with the Galaxy Ear Buds via your PC Bluetooth connection.

Let’s start with the fact there is no compatibility to a PC via Bluetooth. Regardless if your PC is Bluetooth ready, these may may not pair. They didn’t work with my brand new Dell Latitude 5290 running Windows 10. Hence, if you travel with a laptop or use it to listen to music while working you may be plain out of luck.
Second issue is if you want to use these with an IPhone you may want to reconsider this. I did get sound from them and they did pair. However, there is no supporting app I’m in the apple App Store which means you can’t update firmware unless you go to a store and have them do it. That was Samsung’s work around for this issue. Also all you can do is listen and talk without any of the so called features.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main thing is these don't stay in my ears at all, no matter which fins and inserts I use. Next, the fact that you can't customize all of the touch gestures is extremely annoying. These two problems led to me trying to push them further into my ear and constantly pausing my music.  I don't have good luck with these type of earbuds fitting properly. I need to use over the ear headphones apparently, I'll try airpods but I'm not holding out too much hope.

Battery life is not great compared to cheaper options I've tried either.

Also, if you are buying these for the ambient sound feature like I did, then maybe keep looking. It didn't work for me at all. Even with voice focus, it only picked up the loudest noises (dropping weights, and gym screamers). My wife who was 3 feet in front of me talking was muted by my music, so any conversation with someone who spoke quietly or had a higher voice was imperceptible unless I was violating their personal space.

I love that they charge with Qi or USB-C. The case is very nice and I don't notice it too much in my pocket.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
1. Excellent sound(for stereo), for ear-pods. I mostly listen to rock and metal, quite satisfied with the sound, the bass mostly.
2. Battery lasts long enough without using the cradle. about 5+ hours at full volume without recharge.
3. Cradle is small enough for carrying in your pocket, about the same volume as Apple airpods.
4. They don't have noise canceling, but the tight seal they form while wearing them seem like they do. Just turn the volume up and you're good to go.

Cons(all of these have pretty simple solutions):
1. Battery doesn't last long enough, would trade a slightly bigger cradle for more than 7 hours of extra battery. (just being picky).
2. The low volume default setting was off-putting at first but managed to solved it.
3. Cradle material feels slightly fragile and cheap, as if i drop them a couple of times, it will crack.

I own QC35, QC20, MDR7506. Tested WH1000XM3, QC35 II. For being a quite small piece of electronic, they do pack a punch. just enough for my taste. Since i like to travel light, they will perfectly substitute my QC20s (hate the wires and the big noise canceling brick) for now.

EDIT 1: A Month In: Work great still, battery lasts as long as its intended. BUT, it bugs me when they are connected to my galaxy S9+ and i open my pc and the connection changes to my pc. I open the blutooth settings, manually disconect the earbuds from the pc and manually conect them to my phone again. WITHIN SECONDS they reconect to my pc again...rinse and repeat till im fed up and have to remove them entirely from my pc. Turning off the pc bluetooth is not an option since i have other devices conected to it. Happens when im in the car too, i start the radio and they instantly disconnect from my phone. Setting the car radio to audio only doesnt seem to fix it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No ear fatigue what so ever and comes with 3 sets of tips for the best possible fit. For something this small, I didn't expect the sound quality to be that great, however its the opposite. Audio quality is one of the best in its category and features a built in equalizer to customization. I can hear the highs and lows very well even when on a call in a noisy environment. Wireless charging case is a great added feature even a quick 10 mins of charging gives me about 40 mins of musics. If you have a Samsung Galaxy S10 variants, you can use the PowerShare feature to charge the case. Love the Find My Earbuds feature which send out an audible sound to direct you to it location(they do want you to find them). Ambient sound to hear your surrounding.

Airpods don't fit in my ears so I needed an alternative. I read that Galaxy buds will work with an iPhone, although you will miss out on some features like Ambient Noise mode, but I was fine with that. I also own a Pixel for work so I knew I could always update the Galaxy buds using that phone.

In general, the headphones are fine. No connectivity issues, they fit well, everything seems to be in working order. Connected to my Pixel, listened to some music, played around with the equalizer in the galaxy bud app, the sound was good for wireless earbuds. Then I connect to my iPhone and start listening to Spotify. The sound was awful. Super loud, tinny  treble, a constant static-y sound in the background, awful sound mixing, overall way too quiet even at max volume. I tried playing around with the equalizer in Spotify and that improved things a bit, but it was still far worse than when listening on an Android device, even without and changes to the equalizer. Obviously whatever audio drivers are installed on the headphones don't work with apple products. I will be returning these if I can.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have only charged them two times since I got them.

I did encounter one flaw.. one day after being in a hot car when I popped them in my ears I heard a slight buzz. I turned them off and heard it again after going back on.

They are very comfortable, the sound is good once you use the right settings, and the battery life is great.

One thing I want to say is that I honestly believe many of the complaints about poor volume and Bass are due to operator error by not using the right settings on your phone. Low volume is easily fixed by enabling ""media volume sync"" on your phone. As for the bass, I use the Samsung music app. Once I enabled the Dolby Atmos feature it gave my music much richer sound and deeper bass. So the pro tip is use the equalizer on your phone not the buds. Also using the right sized rubber bud fittings is key to good sound. If these aren't in your ear enough just push them in a bit, the difference in sound quality is huge.

One complaint I do have is the ambient noise feature. It amplifies everything a little too much. A light breeze that would normally not be noticeable will sound like constant wind whistling in your ears with the ambient noise feature on. Its very annoying so I leave it disabled.

Other than that these are great buds. I strongly recommend them for Samsung Galaxy phone owners. I have had ZERO connectivity or dropped connection issues that others reported with non Galaxy phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have used them several times over the past week. When they work they are nice, they work fine if I use them at work or around the house, but if I'm running or hiking they de-sync from each other and stutter CONSTANTLY. They are completely unusable and infuriating. They have been updated by Samsung, but still the connection problems persist. Hopefully Samsung can fix these problems in the future, but until then I'm not happy about paying top shelf prices for a beta test. I'm going back to my $20 Chinese earbuds that actually WORK.

I received my Galaxy Buds last Friday the 29th. I was excited to receive them as  I use earbuds often when working out or just walking around and the $20 set of Chinese earbuds I had been using worked reasonably well but I wanted to splurge a little on some really nice truly wireless earbuds.

Initial thoughts:

Aesthetically they are very nice, they don't hang out of your ears, really it just looks like you are wearing earplugs or something. They fit comfortably in the ears, they come with a variety of rubber parts of various sizes so you can really dial in the fit. Most importantly they sort of ""lock in"" to your ears. That is a feature that I cannot live without. There's nothing I hate more than earbuds falling out when you are just getting into a run.

I used them around the house over the weekend. Buds in, phone sitting on my desk or sometimes in my pocket and they worked fine. The sound is decent. I'm no audiophile but I've used good earbuds and bad ones and these definitely fall into the good category. The app is great, the charging case is convenient and easy to use, and the ambient sound ""enhancement"" works surprisingly well.

Now for the downside:

I took the Buds out for a little hike today, nothing serious. Phone in my pocket. At first they worked fine, but as the hike went on they started cutting out intermittently. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, sometimes they were out of sync with each other. I tried disconnecting them, turning bluetooth on and off, even messing with audio settings. I tried holding the phone, putting it in a different pocket, no matter what I tried it would only help the problem for a few seconds at most. By the time I was nearing the end of the trail the earbuds were almost unusable cutting out and stuttering constantly.

I had a similar problem with a pair of the Chinese bluetooth earbuds and I had to return them for a replacement, but now the current pair I have work flawlessly. I'll try the Galaxy Buds again and update my review, but if this continues and the connectivity is really worse than a $20 pair of earbuds I can't recommend these to anyone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately the audio dropped out constantly during my commute walking in a major city. This happened even after updating the software. Any time I put my phone in my pocket and simply wanted to walk with music playing (including tracks that were downloaded to my device) the audio was choppy and cut out constantly. This rendered them useless and so I had to return them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Wireless-charging-included/product-reviews/B07MWCNR3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Both buds would randomly cut out in the middle of a song and would continue for about 2 minutes until I turned off the buds and reconnected them. I also have a galaxy watch, so I wonder if the simultaneous connection of my phone to my buds and watch may have caused the bad connection. The buds themselves also could've been faulty. Either way I just returned them because it was too big of a problem too soon after I bought them. Otherwise comfort and sound were great.
