"Sounds great, but low battery life","They really do sound good, but the battery life of the charger is low. I travel a lot of work, and I use them at the gym so this is somewhat problematic. I have to remember to charge them when I get home even after moderate use or they are dead when I go to the gym.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfortable & great sounding earbuds,"Really like my new earbuds.  They are comfortable and fit well with the ability to swap out the rubber ear piece to get the best fit.  My music sounds great with a nice balance of low, mids and highs.  So far, talking on the phone has been clear.  The callers on the other end can hear me good and clear too.  The charging case is a nice feature as well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are the best earbuds for music!!!,I am soooo pleased with these earbuds!  I’ve tried others and had to return them.  Pairing of others was a challenging task.  These paired effortlessly!  The sound quality was so pleasantly surprising.  I followed the instructions to find the best fitting cushion.  The fit is perfect.  I’m hoping battery life won’t be a problem.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound Quality and Waterproof In Steam Room,"Love these earbuds, needed them to use in a steam room and they work fabulously.  Sound quality is great, bass is amazing.  Only issue I had is that it disconnected from my far below the the 32 feet, or 10 Meters, it claimed.  Also, if I wore only 1, earbud, the music would skip/or fade in and out.  I did buy them for the steam room and they work wonderfully.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent Quality, Sound, and battery life","These earbuds are excellent! They have some of the best sound quality I've heard in addition to a great battery life. they are also very user-friendly and I have had no issues with their connectivity to each other or my phone. My one minor complaint would be that they do not automatically pair to my phone when they turn on. However I am willing to bear with this minor annoyance for the price. Overall, I would say these are some of the best wireless earbuds you can get for $50 and would highly recommend them to anyone interested in true wireless earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can't skip track or change volume. Range not great.,"Overall I like them. It's nice not to have to worry about getting them wet. When I have my phone in my cycling jersey pocket though I lose connection to the headphones occasionally which is pretty annoying. Some say you get a 30ft range, but inside a pocket with only my shoulders in the way it cuts out if I turn my head. I also wish I could do to the next track since I use them on a bike.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent but not for me.,"I truly wanted these to be the answer to my personal office music situation. First the good... These are very reasonably priced. The sound produced is better than expected for the price paid. The concept of a case that recharges it's earbuds multiple times without having to re-plug these into a recharging USB port is great. The recharging time is very fast when compared to the amount of time that you receive playing music. Now the bad... I had hoped to be able to plug the case into a wall outlet rather than a USB port for charging purposes. Not a deal breaker but it would have been nice. Next, the instructions that I received do not list all options; for example, how to turn off the earbuds. Not a deal breaker as I eventually figured this out on my own. Finally... these are extremely uncomfortable regardless which set of earcaps I used (S, M, L or XL). I had to use the small sized earcaps as none of the other sizes would stay in my ears. With the small earcaps, I was able to get them to stay as long as I sat at my desk and didn't make any sudden movements, but after about an hour, these earbuds became very uncomfortable. I need something that I can wear for 8 hours without discomfort. This was my deal breaker.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Company ""bribes"" for stars","Just an FYI, I returned these because the sound quality wasn't great and I had connectivity issues with it. However, it is worth noting that shortly after ordering, I started receiving emails asking me to review the product and I would receive a free charging disc at no cost to me.

I responded that I hadn't had the product long enough to warrant a true review and asked it a review was necessary to receive the product... no reply was given.

Just saying beware about the high number of stars, I don't think it's a legit reflection of opinions.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Almost perfect,"The product is great! The only thing that i can complain about is how it is hold in my ears. It is really not stable, and i have a felling all the time that it falls off...

Great value!,A very good value for the money. The wireless charging is a great update and it still has the micro usb charging port as well for travel. Sound quality is much better than expected. Good bass and noise reduction  is better than expected.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good product. Very good customer service,These earbuds have great sound and noise cancellation. The fit is very good and stay in my eats even during a workout. One earbud had a problem and the customer service was great and got me a replacement right away. Definitely recommend this product,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"I wanted to like these, but...","I really wanted to like these ear buds. Construction looks decent. Reviews were fairly positive and I don't like cords. I would however, not recommend these earbuds. While the sound is good in ideal conditions, they are marginal the rest of the time.

Fit--the rubber tips that came with the Tozo T10 are very uncomfortable. I had to use tips from another set of earbuds. And having tried 7 or 8 different set, I have to keep re-adjusting the earbuds.

Connectivity--they pair fairly easily, but the signal is weak. Because the right earbud is the master, I can not put my phone in my left pocket or they will not get a signal. They might be better than Bluetooth 4.2, but not by much. Sound fades out of the left side if I'm walking. And the sound is not consistent between the two side. Sitting at a desk or table with work fine.

Battery life--surprised how small the battery in the case is.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cordless Bliss for Smol Ears,"I was highly impressed with these Bluetooth earbuds as soon as I started using them!

I bought these because I have smaller ear canals that do not work with the AirPods or other non-silicone in-ear buds. I was skeptical about shelling out 50 bucks but the reviews convinced me on this pair and I’m super happy with my choice!

Pros:
- Incredible sound quality. Impeccable bass and treble / vocals sound super clear as well.
- Large range of volume. I usually have these set around 5 or 6, well below the max iPhone volume, and get almost no sound interference. They’re plenty loud with seemingly no loss of quality.
- EASY Bluetooth pairing! Once set up, they connect automatically in ~10 seconds to each other and my phone as soon as I take them out of their case.
- Sleek, magnetic charging case. I love the magnetized slots for the buds within the case and the fact that it holds about 4 charges.
- Comfortable, easy in-ear fit.

Cons:
- They are a taddddd bulky and look like they’re sticking out of my (relatively small) ears quite a bit. This is a negligible note since they’re still super comfy and the sound quality is GREAT!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Almost perfect,"These are wonderful. They cancel sound very well even without music, which I like because of the loud work environment Im in. When I bought them one of the ear buds would lose its charge in half of the time as the other one and I notified the company and was able to get a replacement very quickly. Wonderful customer service.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound!,I really like these ear buds. I was worried they would fall out of my ears. They come with several different sizes of ear tips. They fit great. Great noise cancelling. Its nice not to have a cord attached. I have two negatives or i would have given 5 stars. They pair automatically except i have to open my phone to tell it to pair. I dont have to do that with my car or my small blue tooth speaker.  As soon as i get in range they pair automatically.  The other is that it has to be in direct site to play. If i put my phone in my back pocket it cuts out.  These are very small compaired to the quality you get. These are the best blue tooth ear buds i have used.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Love these! Super easy to use and connects with all my devices,"Loving these headphones so far. The battery life is great and the headphones connect with all my devices. I previously had issues connect Bluetooth headphones to my computer but these easily connect and the sound quality is great. They are small and compact. I love the case, its all magnetic and the headphones has a designated space for each bud. Would recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Affordable quality product.,"I just got these today and I have to say that I'm impressed. The sound quality is very good for the price range. You can hear all the highs, mids, and feel the beat of the bass in your ear. Voices sound clear and undistorted. From out of the box and paired to my iPhone XS it took less than a minute. The battery only lasts 3 hours for music and 5 hours for talk so if that's important to you then you might want to consider other options. However with that being said the case can recharge the headphones up to 4 times before having to be recharged itself. The manual claims a 20-minute quick charge will get you 1 hour of life. They fit snugly in my ear without any discomfort and stay there just fine. There are different sized cushions for differently sized ear canals. Both the case and the headphones are waterproof. I've seen some people complain about these not working underwater. The manual clearly states with visuals that these will not work underwater as Bluetooth signal bounces off the surface of the water. If you were to ask me I'd say go ahead and buy them. Even if they aren't your main pair of true wireless earbuds then they'd make an excellent backup pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
2 pairs,Just bought an extra pair. They Re definitely beat headphones for the price. I like to wear them while I run and I sweat a lot. They are definitely water resistant.  I have broken beats and many other headphones that were supposed to be water resistant.  I would recommend these 100 percent.  I will never buy another brand,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Can't swim with them, but the sound quality is great.","These earbuds work awesome until you go under water with them, the only reason i give the 4 stars is ""waterproof"" to me means i should be able to swim with them on. Other than that these little earbuds with such a low price pack a nice punch and sound great, i will enjoy these for a long time.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really work - even in my ears,"I love the T10 earbuds. I have the kind of ears that will not hold Apple earbuds. They just fall out. I have not been able to find others that stay in my ears reliably, until I bought the T10s. I did 50 jumping jacks wearing the earbuds yesterday morning, and they stayed in place! Today, I gave them a more rigorous trial. I did a 30-minute P90X3 workout called CVX that involves lots of jumping up and down - lots of impact. The earbuds stayed in place the whole time - no problem! The sound is so good, that although I have done this workout at least 20 times in the past, this time, I heard parts of the commentary that I had never heard before. My previous earbuds had carrying cradles with hooks that went over the ears. They worked fine as long as there was not abrupt movement or bouncing. Then they would come loose and fall off. This even happened when I was on my rowing machine. The T10s, in contrast, are rock steady regardless of my movements. I also find that they pair easily with my iPhone, and my iPad, and my MacBook Air. And while I had trouble with my old earbuds when trying to switch from one device to another, the T10s are a breeze to switch between devices. I've only owned the T10s for 3 days, but so far, they seem to be an excellent product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic earbus,"I've owned a couple of sets of wireless earbuds like these, however, these surpass any of the others.  The sound quality is supurb; battery life is extremely long.  The wireless charging of the base is a unique feature and one that really drew me to this product as I have wireless charging pads all around my apartment and office, so to be able to just drop the base down on one and charge is a feature I'll never grow tired of.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Sound is AMAZING, range sucks :( VERY SAD :(","I ordered these to swim laps in a pool with, it says not for swimming. But it says you cant go underwater with em n use BT bc the water breaks up the signal.  No problem I dont ever get my head wet anyway. I tried these out n I was working on our 35'RV n it's good up to 10 meters(32'). It kept cutting out at about 28'-30' range. Cant even use a back yard pool with these.  Very sad as the sound is AMAZING! I LOVE EM, there comfy and many size plugs to fit any ear, but unless you have your device less than 20' away from you these will leave you frustrated. Everything is great with these buds expect the range. #sadpanda",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for price!,"I recently bought a pair of the Tozo t10 wireless earbuds , and could not be happier with the quality especially for the low price. I’ve been looking for a wireless earbud that is comfortable and cost effective, without sacrificing sound quality, so far Tozo has done exactly that. The sound is rich and full, they are comfortable to wear compared to other earbuds, and they connect very easily. For the price there is no better!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Horrible,"I wonder if the reviews here are for this item!  These earbuds are HUGE!  I received the earbuds yesterday.  I plugged in the charging box, to see that it is charging, you have to view from the top.  Once the box was charged I put in the earbuds to charge.  The light on the buds never turned from red to blue after hours of charging.  I use my earbuds to sleep so I removed them from the case and they paired with relative ease.  The sound was o.k. but there was a lot of fading in and out on the left side.  They would play for about a half hour and then nothing; once I turned them off and on they would play again.  For sleeping, these buds are ear splitting big and they did NOT come with different sized tips.  I am returning these post haste.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Product, Great Price! Highly Recommend!","I am very happy with my purchase of TOZO wireless earbuds! They are very comfortable and do not fall out even when working out. The sound quality is clear and loud. Even if I have the volume very low, the noise cancelling feature works great! I love these so much I got a pair for my dad too! We love them! Also, the battery pack can charge them 4x and you can put a string on the charger too so you can wear it on your neck if you have no pockets.

My only con is that the left earbud cannot connect without the right earbud being connected. But they're identical, so you can use the right one in the left ear if you want, so I still gave it 5 stars.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
a huge disappointment,"I decided to try these out as my first foray into single earbuds. I really wanted to like them and picked these for the extra features of the Qi charging, waterproof status and decent case.

It only took me a few days to realize this product was subpar. The sound was weak. I swapped out all the different ear bud pieces to find the right fit, nothing. My volume was maxed out on my phone (tried 3 different devices) to the same result. I normally am listening comfortably at 50% volume.

These also did nothing for canceling noise. At first I thought, ok, maybe I read the description wrong, maybe these ARE for hearing the ambient sound (not a bad feature in itself) but the features to rate this product includes a Noise Cancelletion option so this is clearly not the case.

On to the battery life. One word, horrid. I have previous wireless bluetooth headsets that do remarkably well, 5, 6 hours. The most disappointing and unacceptable part however was how it dies. I watch the % as I'm listening , 100%, 90%, 80%... After about an hour or more the sound degrades rapidly and if I check and see it at 60 or 50%, it starts to noise dive and drops to 40/30/20 and dead in less than 10 minutes. This simply sucks in my book and not going to work for any of my longer activities.

going back to the skull candy bluetooth, rock solid and better sound even after 1 year of use.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Amazing value, I just wished they worked with a Pixel 2","Right off the bat: I got a pair of these delivered, they would work for an hour or so and then I'd have major signal issues.  Left ear would cut out, right ear, the whole thing.  This ONLY occurs when I am moving and can sometimes be mitigated by not having my phone in my pocket.  That said,I worked with an Amazon rep to walk through a bunch of solutions and nothing worked.  They sent a replacement pair and I had the exact same problem.

All of that said, there is a very good chance that the problem is with my phone, a Pixel 2.  If you have a P2 or P2XL, you will remember that there were many issues at launch with Bluetooth connectivity.  I genuinely believe it is a compatibility issue.  I will say that I tried almost every configuration of settings I could (AVRCP versions, Bluetooth Audio Codecs, Sample rates, etc) and wasn't able to find any particular setup that would mitigate the problem. Also, I had a pair of BeatsX (that died prematurely, do NOT buy them) that never had any kind of signal issue like this.  I've also had other devices that worked great (fitness trackers, Bluetooth speakers) and did not have an issue with any of them.

So in short: the audio, battery life and usability of these earbuds is absolutely astonishing for $50.  If you have a device they will work with, I can't imagine a better value.  But as I said, they are all but useless to me at this point. Luckily the return process seems to be fantastic so I'm not out anything.  Also, I'm not seeing other folks have the problem so it is possible I got two bad pairs but I don't think so.  I just think it's a combination of issues around Pixel 2 Bluetooth, Android/Bluetooth versioning and the antenna setup on these particular earbuds.  Caveat Emptor if you have a Pixel 2.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great product at an unbeatable price.,"I did a lot of research before deciding on these ear buds. Many of the review videos I watched rated these better than the big name brand competitors.

"Great sound, good fit",I was skeptical to purchase these shape headphones because they are too large for my ears but these came with different size options. I can move my head around as much as I please and they stay in. They give great sound and a definitely noise canceling. The only complaint I have it that the microphone is not the strongest and it is hard for people to hear me when on the phone but that was something I expecting with the size of them. For the most part I love the headphone and I would 100% reccomend them for music and videos.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid Wireless Earbuds,"I love these earbuds! I have them on me constantly. They are incredibly easy to maneuver into a comfortable position from the case to your ear. Most of the time I do it with one hand.

The package comes with three sizes of ear buds that you can swap out to reach the ideal comfort and noise cancellation. The ear buds stay in my ear really well. Once they’re in, I don’t have to adjust them at all. I’ve gone on 10 mile runs without having to worry about them at all. I also have no issue with their comfort or ability to stay in during high mobility and high impact workouts.

I haven’t put them through a rough test for waterproofing such as swimming. However, in a heavy rain while out running, there is no degradation in quality, comfort, or connection.

One small downside is that occasionally the left earbud comes out of synchronized with the right earbud and takes a brief second to reconnect. I think this is mostly due to interfering signals. However, it is a rare occurrence. Usually while I’m operating power tools. Again, it doesn’t happen very often.

I don’t give 5-stars for noise cancellation because the cancellation isn’t active cancellation and depends on how much of a deal in your ear you can get from the rubber ear pieces. I never get a perfect seal, despite the different sizes. However, it works well enough that I dont have to worry about my lawnmower drowning out the sound.

Overall, these are lightweight, comfortable, high quality, and a good set of ear buds. They charge quickly and the charging case does as well. I love how compact they are and having them in my pocket everywhere I go. I appreciate the indicator lights that show operation and battery level. There are lots of good features for a solid set of headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Get a set of Comply Audio Pro - SmartCore foam replacements and this is 5-star,"I originally bought a pair of high end Jaybirds but the manual said do not use in the shower, so I took them back. My use case is listening to podcasts (mostly spoken words, interviews, etc. I.e. not music) in the shower. I used to use a Bluetooth speaker for this and just crank it up, but then I had a newborn so can’t wake him.

I am “wow-ed” by these little guys!!!! SOooo much cheaper than the Jaybirds and they’re actually usable in the shower. I’ve had them for several weeks and have not run into issues, and have only had to charge them once or twice.

I deduct a star because the stock ear bud fits my ear and seals ok, but it can shift and then the sound isn’t matched between earbuds. I bought a set of Comply Audio Pro - SmartCore foam replacements and the difference is noticeable. The bass hits much harder and the seal is much better.

I have no qualms recommending these, and the price is fantastic. I’m pleasantly surprised.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Now I'm just sad.,"Extremely disappointed. They paired nicely, had a good fit and sounded great for almost 10 seconds! Then the left ear bus kept going out every few seconds.

Once I started playing music through them I was even more impressed. The sound quality was amazing in the base was pretty impressive.

Good set of Earbuds.  Some connection issues when in an area with strong signals.,"The earbuds seem to work well so far.  I do have some repeatable sound drop outs when walking through certain parts of my commute.  Must be strong signals in the area.  This is in a major train station.  The other issue I have, is the buttons on the earbuds require you to press pretty hard on them, forcing the buds hard into your ear, and making an uncomfortable air pressure sound in your ear.  The buttons are of the detent types, and not just touch sensitive buttons.  The case for the earbuds, is also a little large, making it hard to keep in your pocket.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Almost Great, almost....","It sucks that I have to write this, because these headphones are almost a great buy. So here is the deal, they have great sound, great range, actually VERY good range as I've walked 30ft from my device and still had connection. But here is the problem, everytime I want to use my headphones I have to listen to the most annoying beeping sound for a solid 10 minutes. EVERY TIME. Due to the nature of my work I  use one headphone, and so when I go to use the left bud it will start searching for the right one and thats what causes the beeping sound.  There is no way to disable this, some suggest that yo simply take out the other bud and put it in your pocket but when I try that my device will loose connection. Its possible that this is caused by malfunctioning devices so that will not effect my review.

Here is the deal, I would LOVE to give this 5 stars, if they were to produce an app or put a button on the charger device that disables the buds from searching than I would for sure change the rating. It's so damn annoying having to listen to a beep every 10 seconds for 10 minutes when I want to use my device.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I've got an amazing pair of Bose noise canceling headphones and use them frequently for gaming/PC sessions, but they're not at all ideal for working out, so I bought these wireless earbuds, and while it's not the most amazing sound quality I've ever heard, I'm pretty impressed.  Sounds nice and blocks out a decent amount of noise.  HOWEVER, one glaring negative that doesn't particularly bother me too much (but may deter you from purchasing) is that the sound sometimes cuts out on the left earbud.  I've literally sat down right in front of my phone, browsing Spotify, only to have it cut out several times in a row.  That was an isolated incident, though, and since then, it's only cut out maybe 1-2 times a day for about 1-2 seconds.  It's not a deal breaker for me, though, and despite this annoyance, I really enjoy these earbuds.

-- COMFORT --
I tend to get some discomfort from earbuds after wearing them for ten minutes, but with the smallest size, I've been able to wear these earbuds for 2-3+ hours with very minimal discomfort.  All I need to do is slightly adjust it when it gets a little uncomfortable, and I'm good to go again.  In addition, I don't have an issue with these falling out of my ears while working out, so that's a plus, too!

-- OVERALL IMPRESSIONS --
Pretty design, convenient wireless charging, good sound quality, very comfortable, and fantastic deal for the price.  But I had to knock off a star because of the sound randomly cutting out in the left earbud.  Otherwise, absolutely love these!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty Good Buy,"So far no issues and complete satisfaction. Customer Service very quick with responding to inquiries of Warranty coverage information. Great for initial purchase purpose, when trying to speak on the phone people are unable to hear me clearly unfortunately.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Volume Control,"Despite the false claim in the Amazon Q&A Board, these earbuds do not have touch control to adjust the volume.  For my application, this was necessary.

If volume control at the earbud is import to you, it is important to know these earbuds are completely lacking this functionality.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome buds/ Excellent Customer Service,"Amazing product for the price. These bluetooth buds are the highest quality. Amazing waterproof case, charging dock,sturdy and built to the highest quality.

They have a great customer service staff.

Great headphones,"Really good headphones for the price, hold the charge pretty well, waterproof (so far tested under rain), noise cancellation is great. Buttons work as described, no issues there (used with iPhone).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy Connnection,The fabulous way it connects it connects is just great. fast and easy. I also love the compact case that contains these marvelous ear buds. You know when the case is charged and the buds are charged.. Makes ii a no guessing game like others. They fit securely with the multiple covers they provide. I can't say anything more than just get them. The price is good the quality is the best. No others will do...,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lives up to the 5 stars,"I recently upgraded to an iPhone XR and was looking for some wireless earbuds for working out in.  These work great! Very easy to pair with my phone and I like that they pair with themselves automatically out of the charging case.  The sound cut out on me briefly a couple times but I think it’s because I was at the gym and was competing for a signal with everyone else. Sound quality is good-very clear with just enough bass for my liking.

Overall, I’m very happy with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value. More pros than cons. Worth it.,Great value. Sound is great for a wireless earbud. Takes a bit getting used to as when u insert it in ur ear u have to allow it to sync then adjust at times to achieve the full surround sound. Sounds a bit confusing but when u put it in ur ears you'll know what I'm referring to. It will fall out at times and u will find urself adjusting it BK in ur ear. I wouldn't try to run with these but I would lift weights with them.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds,Great earbuds!  I’ve never used earbuds before but I am very satisfied with the quality and sound. Highly recommend them to anyone!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not Very Good For Calls,"I found them to sound better when I first place them in my ear and they don't move around, because once they do, the deep bass goes. I did find them to stay in my ear pretty well during a workout that included running. As far as voice calls, I found that the microphone must be awkwardly placed because the person I talked to had trouble hearing me at times, especially if I was trying to have a private conversation.

I wouldn't buy them again, because I would prefer to have something that allows for better call quality.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
NOT WATERPROOF,"These earbuds are NOT WATERPROOF. I bought these to swim laps with and they are absolutely unusable.

The instructions say “waterproof” and then “(you cannot dip it into water)”",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can't beat the price!,"Just got these babies in the mail. Straight out of the box, they feel solid in my hand and the construction appears to be well made. They already have a charge on them as well as the case. That's pretty legit, most electronic devices do not provide the luxury of connect and go straight out of the box. I bought these because I bought a pair of JBL Endurance headphones a week ago. The sound on these headphones put the JBLs to shame! everything is better as far as I can tell straight out of the box. I cannot speak to the longevity yet, but best believe I am going to get some serious use out of these, so I shall return for an update later on. But so far, 4 starts for the initial review. My impression is that I will upgrade them to a 5 after long term use.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Low Battery, Great Sound","While I love the charging case and the audio quality, the battery life is beyond terrible. I can't go more than an hour without changing them. Luckily each headphone earpiece can be used individually so if I go one earbud at a time I get maybe two hours.

If the battery life were longer, this product would easily get a 5/5 stars for mobility and audio quality. It is a shame that I cannot use it longer.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Had to return, kept losing Bluetooth connection.","Worked great with big exceptions.
1) kept losing Bluetooth connection when I had my phone in my pocket just walking at a normal pace. So I kept hearing over and over the little beeps it makes when it loses connection and also when it reconnects.
2) too much bass, if you like nothing. It big bass in your music, you’ll probably love these. But for me there’s a time and a place. So when I put on some hip hop or electronic music they sounded pretty decent. However when I wanted to change it up to country, oldies, or classic rock, they sounded so bad with all that bass and couldn’t enjoy my listening experience. Ended up returning them.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left Ear bud cuts out (Updated 8/8/19),"Truly a 1 Star experience with these, Left ear bud cuts out very frequently even on the replacement set.

8/08/19: Went on a 30 minute walk this morning with Replacements... Cut out about once everyone minute or two. Super frustrated and upset. Returning for a REFUND and will look else where for a quality pair that works as it's supposed to.

8/07/19: Received replacement set. Went for 45 minute walk, seems to be promising, only cutout once or twice.

8/04/19: Day 2 of trying to use Earbuds.... Still having cutting in and out issues with Left ear bud, getting super frustrating. Tried many different pairing tricks others suggested with no luck.
Just submitted a Request for replacement from Amazon. Will update once replacement arrives.

8/03/19:
Just got these earbuds today. Was easy to pair to phone and started listening to music within seconds.... that's about the end of the positives.

Put phone in pants pocket and started my walk... 30 seconds in I notice the left cutting in and out every 10 seconds or so. I stand still and it works fine... start walking and left bud cuts in and out time to time.

I turn buds off.. unpair and forget device from phone. Turn buds on they pair to each other and say ""right channel"", ""left channel"".. i then pair to phone and all seems well again... until i start walking. Left cuts in and out every 10 seconds or so....

They seem to work only if you sit still but that is NOT what I bought them for. I NEED something for walking. Will try few extra tips and if no resolve, will return for replacement or refund.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Stopped working after a couple months,Can no longer get them to connect to my phone via bluetooth......even before that they needed to be charged after roughly 6 hours. Don't buy.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Device for music lover and must go with phone calls,"Superb sound quality, specially when i paired with my phone used for phone calls, I found like i got the device which i was looking for, i am using now for daily workout, running, while driving and also for business calls. Easily i can pair and connect for my business calls and freely i can do other work like coding, eating etc. A device i would recommend  we must try and feel the difference. Build for music lover with great wireless feature. Very ease for phone calls and for working out.
Sound quality is not high what I expected specially when i am comparing with Bose headphone or earbuds  but defenetaly price difference is there. we can not simply compare with Bose where you have to pay almost 4-5 times. However i am enjoying this new buddy and found a new reason to use my phone and other devices :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Totally TOZO - Best Earbuds Ever!!!,The product was delivered on-time as scheduled. Opened it up and was very impressed with the packaging and the charger-case.  Now to performance.....The sound clarity and quality is top-notch!  The feel and comfort in the ear is remarkable and a pleasant change.  I highly recommend TOZO earbuds!!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Register the Warranty and Tozo Will Help,"Impressed with this little bundle and the features offered at a great price. A little disappointed at the distance Bluetooth tes mots if using in water.

About six months into having these, one bud stopped charging. I contacted the company and they promptly responded in helping me resolve this issue.

Update: upgraded from four to five star because as promised, the company was excellent in sending me a replacement pair and very quickly!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid wireless earbuds option that won’t break the bank.,"Great sound, awesome value. I lost a pair of expensive wireless ear buds and it was so frustrating, but I didn’t want to give up the freedom of wireless earbuds. I decided to try a less expensive option. I noticed these had a lot of good reviews, and they have not disappointed. They sound great. They pair easily. And they still look decent. They charge very quickly and they hold a charge very well. This is definitely a solid second option for those who don’t want to spend a lot on earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product and great customer service!,"The TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds have great sound quality, especially in relation to what you're paying for them! I had an aesthetics issue with one of them 6 months after I bought them and contacted TOZO directly. They shipped me a new pair and told me to keep the original. Allie in their service department was a joy to work with. She definitely knows how to keep her customer happy!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy Peasy!,What an amazing company and product I received my new earbuds quickly. They were easy to connect to my cell phone and the sound quality is outstanding.  The kit comes with different ear sizes to attach to the buds for an easy fit.  They are easy to charge with their neat compact charging case.  Considering buying my wife a pair for Mother’s Day. She loved mine :). I strongly recommend the company and the ear buds! I’ll buy them again.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FAKE REVIEWS,"Many of the reviews are fake. The sound cuts out constantly, the earbuds do not pair to each other or to devices, the battery time is lower than advertised.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better then I expected...Looking forward to using these more and more,"I like that these came with several different options for sizing in the ear.  I was able to find one that didn't ever seem to make my ear sore.  I don't believe I have ever had that before.  I haven't used earbuds a really long time because they just never worked out for me.  I wore these for several hours when I got them prior to doing any charge or anything and was extremely satisfied with sound quality and comfort.  I haven't done much other then working around the house so I can update once I take them to the gym or some other environment.  I don't foresee any issues though.  Great product.

UPDATE:  I have tried all of the different sized ear pieces.  When jogging they tend to slip out.  I'm constantly adjusting them to keep them in.  Walking is fine but jogging/running is when I always have to push them back in...  It probably has more to do with my ears then anything.  Just thought I would update.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are great value,I got these headphones on self for 30 bucks and I use them every day despite them being small at earbuds they stay in your ears their waterproof and their sound is surprisingly clear,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic value,"I have used many bluetooth earbuds so I have some experience to differentiate and compare.  These actually have pretty good sound and strong bass.  Pairing is probably the best I have used and instantly connect without issue.  I do want to point out I could pair these earbuds to my 2017 MacBook Pro, but they consistently go in and out.  Not just some of the time, but all of the time.  So if you plan on using these with a MacBook Pro I would pass on these.  If they are just for a smartphone then these are great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BEST EARBUDS,"I loved these earbuds from the moment I got them. I usually have a problem with earbuds of any kind staying in my ears which these do. The sound is also amazing I have bought some dj headphones before and the sound is way better than those I am genuinely impressed with these ear buds.
I HIGHLY recommend these they are worth your money",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unethical follow up,"The earbuds are.. ok.  Battery life is crap & takes an hour to charge.

Great sound Quality and even Better Customer Service,When I first got these ear buds they werent working properly but the sound quality was amazing. So Tozos customer service reached out to me and handled the issue quickly and promptly. I got a new set and I couldnt be happier. This earbuds are some of the best quality ear buds in sound I have personally ever heard. I tend to wear the bigger headphones for the bass and good sound quality but with the technology getting better I decided to give these a shot and they do not disappoint!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bluetooth Earbuds I've had yet!,"This is the 14th(!!) pair of bluetooth earbuds I've purchased on Amazon for the past two years (including name brands like Jaybird, Anker, etc.) and for me, they beat all the others.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So Far So Good,"Just got them and so far so good, I thought they'd be a little smaller but it doesn't bother me at all, in fact I fell asleep with one of them on, but did freak out when I woke up cos it wasn't in my ear anymore, but I'll take the blame for that.

In terms of sound quality it's great, connectivity range is good and overall very satisfying.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound quality,"The sound quality is amazing. You don’t have to buy the Apple headphones. I have not had much luck with earbuds. I have one of those ears where nothing fits. This one does, and very well. The sound quality is excellent. I recommend this to all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
COULD BE so great... but are not.,"I WANTED these to be awesome.  They're not, because:

The left earbud keeps disconnecting.  Seems fine for a few minutes, then you do something crazy, like... turn your head.  Or touch your hat.  Or God forbid, you touch the other earbud.  Then the left one cuts out for a second.

So you know, I thought it was a fluke, so I exchanged them for another pair.  SAME THING.  Then I read that a lot of other people were experiencing the same thing.

If they ever decide to fix this and make a pair that stay connected, I would buy them again in a heartbeat, as they were great for the price.  But without consistency, not worth fifty cents, let alone fifty dollars.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality ear buds,"Solid set of ear buds for a good price.  Actually tried them in the shower today, just because I could.
Pairing was very easy, and sound quality is impressive.  Level of Bass was surprising.
As expected, using for phone calls is tough with the location of the microphone.
Noice isolation works well, and ear buds fit snuggly and securely.  Overall a great purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product - great customer service,"I bought these headphones a couple months ago and have used them nearly daily since I purchased them. I use them for working out and for my bike commute to work as well as any other leisure bike rides.
The headphones fit in my ears very well and stay fairly snug. As other reviewers have mentioned, make sure to try the different earbud sizes for the best fit to minimize any chance of them falling out. I had mine start falling out once I would get a bit sweaty on the treadmill, however this issue was averted when I moved a size up. Sound quality is on point. I have never worn these headphones for longer than 1.5 hours each day, and usually wear them for a few days in a row and they stay charged up in the case before I have to recharge again. The noise cancellation is decent, but not really noticeable above what regular headphones provide. Regardless, that's not what I bought them for and I can hear my music clearly while wearing them, which is what I really care about.
Finally, I want to touch on the customer service. I reached out to customer service about an issue I had with the headphones (not a product defect, this was primarily a user error) and they not only responded within a couple hours, but went above and beyond to provide a solution for my issue. I was astounded by how fast they got back to me throughout our correspondence as I could hardly keep up with them.
These headphones are absolutely worth the buy and I will keep TOZO on my radar for any other products I need.
Hope this review helps you make an informed decision.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality!,"I have had several sets of wireless earbuds before and, while I’ve only had these for a couple of days, I can tell you that the sound quality is significantly better than my previous ones.

My older ones tended to malfunction after a couple of months, so the extended one year warranty is a comforting feature.

Quite happy so far!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't quite fit my tiny ears but great sound quality,"So far so good, took them for literal test run around the neighborhood while jogging at light pace, moderate sweat, noise cancellation and sound quality were excellent! Sweat didn't seem to affect them, waterproofing appears intact. Only problem is even after adjusting for different ear bud since, the unit as a whole is a little too thick for my ears and sticks out, doesn't stay lodged against the auricle of my ear as the wearing guide advises. While running at night I was worried abt them falling out and losing them while moving vigorously, so I sport taped them to my ears. They stayed in fine walking around the house though! I will try running with them in daylight or at the gym to see how well they stay in, when I have less chance of losing them if they do fall out.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Initial impression is good.,"This is an initial impression review.  Just came off the truck while I was doing yard work. Packaged well within its own box. The box seems to be made out of the same plastic that small 12v power supplies are made of so its durable for sure.

 For a moment I thought that if you only wanted to use one bud with the other in its case you could only use the right bud. If you  take one out of your ear and put it in the box to charge it will do so uninterrupted.  But if you take it back off the charger you will need to power cycle.  I assume the right ear bud is the ""master bud"" or something.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprising quality,"Wife bought me these for Father's Day, and given the price point, I would have to say these are a very nice quality wireless/bluetooth ear bud.  They have a high quality feel and sound, including the case, which cleverly dual-functions as a magnetic holder and charger for the buds.  So far, quite pleased!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless earbuds done right!,"This is the best wireless earbuds I’ve ever had.  The simple connection and the sound quality is amazing.  I wish I pick this up years ago.  I bought a lot of wireless earbuds before l, this is the best out not all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quit scrolling and buy these!!!!,Amazing Sound Quality. Crank to the max with no distortion. I have issues with ear buds fitting. These fit perfect with the stock inserts. I can't hear a thing but music while mowing. Stoked I chose this set.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound not the best connectivity,The sound quality is not the best I have heard but is definitely very good with good bass and range of sounds. Noise cancelling is pretty good. Can barely hear somebody talking to me with the earbuds in. This is my first set of truly wireless earbuds. I really like the freedom but they do not stay in my ear as good as I had hoped. I followed the directions and are using the biggest rubber piece. I usually use these for running. They will stay in my ear pretty well but have to reset them in my ear every few minutes. I did have one Fallout the other day because I did not catch it early enough. That would discourage me from using these for mountain biking or snowboarding. I am quite a sweater and my ears get pretty wet so not all may have this problem. My biggest problem with these is the connectivity. I can set my phone down and walk across the gym with very good connectivity but when I put the phone against my body like a pocket they have a hard time staying connected. The first set I got were really bad. I called for tech support and they had me try a couple Placebo type fixes that did not seem to work. I returned them for another set and the second set seem to work much better but still have issues if I have my phone in my pocket. I usually run with a waste belt that holds my phone and this seems to work much better.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I really wanted these to work but they do not,"Bought these to workout in the gym or to listen while doing yardwork
and quite honestly
they don’t stay connected to my iPhone or other Bluetooth devices I have tried to work with
if you move your head too fast the left side disconnects for the right side,
it’s very frustrating that it is so sensitive or weak
I would not buy these again
but I don’t wanna go through the hassle of sending them back
so I put them next to my bed and put them in maybe when I’m taking a nap..
USELESS for the gym...

Great quality and very impressive sound!,"After searching high and low for a pair of wireless ear buds I finally stumbled upon the Tozo T10s. I tried a lot of other brands even my brothers apple airpods, but the volume was low and no bass. As soon as I received the Tozos I was impressed with the packaging and build quality. They didn't feel cheap whatsoever. Popped them in and was blown away with the sound quality! Crisp highs and deep lows. The bass rivals my Beats over ear headphones. Very easy to pair to my phone it only took a few seconds. I would highly recommend these ear buds and look forward to putting them to serious use!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great but question,"I received this yesterday and have used it quite I a bit thus far. I like it. Easy to use, charges easily, sound is clear, feels comfortable in my ear. When I made my first phone call with it, the person I spoke with could not hear me. My second call the person heard me but the call and connection were dropped. I'm hoping that it gets better. I love the fit and convenience, but can't have headphones where the other person does not hear me.

UPDATE: A few weeks have passed and people still can't hear me clearly on phone calls. I would not recommend this product for anything other than listening to music/videos. It's not useful for phone calls.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can't beat this product for the price!,"After looking for a pair of wireless headphones for quite some time I decided on these. I am extremely happy with this decision so far. The battery life of the individual ear pieces isn't great. However; having the charging case with you easily allows you to use them all day with some short breaks to charge.
I briefly tested the water proof feature in the shower and had no issues with connection or sound quality. I have read others had issues with sound quality when submerged so your mileage may vary on that.
With the different size caps for the ear pieces it should be easy to find a fit that matches your ears although I found the original size to be the best fit for me.
I mainly use these for work calls and the mic works fine indoors. This may not be the case if you were to be on a call when working out.
Very easy to set up and connect with my phone. The buttons are very simple and intuitive to understand so I got the hang of it in no time!

Overall very satisfied with my purchase 5/5!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for the price,"I wasn't looking for anything really cheap, or anything expensive. I read some of the reviews and they all said how good the quality of the sound is, and I have to agree. It has good base and relatively good sound. My only caveat is that you can't just use one ear bud. both need to be on, otherwise there is a beeping noise, and sometimes I only need one ear bud.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality!,"Surprisingly great sound, very light weight headphones that feel like they are constructed properly.  They connect to your device very quickly, and are smartly programmed to turn on and off when you remove them from the charger.

My only gripe is that I wish the charging case was much smaller as it feels very light, and the headphones don’t seem to take up much space within it.  I understand there’s a battery inside, but it seems there’s a lot of wasted space and I would love for the case and headphones to fit in my pocket more easily.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
so far so good,Just had these a couple days but so far so good. Good fit after I changed to small size. Mostly listen to digital books and sound is totally satisfactory.

I really wanted this to work,"Disconnects randomly. It is very big and does not fit in my ear. And I am a big guy, if it does not fit my ear, I do not know how it will fit to anybody. Microphone is very weak. Other party cannot hear what I am saying.

True meaning of customer service,"I highly recommend buying this product, not only is it great! But service is also excellent. I lost my earphones and it was hassle free getting it replaced, most sellers give you trouble but no not this seller. They are loud and everything you want in good Quality earphones.

"They are good when they are working, but pairing is annoying, hurt my ears","Honestly not sure how this gets such great reviews.

Pairing is a pain... sometimes. Sometimes it's simple but then sometimes I need to put it in and out of the case 10 times before it decides to cooperate. Or even more annoying is when it won't unpair, so I'm trying to play something from my phone and it won't stop playing through the headphones, even though the headphones are in the case.

Also they hurt my ears after too long. Especially not good if you plan to be wearing under a hat. With a hat it puts so much pressure on my ears I can't do it.

They stay in well most of the time, but not so well when sweating.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better value than AirPods,"I love these! Didn’t want to spend the $$ on AirPods, and these had great reviews and were a better price. I bought them in white and love the color. It comes with different size ear pieces (the silicone piece that goes inside your ear) for different sized ears and once I switched to the smaller size, they fit perfectly. Haven’t tested the waterproof quality yet, but the sound is great, and I can’t hear much else when they’re in. I recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Apple air pods got nothing on these babies,"So happy I bought these, the sound quality was definitely there although they are by no means noise cancelling (muffling maybe). A few times i caught myself unsure whether I was wearing them or not because I wasn't sure if the sound was coming from a speaker out loud. Super convenient, they free up my hands and I don't have to worry about a wire hitting me in the face while I run. I would buy as a gift for family because of the quality that you get for such a great price, I love it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I really enjoy it.,"I recently purchase TOZO T10 and really enjoyed the product.
PROs,
  1.Bluetooth really easy to set up,
  2.Sound quality is great, i really love base, though it is on the high end of the spectrum.
  3.they are water RESISTANT! so you can have them in the shower, you can do laps on top of a pool but they are
  NOT meant for submersion.
  4.It comes with (excuse me for not knowing the exact term) some different size earbud plastic cover, so if the one
  doesn't fit or doesn't feel right you try putting on the other ones on.They fit perfectly onto me and not really
  worried about them falling out.
  5.wireless charger case, so if you can a wireless charger or a smart phone that can support wireless charging that
  really good if you don't use the wired charger.
  6.really good battery life, it says 3.5 hours, however I didn't have them on no longer 2 hours and when I put them
  away, the case would be charging the buds so thats pretty nice and I can honestly say I never had them died out
  on me unexpectedly.
  7. this is just a already added feture but does a pretty nice job block outside sound. Sometimes I just put them on
  and don't turn it on just to muffle/ lower sound when Im practicing guitar. I like to practice a lot but that can
  hurtful to you're ears if you don't have ear protection, so that's nice.

Dislikes
1.it does come with a charger for the case if you don't a wireless charger, but its kinda small. not that big a deal though.
2.No mic built in I believe, but if did I doubt it be water proof now. would be nice to have both.

Summery, I really enjoy it. I don't really have anything against it. I love the battery life on this as well as the sound quality, though I more of a low end guy so if possible to configure that, i think would be even more amazing. the charger that it comes with is kinda small but i usually just put it next to my laptop so its pretty to nice to look at sometimes with the lights on telling me its charging. Overall its a nice, fair product. Not much to complain. love going to gym with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good headphones for the price,They have good sound quality and the battery lasts a good while. I like that you can take the charger on the go in case you need to charge while working out or are just on the go. But they do not stay in your ears very well when running. As soon as you start to work up a good sweat and you are running they fall our super easy and its a hassle to constantly stick them back in or if they did fall out to look around for them.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No need to stop the music in the water.,"These are amazing.
The first day, one of them fell into a sink with water and it was working perfectly well all the time.
When you get out of work listening music and you get home and you can literally go to the shower without stopping the music...Great!!!! (excellent sound quality and noise cancellation)
Fast pairing with my Laptop and Phone. Really good for PC gaming.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great budget headphones, ideal for workout","Great headphones that arrived fast. My other headphones are Jaybird bluetooth and a Sony WH-1000XM3. These headphones are ideal for the gym and running. With the multiple sizes of attachments, it should fit snugly for nearly all ear types. The sound is good and has some decent bass. Overall the sound and fit are better than my Jaybirds which I would use for gym/running. As a bonus they are water/sweatproof. They are lightweight which is great. The case is small and the wireless charging is great. It easily fits into my pocket. Obviously the sound cannot compare to my Sony headphones but thats not why I bought them.

If youre looking for a pair of good sounding wireless in ear headphones that fit snugly that also feature wireless charging, look no further.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sound quality is good but it keeps falling out, buy separate earbud tips","The earbuds would be pretty great if they could actually stay in the ear. Tried all the different ear tips/molds but they never stay in. Especially when talking or moving. I really want to like these earbuds but they basically don't work cause cause they can't stay in place; had to buy additional earbud tips for the tozo to stay in but even then, the slightest movement can move them around a little, ultimately loosening.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Finally getting sleep with noise cancellation!,"I listen to music every evening to help me fall asleep. I got tired of getting wrapped up in my wired headphones. I tried those bluetooth set specifically for sleeping (looks like an eye mask) but it made my head too hot and uncomfortable. So I woke up multiple times in the evening. This product is great so far! Excellent sound quality (actually much louder than I thought it would be) and awesome noise cancellation. Best of all, no more getting choked by wires and so far I’m sleeping through the night.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Connectivity issues,"I wanted to like these earbuds.  They have a nice look, feel and sound was good with enough bass.  I was able to run in these without issues.  I used them for a little over a week until I started to have an issue with the left earbud.  The first time I noticed, the left earbud lost sound for about 2 seconds and only one time.  However, today I was losing connectivity multiple times a minute with the phone less than 2 feet away from my ears.  Sorry, but I'm returning.  Too soon for a $50 pair to have issues.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good quality for price, fit varies depending on your ear shape.","These are the first wireless earbuds that I've used, so in terms of ease of use, I have nothing to compare to. However, they are just as good as any wired in-ear earbuds, just more convenient because you don't need to have your phone close by to listen to music. I use these earbuds for casual listening, and they have worked perfectly when connected to my iPhone. However, when connected to an older Macbook, the sound can get spotty since the Bluetooth isn't as strong.
In terms of comfort, they don't fit my ears as closely as I'd like. Although the manufacturer includes 4 pairs of ear bud tips in varying sizes, my ears fall somewhere in between, so it's not an exact fit. Also, the instructions for wearing the earbuds indicate that you have to twist them horizontally until they lock around the inside ridge of your ears, but my ears are a little larger in that area, and so they tend to sit loosely. They have fallen out of my ears before, so I don't plan on heavy exercise with them in.
Overall, they do seem to be waterproof, have a decent sound quality (but don't expect deep bases or an ""open"" sound), and charge very easily in the provided case. It is an acceptable quality for the price.
P.S. the earbuds are not noise-proof, since there's no noise-cancellating technology in it, but it does block some external sound due to them being in-ear.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
YES!,"Okay I love these.  I even accidentally threw one in the washing machine, and they are still working!  I just wish the little ear pieces came in smaller sizes.  The smallest ones are still to big for my ears, and it drives me nuts after about 30 minutes.  Even with that, I love them and the sound and quality is amazing.  I highly recommend these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Hits it just right,"Sound quality
4.5/5
Bass hits and I'm a bass head. Can alter this with your phones equalizer but I know that fat bass is not for everyone.

Noise Cancelling
4/5
Comes with three sets of bud sizes. Dark grey with red interior accents. Mix and match to your sizing. Not the most noise cancel but with the optimal sound volume, it will keep most noise out at a comfortable level. Also keeps most water out.

Battery
4/5
Been on these for a week but have yet to fully drain these till dead but its rated at 3 hours one charge, then the case for 4 full charges. Doesnt come fully charged out of the box but it works as advertised. There are others that are rated more hours but battery is solid for this price range.

Functionality/Design
4/5
Pairs fast, good sound, sport/shower waterproof but it is a little bulky. Havent tried calling feature yet but for listening to music, this is worth the purchase price. Would recommend 4 out of 5 times.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Deep bass, long battery life, and solid build","These were my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and as an iPhone user I wish I hadn't waited so long... no more lost or broken headphone adapters!

The audio quality is impressive and gives you plenty of bass. Great if you're running or lifting and want to really feel the music and ignore the outside world. If you're not a basshead, the sound might be a bit unbalanced with regards to the mids/highs so don't be afraid to adjust your EQ settings. Given the price, convenience, and build quality I am completely satisfied with the sound. If you're looking for incredibly detailed and nuanced audiophile quality, these are not it... but that's not what they're supposed to be. These are an everyday carry item that perform well in almost any environment.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for me!,"I work in a factory where we can only use one head phone (don't want to step in front of a forklift or under tye crane). Today I was a ble to give a trial run with these. I never had an issue with it falling out, and didn't need to crank the volume to hear. Sound is still perfectly clear in one ear with machine noise in the background. Update: I have been using these for a full week now, and so long as I take the headphone out and place it in it's charging case on my break, the battery lasts me all day.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Horrible, not the same product","I originally bought these bluetooth headphones for my husband (pictured left), he enjoyed them so much and was so satisfied with them I decided to reorder them for myself (pictured right). Upon unboxing, I noticed they were nowhere near the same box and taking the earbuds out, not even the same style. I gave them a try after fully charging them for a night and tried them on a walk. The sound quality was horrid and they kept disconnecting and just finally gave up after less then 10 minutes. Mine will be returned.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
CANT CONTROL MUSIC,The sound is pretty good for the price. Not sure why they say it’s got great bass. It’s almost non-existent. The main thing just bugs me about these are the fact that you can’t control the volume or skip tracks. But you can answer calls?! Seems sorta backwards. I’d rather have control of the music than incoming phone calls which makes these pretty much useless at the gym because now I have to take my phone off the arm band to skip tracks or adjust the volume.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Active Sport Wireless Earbuds,"I have used plenty of wireless earbuds and these are by far the best. Connection wise, batteries, and even staying in place during workouts or heavy runs. I use them all the time around the office and I have synced them up to my iWatch as well. I would say that during sleep or in bed, you cannot lay down with them in your ears as it will be uncomfortable but overall they are extremely pleasant and have great noise cancellation. I definitely would recommend these to you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound way better than i thought,"Punchy bass, good highs/mids. I thought the wireless charging case would be a loss or at least not used. i was wrong, i regularly use that feature. Had them about 2 weeks now, i will say that the blue tooth is glitchy. Here are some of the weird things that have happens with my Samsung note 9:
Lost pairing, like completely lost the buds, had to repair.
Lost pairing again about an hour later.
Had to re dock each earbud in the case to turn it on and off about 2/3 times each to get each bud to pair and then stay connected to play stereo sound. I will see if this continues. if it does i will change my rating.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music,"I bought these ear buds to go with my new Vivoactive 3 Music watch. They arrived quickly. The package had the charger, USB cable, ear buds and an assortment of ear caps. My charger had 3 blue dots indicating almost a full charge right out of the box. No need to wait for the first charge. The ear buds paired with the watch easily and have good sound. I am still experimenting with the ear caps for the best passive noise cancellation for me. I have not run any battery life tests for the ear buds yet since the watch only has a 5 hour battery life when playing music. I think the buds will outlast the watch in play time if I alternate left and right buds in the charger.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear piece drops voice,So I received this last weekend and started to recently use it this past week. My left ear piece keeps dropping music...meaning i listen to music but the music turns off quickly from the left earpiece than does the same with the right. It lasts for about a second or two. But for a four minute song i couldnt hear the whole song as it dropped about eight times. I still haven't looked into whether or not the battery last long as I havent used it long. But the material used us decent.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great BUT right earbud works while the left earbud is charging but not vice versa. Disappointing.,"I am one who must be listening to something while I work -- music, old TV shows, whatever. It is ""white noise"" for me as I concentrate on the job at hand.  These earbuds have freed me away from my tablet as I can walk a fair distance away from the tablet and still pick up the signal.  (15' maybe?)

They fit in my ear, and stay, even when I sweat.  However, there is one major flaw I hope they will work on -- the left earbud cannot work without the right earbud!  I listen ALL DAY.  The batteries last between 4-5 hours, if I am remembering correctly.  Great, I thought; I'll use the right earbud and when it dies I'll use the left earbud.  IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  To use the left earbud only, the right earbud must be laying on top of the recharge case, so it is draining its battery the whole time the left earbud is being used.  (My husband is handicapped so I need to keep one ear open to hear him talking to me.) This set is practically perfect, but I do wish they were not rigged to work only out of the charger.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Solid build, good performance.","I bought these on a whim, influenced by the Amazon Daily Deal price. The material quality is good and the earbuds feel sturdy and well made. I experienced some pairing issues with my Windows 10 laptop. At times, it takes a while to get a full stereo connection and I only get sound out of the main, right, earbud. The battery life is about three to three and a half hours. It would be nice if this could be extended.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I was sceptical at first!,"I have to say, i am a dinosaur when it comes to updating technology items for my personal use, but I decided to jump on board with the purchase of these Bluetooth wireless earbuds.  With so many choices to chose from I decided on the TOZO.  From what I have experienced, so far... the quality and sound quality are amazing.  Very crisp and clear.  I am an avid music listener and these have met my needs.  I enjoy the feel in my ears, and with the multiple choices of ear bud sizes they make it easy to pick the correct one.  The compact case is efficient and allows the earbuds to be recharged if you are not near a charging source.  I have not used them in the water, so I cannot vouch for that. If there was anything that I would change, it would be the length of time between charge, when in use.  They last about 3 hours - 4 hrs...but overall, I am thoroughly satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear bud will stop working; Happened to me twice after exchanging the first one.,"These are great sounding BT ear buds with excellent base...  Until the left ear bud stops working.  Happened twice after exchanging the first set for the same reason.  The left ear bud will start working intermittently.

- If they get wet, the microphone won't work well.  People on a call will won't hear you well.
- You can't skip a song or go back to the previous song.  This is annoying since it's a feature people would use often.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good Price and Good Sound,I've been without a bluetooth headset for several months because I just couldn't figure out which ones I wanted to get after my LG and Samsung went out. I read the reviews on several pairs of bluetooth/wireless earbuds before deciding on purchasing TOZO T10. I have to say that I'm satisfied with my purchase. The sound quality is very good whether I'm listening to music or holding a conversation on the telephone.

Good set of wireless headphones at a great price.,The sound quality and noise cancellation are great (especially for the price). The fit farally well.

very nice workout earbuds,"Was using it for a few days and can tell you that i have few thinks that i really liked.
First sound quality- the bass was very solid (considering that those are earbuds) and also the sound was very clear. Noise cancelation was pretty good, although there is some room for improvement for a future models.
Charging is super easy and fast, battery life also as described in the product descrpt. Pairing is also easy and faster than on the other earbuds that i possesed in the past.
I can definitely recommend this product for a young people that enjoys working out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Probably the best Bluetooth headphones I have found,"I have tried numerous wireless headphones with mixed success. I was quite nervous to try these as the last pair of earbud headphones I bought wouldn’t hold a charge for more than 30 min and would cut out if I put my phone in my pocket.

I am happy to report these headphones do not suffer those restrictions. The first day I took them to work I forgot the charging case and was worried they would die on me, thankfully they lasted all day with moderate use.

I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks periodically throughout the day, and to make phone calls. I work in maintenance and often need to speak with customer service or a vendor while using my hands for something else- I have had no complaints of people not being able to hear me with these headphones (a common problem with many of my previous pairs). In addition the sound quality has been excellent. The one downside that I have found is that when using only one earbud (it must be the right one as that is the “master”) there is a soft beeping to indicate it is trying to connect the left side. It is not so loud as to be annoying but I do wish there were a way to tell the system you are only using a single earbud so it stops trying.

Another issue with pairing is that it often takes upwards of 1 minute before it finally pairs with the phone. I believe this is caused by it searching for the other earbud - which is still in the charging case and therefore not in pairing mode.

Also while running with both earbuds I found that the left one would cut out periodically when I turned my head. I rarely use the left earbud, however this may bother some people.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for a great price,So far these earbuds are great. I have only used them for a day so looking forward to using for a long time to come.

There is no discomfort whatsoever, and the white case and earbuds make it so it's very difficult to misplace, and if i do lose them, i find them just as fast. I've dropped the case a few times accidentally, and the case has easily weathered these small accidents. i found it very convenient that the case came with an optional cord to tie it securely to whatever i want, in order to hang it or keep it in a secure spot! it also came with a free warranty in case of any trouble which i found very nice.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

High Quality for a Low Price!,"So, I've been an over-the-ear headphones guy my whole life. Earbuds tend to hurt my ears after a while, and I've found it's very difficult to beat the sound quality of good over-the-ear headphones. Having said that, these earbuds come really, REALLY close.
The sound quality is better than anything I've ever found in any earbuds I've worn in the past; listening through them really wasn't very different than listening with my over-the-ear headphones. The bass is satisfyingly powerful, and when seated properly, the high notes come out rich and full, instead of tinny and pitchy like with most other earbuds. They also fit very comfortably enough in my ears that I don't worry about them falling out, and while I haven't tested the battery capacity to its limits quite yet, they last long enough that I haven't yet had them die on me in the middle of my walks around town, which can sometimes take up to two or three hours. Even if they had, though, they can recharge right in the case, which can hold up to FOUR full charges before the case needs to be recharged again! That's incredible! As for the mic, I haven't used it much, but those I've spoken on the phone with while using these headphones never complained about the sound quality, even after my asking them, so at the very least I can say with confidence that the mic is good enough for casual conversations over the phone.
I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase. My biggest gripe about over-the-ear headphones was that they get uncomfortable after a while/they're uncomfortable to wear while doing certain things, but these earbuds completely solve that problem! I even use them to help me fall asleep when I'm feeling restless. 100% would recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

These earbuds are FANTASTIC and so is the customer service.,"I needed a new pair of earbuds for work and my wife surprised me with these. At first I was a little skeptical because I've never heard of the brand, but I gave these a chance and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and build quality. I've owned many of the high dollar brands before and these sound, look and feel way more expensive than they are. For the price you can't go wrong. They are waterproof (I use them in the shower), come with their own wireless charging case, the cancel out noise very well and they sound AWESOME! I was a little worried they wouldn't be loud enough, but they are plenty loud. They are as loud as your phone or other device will allow. For these features and quality you should expect to spend many more times the asking price, but TOZO is doing us all a favor and are offering these at a great deal.

I did have an issue with my set though when they first came in... At first they worked awesome but out of nowhere the right earbud just stopped working and nothing I tried would resolve the issue. Fortunately these come with a warranty (which is another thing you won't find at this low price point) so I contacted customer service and they helped resolve my issue straight away. Customer service was helpful, polite and FAST to act on my issues and everything has been sorted out to my satisfaction.

TOZO gained a fan for the long haul in me and I'm excited to try their other product lines. If you are on the fence, just get these T10 earbuds and I'm sure you'll love them. The product is great and customer service is great. Save the money you would spend on a far more expensive product and use that to buy some more music.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome Product,"Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Totally worth the buy!,"I really like these earbuds! They stay in your ear and don’t fall out. The sound quality is good and they aren’t uncomfortable to wear. The one thing I don’t lik is that there is no way to operate the music with them, so when you want to change the song or volume, you have to do it manually. But that is a minuscule issue compared to how perfect these earbuds work. Totally recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Won't stay connected with my TV,"Tazo bluetooth earbuds worked pretty good with my phone, however not with my Samsung TV.
They paired easily and started up, but every few seconds they would disconect and reconnect.  Impossible to use.
I thought perhaps I had volume too loud.  Then I removed and repaired.  Tried numerous efforts and finally decided it's not going to work out.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than I had expected,"Really like these.  I bought them to use in the pool and hot tub I use after my workouts.  I have  a great set of Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless Headphones I use when I train and didn't expect these waterproof headphones to have good sound quality.  Especially at this price.  I was surprised at the quality of the sound and the fit of these earbuds.  I've had them in underwater without issue, keeping in mind the Bluetooth does not work underwater.  Bluetooth drops when you go under the water and comes right back on when you emerge.  I definitely recommend these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"UPDATED:  Seriously, At this price, go for it. Best cheaper ones out there.","While this doesn't touch the $300+ Jabras for sound quality and range, these are really amazing. The range is just as advertised, though when you approach the 30 ft mark, it cuts out. Occasionally, I find that if the phone is in my back pocket, this also can cause cut out. At the cost of a low end product, these headphones have high mid-tier worth. The bass is clear, it takes serious bass to distort them. They can sound a little tinny at times if the input is mostly treble. I've dropped them so many times and never experienced any issues. I also wear them in the shower from time to time and they are still going strong.

UPDATE: Just a few short days after posting this review, the case stopped accepting a charge. I contacted TOZO and they've not only sent me a replacement case, but also an extra bonus as well, just for the inconvenience. Highly recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent,"Shipment arrived on time, was well packaged, offered registration for a 1 year warranty and followed up with after sale communication.
I am pleasantly surprised and very impressed by the sound quality, and build of the Tozo T10 wireless airbuds.
Clear and crisp with both highs and lows the Tozo T10 is providing a joyous listening experience for my music and movies.

The fit is very comfortable and I am getting about 4 hours continuous playing time.
Great product!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So far better than I expected,"My experience with these has been pretty good so far. For some background, I have about 6-8 earphones/headphones ranging from $30-$300 plus a couple DACs and Amps for them so I definitely care about audio quality. These sound pretty good for the price, the soundstage and bass are tweaked, so they don't sound as natural as neutral earphones but I think most people will probably enjoy the sounds. Bass is more prominent and the soundstage sounds wider. All around very happy with this purchase, definitely worth the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, great warranty service","Overall these are very nice headphones. If you position them correctly in your ears they sound kind of amazing. Even bass notes come through nicely. But it's all about positioning them properly in your ear.  I really was impressed when listening to certain songs with these.  I'm used to tinny sound out of earbuds but these really sound nice.

Only minor issues I have are sometimes I need to manually connect and other issue is that if you connect only one headphone, for a couple minutes that single headphone will beep waiting to connect its partner. It doesn't do this if you use both headphones.

My right headphone went out after only using it for a few weeks but their warrant service is very efficient and had already sent me a replacement within a couple days.  VERY impressive.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exactly what you want in wireless headphones,"WOW is all I can really say. TOZO knows how to make headphones!

APPEARANCE: Stylish clamshell case that tightly snaps, well made ear attachments/adapters in sm med and lrg come with it in case the default ones don’t fit nicely (mine did). Brushed matte black on the headphones looks nice and adds a little extra grip to them. USB port is behind a small rubber tab, perfect to avoid water damage. Comes with a lanyard for some reason, the case doesn’t appear to have any place to loop it into, but not a problem as I never use lanyards.

FUNCTION: EACH earbud can function alone but pair beautifully without any effort. A nice touch is that they announce which channel they are when powering on and pairing (left or right) so you know without having to look for the tiny “l” or “r” on the actual earpiece. INTENSE sound even in the bass.

NOISE CANCELING: This is where these guys blew me away. The seal of the earpiece is perfect such that I can’t hear the person next to me, and can barely hear background noise through them. Tested watching Infinity War and it took turning it up to 50% before I could hear through my music. And even then it’s very muffled, very well done sound management.

TECH: worked with Siri without any effort, answering calls during music pauses music and sound crisp and clear. Spotify sounded amazing and works on iPhone, iPad, Mac and PCs with Bluetooth.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good, but take a while to connect.","Pretty good set of wireless earbuds. The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to connect to your phone.

Otherwise, the sound quality and fit is good.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for everything except at the gym.,"If you want a great set of earbuds that you will not use in the gym get these. they fit nicely into the ear and hold their place, the sound is great. using them for talking on your phone; people can hear you but are saying it sounds like im in a tunnel.

I had to return them only due to that.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A little Bass-y,"Only had for a few weeks so far.
Work great, except for at the gym (which is the main location I want to use them).  Something in the gym is providing terrible BT interference, so my music continuously cuts in and out.  I've tried them in other locations (like work) and do not typically have the same problem.

They do stay in my ear well w/o too much fatigue.  The battery is sufficient for a bit of a work out, and the recharging cases can keep me charged all week long.  I just recharge the case on the weekend and I'm good to go.

The sound is a little bass-y, which is hard for me to say as I enjoy good bass.  With these though, it's easy to get the bass to drown out the rest of the music/vocals.  There are ways around this (a little adjustment on the Spotify equalizer), but shouldn't be necessary.

I do wish I could find a solution for the constant BT Interference I get at the gym, if any one has any suggestions...",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WOW just WOW!,"This is the best pair of BT earphones I have owned. Just amazing how well they fit in the ear and connect with the device.

Amazing Quality and An Amazing Price! Better than expected!,"I bought these as a replacment for my blue tooth my dog ate. At first I wasn't expecting much.

The packaging was the first thing I noticed, then once I opened them the build quality was amazing for what I thought would be a budget set of ear buds. Every detail was more then expexted the charging case was solid and well crafted. The ear buds were spot on with the pictures. The call quality has been amazing regardless of if I use one or both earbuds, and the same goes for the quality of sound while listening to music regardless of the source.

Good headphones would recommend,"Great headphones. The only issue is that my left ear is having difficulties with the seal. But that’s not the earphones fault. I will try a different size cover and hopefully that will keep the left side in place.

"Great Value, fit, and sound",I've tried two other bluetooth earsets that are similar to the apple airpods and they fit and sound wasn't great.  I use these for working out and the fit and waterproof capability is spot on.  I like how they come with additional ear sizes so you can find the right fit.

They come out during long distance runs,"I've been searching for a true pair of wireless headphones and ordered these. I run long distances and was tired of the cord with other options.

There are many positives with these headphones. They sound good (for what they are), sync easily and have a good long charge.

My problem with them is that they don't fit tight during my whole long distance run. After about two miles they start to loosen up in my ear. I'm confident this is due to sweating though as they stay in during my entire strength workouts without problems.

These are great headphones and worth ordering unless you plan to use them ONLY for long distance running. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good quality earbuds for the price,"I've had these earbuds for a couple months now, so I figured I'd leave a quick review.  Ultimately, I'm pretty satisfied with these!

I primarily use them when I'm in the gym.  The reason I actually looked for and bought these earbuds was because my last pair of Sony bluetooth headphones began to crap out after a while (partly, due to sweat), so I needed a quick replacement for working out.  So far, so good!  I don't take them swimming or anything, but they definitely seem to hold up pretty well during vigorous exercise on the treadmill and in the weight room.

My only initial complaint was the actual audio quality.  When the volume is up (>90%), it sounded a little ""staticky"" on some of the highs, especially when there was heavier bass.  When I'm in the gym, though, I don't even really notice if/when that happens anymore.  But, I'd say the overall sound quality is pretty clear at medium, medium-high volume.  Noise cancellation is pretty good, too.

So, when all is said and done, I'd recommend these earbuds.  For the price, I got what I expected and needed.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Ear Buds,"Great ear buds! I've run about 5 times 4 miles using the ear buds and they've done great. I did have to change the ear plug size. I tried the largest first , then mediums. You have to experiment the best way to fit the buds so they stay put but it didn't take but one run to figure it out. I'm sure this voids my warranty but I forgot they were in my running shorts and washed and dried them. I figured they were ruined or at least the sound guilty would be bad but that wasn't the case. They came on no problem and the next morning used them for my run. The case to store and charge them are also a plus.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great quality for the price,"I was surprised at how good the sound quality was for these headphones, especially since they use Bluetooth and they have reasonable price tag. I bought these headphones for use at the gym because I was tired of wires getting in the way of my workout. The headphones generally stay secure in my ears as long as I am not actively trying to shake them out, but they do take a little bit of time to get used to. Running or swimming with them I wouldn’t recommend though. The battery life has not been a problem for me so far, as the portable charging case that they come with is really nice. Anytime I am not using them I just put them in the case and they are good to go for the next time I need them. I haven’t run into any problems with connection between the headphones or my phone either.

Left earbud stops working after 1 week,"Less than a week after receiving these earbuds, the left earbud stopped working. The behavior of the LED light does not mention anything in the instruction manual: it flashes purple non-stop until the battery presumably dies, at which point I can't turn it on. Even after leaving them in a fully charged case for 12 hours, I am unable to turn on the left earbud, let alone have it connect to the right one. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. The only option they give you is to reset the device: too bad I can't do that if the device won't even turn on!

Also, the earbuds fall out all the time and do not stay in the ears. I had to purchase memory foam earbud tips to make the earbuds stay in longer. If you are buying this product, expect to buy your own earbud tips!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good for everyday use, I think a little over priced though.","I still am not sold on these, but I can’t say they’re a bad product.

I own everything Apple, but don’t feel I need the apple AirPods. I prefer wired headphones, but needed something wireless for my workouts. These seemed like a good compromise.

First off, the sound on these is wonderful. The noise canceling is great. When you have both in and music playing you can’t hear anything else. It’s amazing.

My issues comes from pairing.
I usually have to go into my phones Bluetooth and manually click to pair these. The EarPods don’t seem to want to pair automatically.

You cannot switch from one audio device to another easily, its a manual process. I paired them with my Mac and my IPhone, and it always pairs to the Mac first automatically  and then I have to discount it and manually pair it to the iPhone in the settings. I’ve since told it to forget these pods on my Mac, but still doesn’t want to pair automatically with my phone.

If you pair the left first, the right won’t pair, so you then must disconnect the left and then pair the right.

If you want to use only the right earpod - you still have to remove both pods from their pack, pair both, then place the left back into the pack. Then the right earpod will beep at you for about 30 seconds while it’s trying to repair with the left pod until it gives up.

I’ve had some issues of the sound going in and out while only listening to the right earpod.

I can’t speak to battery. Seems fine.

I think 50 bucks is too much for these. Not really sure I’m going to keep them or not. They’re def. a hassle for the way I want to use them but for everyday, pop in, listen to music, pop out, they are fine.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good Enough to Game with!!!,"I've been through an array of wireless headphones for couch gaming and movies and had lag issues with Bluetooth (even Sony and Skull Candy) and cut outs with Turtle Beach (proprietary dual-band) to the point where I now have USB extensions run like speaker wires in the room for good USB gaming headphones while on the couch.
So I bought these for podcasts/audio books @ work and was so impressed with the bass I stared using them for music and then even tried them for gaming! While no wireless I've ever tried beats wired solutions I was truly impressed especially for this price point!
When I don't have to use headphones I like it loud enough to shake the walls and had absolutely no expectation from earbuds other than loud enough to hear while working out or mowing the lawn - these are blowing me away.

(like all BT-still has ever so slight lag but sooo much improved from a couple years ago)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really good for exercising,"I waited for a month before writing a review. Overall, very, very good. Battery life is plenty long. Unlike the another brand of white pods, these don’t fall out of my ear. The plug type pod gives really good passive noise reduction enabling you to hear your music even in noisy environments (including airplanes). As others have noted, from time to time the left pod will lose connection, albeit only very briefly and then it restores on its own.
I’m definitely not an audiophile, so I have no comment about the quality of the sound.

they stick out a bit for someone who has small ear canals and a large outer ear.,"I've only had it for one day, but the only problem I have with it is based on the immediate application of the product; putting it on. Took me awhile trying each size of ear tips twice to find the best fitting one which was the smallest one. I have small ear canals yet the outside part of my ear (excuse me for my lack of anatomy regarding the ear) and my lobes are large so the earbuds just jut out awkwardly and I am not one who likes to draw attention so I'm debating on whether to return them or not if I cannot find a way to wear them more discretely. However, for those who have normal ears, this product is worth it.

Edit: They fall out far too much for comfort for me. The noise cancellation helps when using public transportation but doesn't mean much when they slip out every few minutes even when sitting still",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Bad audio quality, possible email farming for spam","Not a fan of these headphones. The audio quality is far below what I would expect from $30 headphones much less at $50. The charging is case is bulky and not easily pocketable. There is a lot of phantom drain from the headphones which means you have to keep charging them even if you don’t use them. It’s also impossible to just use one without the annoying beeping that keeps overriding the music.

Additionally, registering warranty may have resulted in email spam. I have not given one of my email addresses anywhere, but after registering my warranty, I started receiving a lot of spam.

Overall, I wish I didn’t get these headphones. There are far better options out there especially at this price range. Go with a reputable brand like Anker. At least they support and stand behind their products. Be wary of all of the positive reviews for the product.

"Nice earbuds, very clear audio.","I really like the headphones.  They sound good and fit my ears well. The only negative for me is the poor outgoing audio for phone calls.  My friend said the earbud's mic made my voice fuzzy/cloudy/veiled.  Since using these for phone calls is a low priority for me, I only dock the rating by one star.  On the plus side, dictation via Siri worked fine.

While reading reviews I noticed some misinformation, so here's some info from the product manual.
-Earbud battery capacity is 55mAh/3.7V *2, which I assumes means 55mAh per earbud.
-Earbud storage/charging box capacity is 600mAh/3.7V, which is enough to charge two earbuds 4 times.
-Music play time is about 3 hours.
-Phone call time is about 5 hours.
-Fast charging: 20 minutes of charging can provide 1 hour of music playback.

I really like these, they sound good and come with 4 different size ear caps so you can customize them to better fit your ear size.  I listen to a lot of Audible audio books and these make the reader's voice come through very clearly, better than many full size bluetooth headphones that I've owned.  I have not tried the Apple bluetooth earbuds so I can't compare these to them, but nevertheless I am very happy with them.

The noise reduction is very good... However, as I approach the end of my exercise and my ear gets sweaty, there is a slight shift of the device in my ear... very slight... It got better when I replaced the earbuds with a smaller size! I really love it.  The charger case makes life easy, plus it pairs immediately with my mobile device! I would recommend this to anyone one who needs good earbuds for exercise!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Holy sound!,"These are my first pair of truly wireless ear buds and I was literally blown away. I put  them in while they paired to my phone, and jumped when they connected and came on. The sound was awesome. They fit nice and snug and have stayed in great working out. I do burpees with them in, can run, and so my cross trainer. Definitely recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Keeps disconnecting,"I really like the sound of the buds, nice bass!  They work great when just listening to music.  But when I try to use them with my IPhone 11, they keep disconnecting.  I am only using the right bud when using it for the phone, so I am not sure if that is why.  But, I can be talking, then I get... ""disconnected, reconnecting, connected"".  And this happens every 30 seconds to a minute.  Just got the new Iphone, so now the return period has passed, I guess I'm SOL!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound At A Great Price,"Great sound quality for a great price. Only reason I rated a 4 star is because I have not figured out how to control volume when using it with my 4K Firestick watching TV. Seems I have no control of volume. That may be on me and open to any suggestions someone may have.  Level that comes out however is comfortable. Other than that works great with my phone and Nexus 7 pad. Volume level is controllable and quality is much better than cheap pair I had previously purchased and as good as very expensive pair I had tried. Storage/charging box is very convenient and takes away any anxiety one may have as far as using for a long time. Charges very fast , both ear buds and charging box. Charged case to full when I received it and still at full after a day. Buy them, you'll be glad you did.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Definitely recommend!,Buds arrived late and I almost returned since I specifically purchased for my international travel schedule. I decided to try and immediately loved these. The souls is crisp and clear. I virtually hear no noise. These are perfect and very easy to operate. I use while working out. I get lost in whatever I am listening to which makes working out less painful! (It’s bee a while!) I definitely recommend this product!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The negative reviews can easily become positive...,"The first pair I received had an issue where the left earbud kept disconnecting. I had a feeling this was just how it was designed. Cheap... $50 Bluetooth earbuds... you get what you pay for... I started to pack them back up to return. Instead of accepting it, I actually contacted the manufacturer.
They helped troubleshoot them, and it turned out to be a defective pair. They sent out a new set and I am so glad that I decided to work with them.  They sent me out a fresh pair, and now they work great!

Take the time and size the ear tips correctly, and you’ll get good sound. I ordered a pair if Comply ear tips, so I am expecting even better sound isolation and quality.

I wear them in the shower. Due to my roommates schedule, I had to quit using my speaker.

I am so happy with the customer service I received!  The earbuds have been constantly used since I received them. In fact, I ordered a second pair to have in my car for when I go shopping.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Fantastic on a budget,"The earbuds are great, and the waterproofing is excellent. The sound quality is fantastic, and the case wirelessly charges, which is super cool.

Received them as a gift & love them!,"Received these as a gift from my hubby so I’ve only used them once so far.  They came with several sizes for the ear pieces, which was good because I needed the smallest ones.  Those were easy to change out.  Sound quality is great, I have my phone on the lowest volume setting and think they are plenty loud.  I can even hear the individual background instruments when listening to songs, sounds that I had never noticed before!  As I said, I’ve only worn them once as they were a gift, but so far so good!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worthwhile Investment. Love it!!!!!,"I received my earbuds last week. It looks and sounds great and very easy to pair. The Tozo T10 is compact and fits easily into my ears. This earbud has liberated me from wires and I can even listen to music and podcasts in one ear at work and use the other ear to receive phone calls.

My brother loves my T10 and is thinking of discarding his bulky old clunker for a T10. I highly recommend this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bang for you buck!,"Everything is great, but just for those who need in-depth information on how it sounds here it is (and I will be critical):

Highs are very weak. The mids and bass are chokingly loud compared to highs, which might be an attractive option for you bass heads out there. But, don't expect much clarity in music. I am guessing due to waterproofing, many high frequencies are getting lost.

Mids are very prominent, really too loud making it sound a bit like an old radio (in terms of vocals and background track), but this is easily overcompensated by the fact that the bass in these headphones is insane.

Bass, now the low frequencies on these bad boys are extremely loud, but with no clarity. As loud as it is, I can hear small distortions as well as muddiness in the bass. It almost sounds like the bass has reverb on it, but it shouldn't.

With the price in mind, honestly great wireless headphones. Setting up is simple, sounds great for the price range. It might be a bit hard figuring out how to plug them in your ears without it falling off, but it is great for working out in as well as just everyday use.  Waterproofing is always a nice addition for working in moist conditions.

After using:

Transitioning from Sennheiser HD 598 SR, these earphones sounded just all right. After adjusting to it, I am no longer annoyed by the lack of highs or strong presence of mids. Still, the bass is too overwhelming, and especially playing video games it lowers the audio awareness due to an incredible amount of bass muddying up game sounds. I had to lower the bass on my phone as well as on PC just so I can hear anything with better clarity, which did increase the sound quality quite a lot. Either way, a great budget option for those bass heads out there but not so much for those who prefer balanced audio.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds good but didn't fit,"They sound great, but no matter what I do (switched to the small attachment) they don't fit in my ear well. I gave them to my daughter to try and she couldn't wear them either (they practically fall out). Perhaps we have little ears.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
PLEASE TRY-YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!,"I tried these earbuds to replace the Samsung buds I just purchased.  I was very unhappy with the Samsung product and the cost was more than double.  Well, I am so happy that I did.  The Tozo T10's are exactly as advertised..the sound is clear..no problems with the connection..all of the features of the Samsung..BUT the best part of this purchase is.....I had a few questions but realized there was no phone number to call so I emailed their customer service.  I heard a reply within hours!!!  A second email made after hours was answered first thing in the morning.  They could not have been more accommodating.

"Good range, charging adapter is great","These ear buds were super easy to connect and have really good sound quality. There are several size ear pieces you can easily switch out to ensure they don't fall out while you're running. The range is pretty good, it didn't start breaking up until I was at least 50 or 60 feet away from my phone. I already had a wireless charging pad for my phone and the charging adapter works perfectly with it. Great to recharge the adapter every couple days and recharge the headphones everytime you take them out of your ears.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A MUST buy for anyone who loves music!!!,The sound quality is amazing!!!  Truly a bargain for the cost of these earbuds.  They hold a charge for a really long time and they don't fall out while working out like other wireless earbuds.  These are great all around AND waterproof!!! They're fantastic; you definitely can't go wrong with these earbuds!!!  Did I mention how comfortable they are?  I wore them for a couple hours without any discomfort in my ears.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left headphone plays on and off,"Sound quality is relatively good. I have always had a problem with the left (slave) ear cutting in and out. Then it will play for a period at a much lower volume then the right. Other times it just stops playing, then surprises you by tripping in every now and then.

If the left ear would play consistently, I would be a happy customer. There are no issues with the right side. It connects via Bluetooth and plays until I turn if off.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product.  Just what I needed.  So I thought,"I received my headset a few days ago.  I liked the sound, the weight and comfort of the headset but people couldn't hear me. So, I called Amazon customer service and they told me to keep the defective headset and sent me another one which I received today.  The previous set was defective.  The replacement set works great and operates seamlessly for listening to music and making or receiving calls.  I have them on listening to music while working at home and when a call comes in, I click the button on either side and I'm on the phone.  I highly recommend this set.  Don't give up on this set.  Apparently the manufacturer does not have a good quality testing program based on the reviews.  I'm glad I stuck with this set and didn't return them.
UPDATE of my review:  I received the replacement headsets yesterday and still have the same issue. Returned to Amazon for full refund.  They only asked for one set back.  The set that I still have will make a good Bluetooth headphone.  I will buy a cheap headset this time since my Plantronics that cost as much as this one switches back and fort to the phone in the middle of the call. I give this thing a one star review for having wasted my time.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bad mic and left earbud looses connection,"For $50 I would expect more from these headphones.  This is my first set of wireless earbuds so maybe my expectations are too high, but I wouldn't recommend paying $50 for these.
The Bad:
1) Everyone complains about the mic quality when I use them during phone calls.  So I've all but given up using these for phone calls
2) The left earphone cuts out frequently.  I'll be listening to music and for a second or two, I won't be able to hear anything out of the left earbud.
3) Battery dies out quickly.  Batter seems to die out quickly.  Maybe it's just my expectations are too high, so I'm not really holding this against them.

Neutral:
1) Sound quality seems okay (when it's not cutting off - but that's more of a connection issue and not a sound quality issue).

Good:
1) I like the charging deck.  The charging deck has an internal battery so you don't have to have it constantly plugged into the wall.  Very helpful when traveling.

All and All, I would say these are a decent $20 pair of headphone.  But for $50, I would expect much more and they don't deliver.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earphones I've ever owned,"Pretty much the best earphones I've ever owned. I bought them on a lightning deal when a friend recommended them and I'm still extremely surprised about the quality of the earphones for the price.

TOZO 10 Experience,"I was in the market for bluetooth earbuds and decided to give these a chance after reading so many positive reviews about the sound quality. I have to admit, I initially purchased the Pasonomi iXP7 rated bluetooth earbuds, but I just needed a better experience in terms of sound quality. I'm not sure about others, but these are the earbuds for music enthusiasts. If you enjoy listening to music while being fully engaged in sporting activities, then these are for you. The sound quality is as good as one could hope for, I love listening to music with deep bass and these exceeded my expectations and delivered where the Pasonomi earbuds could not for me [(but it did for my wife :-)]. The sound quality is amazing, crystal clear, and I haven't experienced any issues with battery life in the four weeks that I've been using my TOZO earbuds. The one opportunity for improvement would be having the ability to switch  tracks/ adjust volume directly through the device; however, for me the sound quality makes it worth it for me!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great for music, terrible for phone calls","UPDATE: Turns out these earbuds sound fine, but they're terrible for making phone calls. Every time I call someone with them, they say they can barely hear me, like the sound is very muffled. I guess maybe that's because of the waterproofing? Anyway, deducting 2 stars due to very bad call quality. If you're only using these to listen to music, they still work fine for that. Below is my original review.

I've been very happy with these earbuds. They sound good and the battery seems to last about as long as advertised. I usually wear one in my ear with the other in the charging case, then swap them when the battery gets low and they easily last all day switching between them like that. The Qi charging feature of the case is pretty cool too.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The sound is still great but unfortunately if I get a call I have to take out the earbud because the caller can not hear me clearly. They describe it as sounding under water or having the mic covered. This gets pretty annoying especially when I'm cooking or have my hands full and can't grab my phone to disconnect the Bluetooth. Music still plays really well and blocks out all noise if both are in.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for the price,"I've been looking for true wireless headphones that were good quality, provided a good amount of bass, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. Thankfully I found these bad boys and not only were they way cheaper than most wireless headphones, they actually gave you a great amount of bass. The fact that they were water resistent and that the case had wireless charging was a huge bonus. Alss I've watched some review videos and people complained about the earbuds don't pair right away when you take them out of the case. I haven't had any issue with this, once I paired them they always automatically paired up once I take them out. I've had them for about a month now and haven't noticed any problems so far.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really impressed with the sound quality and how easy they operate!,"I was hesitant to go bluetooth, but since many of the major smartphone manufacturers have abandoned headphone jacks I guess it became inevitable.

I really didn't want something else to charge, but the case makes it easy.  The headphone turn off and start charging as soon as you put them back in the case.

The sound quality is top notch.

They include 4 different sized earbud adapters to find the perfect fit.  I had a corded headset before that had three and I had not idea my fit was not great.  This in between option is incredible.  It blocks so much more noise and allows for better listening at lower volume.

Go ahead and get them, you will be happy you did.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bluetooth connection drops out a lot,"Fine earbuds, sound is good. Biggest issue for me is that these really are only good if you phone is in direct line of sight of the earbuds, as the smallest obstruction will block the bluetooth signal. As soon as my phone is in my pocket, it will drop in and out repeatedly to the point of being annoying and useless. I don't have this probelm with other bluetooth headphones .  Perfect if you want to put your phone on a treadmll in front of you, but otherwise pretty disappointed. I will have minimal use for these.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfortable and they sound GREAT!,I was looking for some decent wireless earbuds and came across these. After reading the reviews I decided to give them a try and I'm very happy I did.

So far So good!,"Really impressed with these so far. I am an avid gym goer and really prefer the earbud for working out. No wires is just such a perk when it comes to all the movement I'm doing.

So far the sound is really good, does a decent job of cancelling. The fit is a bit weird with it..i'm still getting used to it, but still solid.

battery has been good so far. This is a big part of earbuds for me. i've had a pair before and battery life completely evaporated and ended up only lasting for maybe a hour before needing recharging. I will keep an eye I've only had these for few days, but so far it's held up very well.

Overall I think these are excellent for the price. The customer support has been fantastic as well and checked in with me right away asking about my purchase and thoughts. I really appreciate it when sellers actually care about their customers.

Fantastic Sound,"I'm really impressed with these ear buds. I got a pair for my mom for her birthday and she loved them so much that I got them for myself. The bass is really impressive. I barely have to turn the volume up to hear clear sound and I feel like I'm hearing some intense bass but it's just in my head. Well balanced sound imo.
A big selling point for me was noise cancelling and these excel at that. I'm dead to the world with them on. No screaming kids on the airplane. The included charger is really solid. They didn't cut corners. It's got a magnetized lid (not snapped) and the ear bud pop right into place with the magnet. It also comes charged which is really thoughtful.
I have really tiny ear canals and the smalls mostly fit in. I don't feel like they are sticking out from my ears. If they ever made a kids size I would be on board, but it's not their fault at all. They have four total sizes instead of three which is also impressive.
Overall this was really worth it especially for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really Great Earbuds when they work. My left earbud is dead after 5 months.,"****Update. The left earbud has stopped working. It won't pair with the right earbud and the voice prompts are slowed? It's weird. Anyway disappointing as these weren't ""that"" cheap. They should last longer. I hope there is a warranty....

I really love these. I bought them so I could listen to podcasts in the shower and not bug everyone with a shower radio.  Sound quality is great. No connection issues whatsoever. The only and I mean only flaw really is that wearing them in the shower....as soon as you get a little water in your ear area, they loose grip and start to come out.

Garbage. Do not buy.,"For $40, I did not expect these earbuds to be top of the line. I did, however, expect them to work properly.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt for a few weeks; silly me because now the return window is closed. Here is a short list of problems:
-Constant popping noises
-Audio is persistently out of sync between earpieces or cutting out completely
-The microphone is spotty at best; I would need to shout for the person on the other end of the phone call to hear me

Good 90% of the time,"The sound on these is very nice for bluetooth, and the earbuds fit comfortably and securely. I use these on my bike rides and have no issue with them coming loose. The problem is that the connection will drop on and off, sometimes dozens if not hundreds of times during a ride (over a time of an hour or two). Overall this only adds up to a few minutes of dropped time total since each drop is only for a few seconds. I haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it. It seems to sometimes coincide with my leg movement (in my pocket as I'm biking) but I don't think that would matter for a bluetooth connection. I don't know if it's my phone, or the earbuds, but I suspect the latter because other people have had similar issues and because if I use my phone's bluetooth in my car I never experience any similar drops. This isn't a huge deal; it's only a few seconds at a time. Still, it can sometimes be very annoying if I'm trying to enjoy a song or listening to a podcast or whatever it may be.

Battery life has been significantly greater than expected.  For reference, I wore these on a 4 hour flight and upon re-docking they showed a 3/4 battery life left.

Horrible product...,"The sound quality I think is great for the price. Not bad. Just couple inconveniences for me like not automatically connecting to my bluetooth phone when taken out of the case. One major thing that bothers me is that instead of a slight touch to pause/play music... you have to CLICK. And while the ear piece is in my ear, I have to press the button really hard for it to actually click and by the time it actually clicks... it digs into your ear and is slightly painful. So i have to hold the earpiece with my thumb and middle finger to try to press down hard enough w my index finger.

Updated review: less thanb2 months have gone by and the earphones are already acting up. If you want to use only one earpiece... that one earpiece will beep every 2 secs trying to search for the other earpiece. So if you wanna use one piece. You have to pull both earpieces out of the case and leave one in your pocket or something.
Frequently, the music will quite down almost as if I got a notification on my phone but when I check. Nothing. The music also pauses randomly for some reason.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them!,"I love this earphones.  Working alone and with no stimulation, time becomes dull.  I was listening to some audiobooks, but at times, the noise of moving boxes around the freezer was shutingoff the serene voice coming out of the smartphone.  Then I was observing that my younger coworkers had some white device in their ears.  They told me that cost them $170!
Well, I searched for wireless earphones in my favorite omnichannel:Amazon.  I saw the reviews.  And I have to say that I saw the bad reviews.  Before ordering I read one review about the earphones not working... but the customer service was great...  I guess that made me decide to order them.

Well worth the reasonable price!,"Device is intuitive, easy to use and stylish. I am very impressed by the functionality--easy pairing of l/r and to my devices--and obvious quality of the manufacture. There are times when the left channel drops out/phases, but I use the buds during physical activity and don't see that as a huge issue: just the way BlueTooth rolls.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works somewhat decent.,"They sound pretty good to me, BUT, they cut out often. I use these at the gym and I'm there for about an hour and a half usually and they always cut out at least once. And the battery life on the case is horrible. Lasts about 2 days MAYBE. If you leave them fully charged for a few days and come back to them, the buds and the case are both dead. Sad.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent sound, efficient customer service","I've had the TOZO 10 earbuds a few days now, and am astonished at how good the sound is for bluetooth earbuds.  It's almost as if the sound is being generated in the center of my head, it's that kind of ""surround sound"" sensation.  Also, really mutes out outside noises, so great for concentration in noisy environments (haven't had them on a plane yet, but expect they would excel in that application).  Finally, had a small glitch getting them to connect automatically to my iPhone 10, and customer support was prompt and efficiently solved the problem, so kudos there, as well.  --Andrew",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great out of the box,For the price I wasn’t expecting much but I was actually blown away by the sound quality. They may not pair as easily as maybe AirPods but for a third of the price of them they are great! Would recommend if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative than buying these name brand wireless earbuds. The only issue I had was finding the right earbud size the shipped size fit ok but the size above hurt my head so there wasn’t a perfect fit but they would only fall out if the was shaking my head vigorously.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Reasonable price for great quality earbuds,My daughter is very pleased with these earbuds. Says the quality of sound is very good and she loves the wireless feature.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I’ll keep looking.,"I liked the fact that with the rubber on the earpiece I was able to screw it into my ear for a secure fit. But this tight fit blocked out too much of the world around me and people I was talking to did not like the sound and we’re always saying are you on a speaker phone, could you turn it off because I can barely hear you.
Also the battery life was often less than 8 hours.
I also only use one device.
In short another moderately priced Bluetooth and I’ll keep looking.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Earbuds I have purchased,"Being a softball player and an avid gym rat I have gone through a number of different earbuds and headphones.  My son purchased the a similar product and after trying his I was sold.  I have only had the TOZO 10's for a short time but I would recommend them to anyone.  For the money, they have been a solid investment and the best pair of earbuds I have owned to date.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
7/10 Good but could have been great,"Pros:
-When you pop them in your ear, they tell you which is the right and left channel in case you put them on wrong. Love this.
-Sound quality is much better than expected for something their size. Crisp clean sound. Comparable to my wired sony earbuds.
-wireless charging, Love it.
-pairing is super easy and I love that I can listen to spotify from my phone on my earbuds, get in my car, put the earbuds in the charger, and my phone just goes to my car bluetooth, no buttons needed, super easy.
-Decent range. I can be anywhere in my 1 bedroom apartment and I don't lose range.
-The magnetic ""click"" when you put the earbuds in their case. So satisfying.
-sturdy design, both of the earbuds and the charger
-waterproof IPX8.

Neutral:
3.5 hours continuous battery life and 9 more hours with charging. Some competitors are offering 5 hours continuous for those long hikes.

Cons:
-No navigation functions other than pause?? They should have at least made double-clicking one of the buds the skip function, but instead, for some reason decided to make it a redial function on both earbuds...
-The mic might as well not be there at all. whenever I try making calls with it, people complain that they can barely hear me and it just fades in and out. Reading other reviews, it sounds like I'm not alone.
-When I am using the earbuds with my phone and I put my phone in my pocket, the sound quality will be choppy for a second or 2 like I'm going out of range but quickly go back to normal.

Conclusion:
My intent was to use these as a replacement from my $25 Sony wired earbuds with mic. As a listening device goes, the sound quality and wireless capability are big plusses, But the wired Sony earbuds have a mic I can actually use for calling out with no complaints and unlike TOZOs, the Sony wired buds have a button on the mic that I can use for single-press pause AND double-press skip.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My first pair of bluetooth earbuds!,"These are a great, affordable pair of bluetooth earbuds. I use them while swimming at the gym, and I have had an overall great experience with them. They stay in my ear quite well, and the bluetooth range covers the entire pool as far as I can tell. The portable charger is a nice feature, though I haven't found out yet if there is a way to stop the charging (aside from taking the earbuds out). You'll want to charge the whole apparatus regularly, like a cell phone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good music sound, but poor on call quality",Not good at all on using for phone calls.  Gets background noise and poor quality for the person on the other end to hear you.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor sound for the money,"First off, the plugs do not stay in ears. I am constantly redirecting the ear buds, very aggrivating. Never used them in water so I cannot comment. Now, the crux. The sound is decent. But not up to ""par"" with the coast and description. You can find less expensive ones that sound better on this website. The music sounds blurred. Not defined and way too heavy on the bass. Mid and highs I could never fully grasp. Well, that's it kiddies. I would have returned the darn things but just now seeing I missed the return date, but all, that's on me. But, the impetus for this review. It is ""Fair"" and accurate, with no embellishments.

Best Bluetooth Earphone Out there!,"My personal tips for people who's struggling:
1. Use various sizes of earbuds to find what's a good fit for you. Spend good amount of time to find it because it is important for your future use.
2. If you can't pair left earphones, try turning it on and off by pressing the button till you hear ""power off""
You will hear ""Connected"" followed by ""Right channel"" & ""Left channel""
Be sure to connect your device to TOZO-t10-R not L because Right earphone is the hub.

I don't prefer using Bluetooth earphones/headphones because it is usually uncomfortable, sound quality isn't good as plug-in earphones, and more importantly, it always falls off when I work out or play basketball. I tried out Airpods, but, yeah, as always, it falls off when I play basketball.
Tried this because I wanted to listen to music when I work out and it was AMAZING. At first I was skeptical and was ready to refund if it is a mediocre Bluetooth earphone. Although I bought it only for workout uses, as I wear it daily now because it is the most comfortable earphones I've ever used. Don't fall off easily and the sound quality is surpirsingly good. Sometimes I don't feel earphones in my ear, so it feels like I have a background music just like a main character in a movie.
100% would recommend if you are looking for a good workout or daily usage Bluetooth earphone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Heavy and uncomfortable, can't hear yourself talk.","They are heavy and don't stick will in my ear. Sound quality is just okay. You can't hear yourself through the earplugs while on the phone, so it's hard tk hear yourself talk. They don't seen too have noise canceling technology, more like they just plug your ears. I'd recommend getting something else.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Battery life is sketchy, sound quality is meh, and noise cancelling is unnoticeable.","I use these most everywhere.. As a normal earbud, they are fine. Nothing bad, not great. A bit pricey for not much low end. I notice the lack of performance in the gym and on my motorcycle. They fall out easily in the gym and the speaker 'shorts' or crackles when when sweating, and eventually stops working after about 15 minutes. This is with trying all of the different sized, silicon 'buds' to get the best fit. On the motorcycle, wearing a helmet, they work fine for music and I can even make calls. Noise cancelling does not work well, though. For the $49.99, I would expect a more robust, better performing product. Battery life is intermittent from 2-4 hrs. Not as much as expected or advertised.

UPDATE:  Seller has contact me and said I may have defective product. Offered to replace. Nice move. Hopefully, I just got a bum product and the replacement will be better.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value for the Price,"For the price of these headphones being around $50, you get a lot of  features. Unlike another pair of similar headphones I bought, they do not have connection issues between the two headphones when out walking, and the distance to the main bluetooth device can also be quite far. I really like the waterproofing, a great thing to be able to use them without worries of damages. The case that they charge in is really solid as well, and the wireless charging in it can also be very convenient.

The shape of the headphones is slightly bulky, or I guess larger than similar headphones, but the bass response on these headphones is good. Audio quality in general is quite good, not balanced or perfect, but great for the price. Also the shape of the tips included cover a good range of ear sizes, and different tips can also be used and fit in the case, as the hole for the headphones is quite large.

Overall I have just a few complaints, which are not a big deal at the price you get these. The battery charge of the case seems to be slightly incorrect, not sure what could cause that. The other main complaint is that the right headphone is slightly louder than the left in my pair, probably not noticeable to most, but it is slightly distracting to me. I give these headphones a 4.5/5 overall, hard to beat the features at this price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound.  Long battery life.,"I've only had these earbuds for 4 days but so far I love them. They're working as expected and the sound quality is amazing.  They paired to each other right away and to both my phone and my laptop, buy only one at a time.  I was a little disappointed that it could not pair to 2 devices at once, like my old LG headset. Battery life at first seemed to be quite short but on the 2nd day it was amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not backward compatible,"Bluetooth 5.0 apparently not backward compatible with 4.2 ... at least not on the Samsung S7.

Had to return them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pleasantly surprised!!,"My expectations were low based on the price, but these sound much much better than anticipated. Pairing was a no-brainer on my iPhone, and I've had no connectivity issues during use. The longest I've used them so far is 2 hrs. so I can't speak to the battery life. I found that the frequency response can easily be adjusted by just maneuvering them a bit while in use. Based on the bang for the buck I recommend.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor Sound and Connection,"I bought these as an addition to my existing collection of Bluetooth headsets because it had a wireless charging option. In comparison to my current and most used Bluetooth headphones, these TOZO's have poor audio quality and have a disturbing delay between video and sound. This delay does not exist on my current headphones so it must be specific to TOZOs electronics. Also, the right and left earpiece randomly pair with each other while I'm listening to some audio source which is just strange. I might have kept these if they were under $20 and all I would use them for is audio books. But the $50 price tag certainly doesn't justify keeping them given their sound and processing quality.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
There okay but wouldn't recommend these.,I purchased these earbuds so I could retire my powerbeats 3 while working out. My beats still work but I wanted some earbuds without any wires. I purchased these because of the price and the five star reviews.  I am kind of disappointed with these. My major problem with these earbuds is the fact that the right earbud has a lower volume when compared to the left one. For some reason the left earbud sounds normal while the right one barely can be heard. I looked through reviews and the questions section and found others are having this problem as well. I found that by tapping/hitting the top of the right earbud makes the sound match the left ear bud. After hitting/tapping the earbud they start to work as intended until you turn them off and turn them back on again.  I think these are good but I wouldn't recommend them.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Spend your money on better quality headphones,"They do not cancel noise at all, so if that's what you're looking for, don't buy them. They also frequently lose connection with the device I'm listening to, forcing me to stop what I'm doing and manually reconnect.

A great set of Earbuds. Amazing sound quality.,"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I’ve had numerous pairs of over the ear wireless earphones as well as wire ear buds.  I must say I’m extremely happy with this purchase. The ear buds arrived in one day. They were already charged and ready to go. They paired with my cell phone with no problems. I also paired them with my ipad. Because you can have two devices paired at the same time, I’m able to play music from my ipad while monitoring my phone as well.  I find the overall sound quality to be very clear and the bass is amazing. The range of the Bluetooth is excellent. I am able to walk around my home without the ipad and not loose the signal nor hear any degrading of the sound quality. I love the fact that the case pulls the earbuds in and locks them in place magnetically ensuring good contact while charging. There are 4 lights to show you the status of the charge/charging. The case is compact and easily fits in a pocket.  The earbuds have red lights to indicate they are charging and are out when fully charged. You can see these lights through the case top so no need to open it to check status.
These are very high quality wireless earbuds that are well worth the money. I highly recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best earbuds for me thus far!!!,"I had been looking for new earbuds after my previous ones had started to give me issues and then got misplaced, and I had considered just caving to the peer pressure and getting the apple airpods. Let me say, I am glad I found these, they are IMO just as good as the apple ones but at a fraction of the price, plus I am a fan how they fit in my ear, and I don’t have something dangling from the bottom of my ear. Call quality is pretty good too. Only real complaint is that it takes just a little over 10 seconds for the left bud to sync and connect to the right when I first take them out of their changing case, but that’s just a minor irritation. Would recommend these to my friends.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They don't fall out!,"My whole life I wish and tried to be able to use Iphone headphones and they just would not stay in my ears. These headphones do not fall out. Not in the gym, not at work, not cleaning, not sweating at the pool, they just don't fall out. Phone calls on them work great, super easy to set up with any device, they're just so convenient. No regrets buying these at all. The case they came in is a good size and lights up with how much battery is left on it. The 4 different sized ear buds that came with it are great too. I'm definitely going to get the flat charger for it though because using the cord is kinda of irritating but not impossible.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

On AirPods from Apple. Self recommend these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product! A few things to watch for,"Overall, this is a great product for its price. The major issue is that its design of the buds really allows them to fall out of your ears. They are water resistant, but the water doesn't really help with this issue. The other is that it goes a bit crazy when it's connecting to a device, notifying you about 4 different times before fully connecting. The last issue with the device is the battery life is short.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A must buy,"This are a muy buy, been trying many different brands of ear buds with little satisfaction. I received these and the minute I turned them on, I was hooked. I love the many different sizes of ear caps. I have very small ears and the smallest size fits perfectly. The sounds is also fantastic,  when I'm wearing the ear buds. I love that they are wireless and begin to pair with my phone as soon as I take them out of the base. Also the confirmation that both sides have been connected leaves out any doubt. Phone calls are easy to answer and very clear. The carrying case is very durable and the small size makes it easy to slip into a bag or pocket for on-the-go. The shipping box and packaging are also very impressive. Also, they were charged when I received them so I could use them right away. I have to say again how pleased I am with the different sized ear caps.. Probably my favorite feature. They don't fall out of my hears and I don't have to shove them in & hurt my ear.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Avoid this.,"The left bud frequently, and I mean all the time, cuts out or gets static.  It is worthless.  I just use the right one.  You get what you pay for.  Avoid this product.  You are NOT going to get what you expect or paid for.  When it works, which is completely random, its decent, but it rarely works correctly.  Just spend the extra $20-$30 to get something worthwhile.

Great quality/sound for the price!,"These earbuds are great, especially for the price you pay. Can't complain much. The sound quality is amazing, lots of bass and definitely cancels out the noise. They're great for going on a run because they don't fall out. The only down side to them is that they are a little too big for my ears so they stick out a little more than I'd like and don't fit 100% to my liking. I guess I just have really small ears? However, I reached out to the seller and they offered to send me smaller earcaps which was very nice of them.

Good quality earbuds,"I had been looking for a good looking and good quality earbuds. So far, the performance is great. Bluetooth connectivity, size, material quality, color, and battery life are so much better than any other in the market.

They don't stay in your ear at all.,"Took a chance on these headphones, and they aren't bad. The big issue is they just don't stay in your ear very well at all. I have tried the different rubber ear pieces that come with the headphones but none of them seem to work.

I was really hoping I’d be able to give them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️...,"So, I’ve had these Bluetooth “waterproof” headphones for less than 1 week. My initial opinion was a positive one...once I figured out how to fit them properly they worked great! The volume capacity, bass, noise cancellation and overall sound quality was awesome! I got 48 hours worth of enjoyment before I finally put them to the real test (the main reason I purchased them): wearing them in the shower. I’m one of those people who like to listen to music loudly while I shower. My roommate doesn’t mind the sound of my singing, but apparently the bass is more than a little distracting. So for the first 10 minutes of the shower, they worked just as well as they had in dry conditions. But when it came time to wash my face, I decided to take them out because I figured they’d probably fall out in the process. I set them up on a shelf in the shower, literally the furthest away from the shower head as you can get. After washing my face the earbuds wouldn’t stay put in my ears. I guessed it had something to do with my ears being dry when I’d first put them in and had them stay successfully. Upon stepping out of the shower the first thing I did was wrap them in paper towels cuz I figured they’d need to dry. I then put them back in their case to charge and didn’t attempt to use them again for several hours. That’s when I discovered that the left one had stopped working. Completely. It will blink it’s light while in the case, but as soon as I take it out it’s totally unresponsive. The right one still seems to work, but I didn’t spend $50 for 1 working waterproof earbud. And I haven’t showered with that one because I’m afraid it’ll die too. I purchased the recommended extended warranty at the same time, I’m hoping they’ll get me a pair that will work consistently.

So I started thinking they BOUGHT their reviews!  Anyway, trying to be optimistic, I went on a walk yesterday with my new ear buds and they sounded like crap.  No base at all.  Sounds tinny and they kept disconnecting.  I have since returned them this morning.  Pisses me off that companies try and buy reviews!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unbeatable price!,"Purchased these wireless earbuds because I refused to pay a ridiculous $200 for Apple earbuds. Quality and sound is great! What I love about this product is that you can wear any earrings as the buds don’t get in the way, unlike many wireless headphones on the market. In the package you receive different size ear buds to match your ear size, which is brilliant. I highly recommend this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality earbuds at a great price,"The Tozo T10 earbuds are high quality earbuds at a very reasonable price. The sound quality is rich and the bass is full, much better than my previous earbuds.  Wireless charging case is a great feature - the reason why I chose this over other models and I'm glad I did.
They fit pretty securely in my ears - I've run with them a few times and they haven't fallen out yet.
I like the fact that you can connect either earbud independently, so if you only want to use one (during calls or if you don't want to completely drown out the noise around you), you can. Speaking of which, if you have both earbuds in, they do an excellent job at blocking out noise.
The range is very good (30+ feet before signal cuts out). The Bluetooth 5.0 is a much better connection vs my old BT headset (after connection, my old headset would sound garbled for 30 seconds or so after connecting. And the connection would degrade when my phone was in my back pocket vs in front of my body - none of these issues with these earbuds)
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the call quality isn't great. When I'm using as hands free headset, the other party had a hard time hearing me. To be fair, this also happens a lot when I'm not using these earbuds with my pixel 3xl... But it seems to help when I use the phone vs the earbuds.
I highly recommend these earbuds, but there's a little room for improvement.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product for the Price,"I have tried various wireless headphones. Most recently had a pair from Costco that were over $100. They crapped out after less then a year and would not charge any more. I decided to start looking for a replacement and found these. I was a bit skeptical at first due to the price, but they had good reviews so I decided to give them a try. Turns out it was a good purchase. Great sound quality and battery life for the price. Charging case is small and very convenient. Pairing was easy and the battery life seems to be great. after a 1.5 hour work out they were still at 90%.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great quality sound,  ease of use, and affordable","I have many sets of Bluetooth earbuds, and my quest has always been to find a pair with good quality sound that holds up when I’m mowing my lawn on my riding mower, and that will not fall out of my ears while I’m working on the yard. The T10 is way better in terms of sound quality and fit than any I have previously purchased. I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I wore them. Easy to charge, easy to pair, and I love the bass with I’m listening to music (I’m a 60’s rock guy) I was hopeful when I ordered but given the price compared to ‘high end’ buds I didn’t expect greatness. In fact, these earbuds are better than my expensive Sony, Beats, and Bose earbuds that I have. Highly recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good for exercise,"If you stand still like a mime, the plugs won't fall out. Its a joke that there suppose to stay in. If it wasn't for use on my motorcycle helmut, I would have returned.

great buds. buy them. =),"i wear only 1 bud at a time, but it doesn't matter which one i use, i can listen to music, pod casts, talk on the phone, etc. the pair lasts me a few days before having to recharge the case and buds together. had it for over a month now and haven't lost one yet... a bit tricky sometimes when i do have to re-pair them with the phone (especially if i take both out first and want to only use the left bud after that), but all in all, long lasting and good quality buds, glad i made this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best headphones for Working out,"I am a heavy sweater and doing cardio with these headphones are a treat. IPX8 is well worth the cost.. No issues thus far, and holds a charge for way longer than I expected. The bass quality is very good for its purposes.
Also I have a hard time keeping headphones of this kind in my ear, but right out of the box the ear buds stayed in throughout a vigorous workout.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound,This little package packs a punch. Great sound with deep bass and easy connectivity right out of the case. I keep them charged frequently so I haven't run them to end of battery life but can say I am very satisfied with this purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
1st Time Wireless Earbud User and Very Satisfied,"I was tired of using corded earbuds because of their constantly getting caught on things and being yanked out as I was trying to work. Nothing worse than when you're in the middle of a project  (think doing the dishes, changing the oil in the car, mowing the lawn) and in the middle of a fave song when suddenly the shock when an earbud is caught on something and suddenly yanked out of your ear. Oh, the horror. Well, now I am much more free and able to do more with these particular wireless earbuds. They pair quickly, charge quickly, and the sounds quality is as good as my previous $30 earbuds but of course, these are wireless. Well worth the money and easy to use. This is my 1st Bluetooth anything and so I am looking forward to streaming with other devices. Tozo makes an excellent product, here. Highly recommend for your first or 2nd or 3rd wireless earbud purchase. Give them a try. I'm sure you'll be as satisfied as I am.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome on every aspect,"Just got them yesterday, so far so good I can literally go anywhere in my house and I can still hear the music perfectly. It skips for milliseconds when you first start them up and I have to manually pair it with my phone. But these are definitely worth the price!
***Update***
(3 weeks in)
The right ear bud falls out from time to time while I’m running they are super durable though. Sound still works perfectly, and the case always keeps them charged.
As for the case I am using a wireless charger for it and it works perfectly.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bang for your Buck!!,"I wasted a lot of money on other ear buds trying to find the best pair, well finally!! I've found them! Off the Bat I was excited about the quality and sturdiness of the product. Product was very well crafted. The noise cancelation was excellent Which allowed for better sound quality and enjoyment. There's just not enough words to explain all the good things about thiese ear buds all I can say is don't waste your money like I did on other products because of the price and don't be deterred by how affordable these are. This is definitely the best bang for your buck!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and value in a small package!,"For starters, these earbuds sound great!  Responsive low freqs and clear mods and highs. The volume is good, controlled by the device it’s paired to, not loud enough to noticeably distort or hurt your ears. Fit and feel is good, multiple ear tips will help you get it just right. Battery life is better than expected for such small pieces. I tend to use them one at a time while I’m at work so I can jam out while still being able to hear my coworkers, so one is always charged and ready to go. The finish is very stylish and clean and very well executed. The buds and charging case are sleek and user friendly. A better product at half the price than what you’ll find at big box retailers, try them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, wish there was more functionality","I have tried a lot of headphones and these have a great sound and fit tightly in the ear. In terms of controls, it is a bit hard to press the button when they are in your ear and I would like to have the ability to change the songs by touching the earbuds instead of doing it on my phone. Also, the play time is a bit disappointing considering similar earbuds have 5 hours of play time with the ability to change songs. The sound is excellent and the main reason to purchase these.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best value wireless earbuds,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Why can't the big named companies build as high quality at an economical price!,Nearly perfect! Sound quality is superb in such a small design. They fit comfortably in your ear and recharges in a case which can be charged wirelessly.  Battery life overall could be longer in a single charge but I've yet hit the max in a single use; typically placing back in the charger for safe keeping.  Extremely happy with my purchase!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy to use and good sound. Good customer service.,"I ordered this in June and had no problem setting up, charging and using.  It was very convenient and easy.  However, after about six weeks of use, the right ear bud would not pair with my phone.  I contacted TOZO and they quickly responded with a method to reset the earbuds.  I did as they instructed but the right bud still would no longer pair with my phone.  TOZO replied that this was a very unique situation and would replace both buds free of charge.  I was most impressed with the way the problem was handled and solved.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Will not keep pairing,"First set wouldn't charge.  Amazon sent me a second set (easy to deal with) and these won't hold pairing.  When they do work, they sound real good.  Maybe I just got two bad sets, but, I've resorted to my ""wired"" earbuds for now.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THESE ARE THE ONES!!!,"I got these for my birthday (which I had to buy to replace the vacuum my husband bought me...smh) and seriously these are fantastic!

Great sound quality and noise cancelling earphones for the price!,"I’ve been looking for a good set of earphones for me to be able to workout in without them getting in the way. So far I can not recommend these enough, especially for the price point! For reference I do mostly weight training and I boulder. While I weight trained they stayed in place. I’m glad they provided extra sizes for the ears. The sound quality is also exceptional! For the price, it is loud and has a good enough bass. I’ve worn these around the house and are also really good at noise cancelling. Will try to provide more updates as time goes on.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product and incredible customer service! Made my week! Love these earphones. Thanks Tozo!,"Wow. These earphones are by far the best on the market at their price point. Quality is great, bass is deep, fit is perfect, pairing is quick. They are light weight, charge ridiculously fast (I find charging just for 10 minutes can give you 30-40 minutes of extra play time). They are perfect for the office and the gym and everywhere in between. One of the most incredible things about this product and the company is the unmatched customer service. I had some issues pairing these that came up randomly. I was frustrated, so I reached out to Tozo. They immediately sent me a brand new pair for free and I didn't have to do a thing! They showed up in 2 days! Customer service is so helpful and friendly, it brought a huge smile to my face. Please consider these earphones! You won't regret it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Adequately perform the job needed for the price,"I really wanted to rate these 3/5 but given the poor experience I had with my last pair of bluetooth earbuds these were much better. The battery life is only a few hours but they charge quickly enough in the case. It feels just barely premium enough, the buds magnetically click into place satisfyingly. The pairing and sync experience isn't perfect, sometimes they'll need to be put back into their case and pulled out to ""reset"" them. One can be used by itself but will beep annoyingly looking for it's partner for a short amount of time (less than 2 minutes or so I guesstimate) after starting to use it.

Also, maybe I've got weird ears but I can never seem to get a good seal with earbuds and these are no exception.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Space Saver,"These are great. I love how lightweight they are. I don't like wearing headphone hook over my ear because I have to wear glasses, which makes my primary headphone uncomfortable to wear. These are a good alternative if you don't want to wear contacts to the gym all the time. Pairing is simple and the earbuds have a nice sound quality. The case for the earbuds doubles as an external battery that can recharge the earbuds up to fours times. Well worth $50. Get rid of your Bose and Beats. Downsize to these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Waterproof Buds For the Money!,"These are excellent buds and relatively inexpensive. I am often in the pool listening to music and got tired of replacing the much more expensive Bose buds that immediately failed if they accidentally dropped into the water. Problem solved by Tozo. They fit much better and don't stick out as much as the Bose version, which stuck out so much they made me look like Shrek! The waterproofing alone is worth the money. Sound quality is very good.

Great Product,"The TOZO T10 earbuds worked seamlessly and well out of the box.  I really like how comfortable they are and how well they fit.

Great product and great value!,"I am extremely happy with my new Tozo T10 ear buds! I have wanted a pair of ear buds for a while, but frankly was scared off by the $200 price tag of the units from the big boys, so I did a lot of research, and am very pleased with my choice. They are comfortable, with great sound quality, considering the value. The charger case is amazing, keeps the little buggers charged and ready at all times.

Great quality at such a low price!,So I misplaced my $160 Jabra earbuds so ordered these inexpensive ones until I located my other ones. Right out of the box I noticed the quality; much better than I expected. Then I paired them and tried out my music. I was confused...because they sounded THAT good!

"easy pairing, good sound quality","I have tried other bluetooth earbuds, and these are the easiest to pair most reliably.

Works great for a great price.,"I have only used them twice since buying them, but they sound great, they're easy to set up and they are indeed waterproof. There is no volume control and you cannot track back or forward without using your phone or a BT remote control (or at least there isn't anything about it in the user manual), but the overall sound quality and the fact they they are waterproof more than makes up for the lack of control. They also fit me great and are very lightweight compared to what I am used to (NuForce BE Free5).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You'll love these - with a small catch,"I am a non-paid reviewer, but was asked to review the product.

4.5 stars rounded up.

Why 4.5-Stars?
- Great sound.  Pretty damn great actually.  Rivals more expensive sets for sure.
- Light (for me), and they stay in my ears while I run/sweat.
- No issues with disconnection, though sometimes the audio will blip.  I don't know if this is due to poor LTE in some situations or if the headset is struggling to maintain connectivity.  It doesn't happen often.
- I haven't dunked myself in water with these on, but its nice to know they won't die due to that.
- The charging case is a generic thing that most manufacturers offer for this type of setup now, but this is a nice battery/charging case to boot.

Why not complete 5 Stars?
- Well, this isn't the manufacturers fault, but I should have looked harder at the specs.  It seems Bluetooth LL (Low Latency, or APTX LL) is not supported.  What that means is that extremely low latency applications (like gaming) utilize the generic Bluetooth protocol only.  This means that there can be a small lag in video to audio sync in SOME applications.  For instance, if you pair to a TV and listen/watch.

Overall, very happy.  Great build quality and great follow up by the TOZO team.  They obviously care.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Will stop working after 3-4 weeks.,These worked alright for about 3-4 weeks.  After that I noticed there were pairing issues that were not easily fixed.

"Good buds, bad connectivity","I'm writing this after about 2 weeks of us, primarily with a Samsung Galaxy S8.

The good
- Feel nice and solid
- Comfortable
- Solid sound
- Great battery life
- Wireless charging case is convenient

The bad
- Connectivity is spotty and cuts out often
- Case is bulky
- Not good for talking
- High pitched noises hurt.

I liked these at first blush. They feel premium and I enjoyed using them, but connectivity quickly became an issue. When turning my head certain ways, touching my ear (like scratching), or having my phone in different pockets, I noticed a lot of connectivity issues. Brief audio cuts have been common, and it can be so bad that things become unintelligible.

On the plus side, they do feel great and I enjoyed them a lot when they worked. It's possible my set has an issue, but as itsl stands, they're hard to recommend because of the audio cutting out.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bang for your Buck,"Honestly, you can't really go wrong with these wireless earbuds. The sound quality is great for the price, they fit snugly and comfortably (and the earpieces can be changed, so its bound to work with you) and the battery life is excellent. At times I'm forgetting I'm wearing anything and I've even fallen asleep with them without any worries about them being uncomfortable or falling out.

I've yet to find any problems with them regarding bluetooth pairing, though I must admit the buttons on them are somewhat mushy and not clicky enough for my taste. Likewise, I think the charging case is a bit bulky and might be uncomfortable to have in a pocket compared to other lightweight cases that are out there.

Overall, the quality matches the price quite aptly, one doesn't have to break the bank unlike with other bluetooth earbuds out there. If the little gripes I found with the product aren't a dealbreaker, I'd say these earbuds are well worth the purchase. Plus, you get a full year of warranty at no extra cost, which is always a nice touch.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quite low fidelity and not very compact. Disappointed,"As with most Bluetooth headphones they do not get very loud at all.

I decided to take a chance on the Tozo T10  because of the excellent reviews, as well as the sheer number of reviews. I was right to take the chance; they sound excellent, not much worse than my bose qc35. They key to getting good sound it to make sur they fit as deep in the ear as possible. They can be slept in, given you adjust to the right position. The only level of discomfort comes from them  the pressure of laying against them.

I also LOVE that you can charge the case and headphones at the same time on a wireless charger! So convenient!

One thing that I was not impressed with was there were some typos in the directions and occasionally the directions to get the earbuds synced to your device were a bit vague. My boyfriend is a wiz at figuring electronics out and he has them working in perfect order now!

They fit comfortably in my ears and I will use them to listen to religious podcasts in church whenever the pastor gives a wimpy sermon. :-)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound but not so good connection,"I was wanting so bad to love these but they just would not stay connected to each other or the phone. I returned them as a result of one continuously cutting out on more than one occasion.
The IP rating is what drew me to them and the sound was actually not bad I just couldn't continue to have my left side keep disconnecting.
If tozo fixed this issue I would recommend them. As of right now though I would not buy these they are a waste of money.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Randomly disconnecting when phone is in pocket and I'm working out,"These have amazing sound and good battery life, but the most important feature of bluetooth headphones is staying connected.  When my phone is stationary on a counter and I'm walking around a room I experience no problems whatsoever.  But when my phone is in my pocket the earbuds disconnect consistently making them unusable.  Really wish this wasn't an issue because I love everything else about these.  Sending them back :(

update:  Tozo sent me a second pair of these for free saying that they had fixed the connection issue.  Unfortunately it hadn't been fixed.  I'll reiterate the fact that these sound great and are really nice quality build along w/ the charging box.  It's also possible that it could be my phone (iPhone SE) but I found that if the phone is in my pocket the earbuds won't stay connected.  My wife used them at the gym and with her phone (also an iPhone SE) in a stationary position on the treadmill that she had no connection issues.  I changed my rating to a 3 star bc of tozo's customer service, I wish I could give it a 5 star but the connection issues are still there for me.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
EDIT: Stopped working after just 3 months!,EDIT: I have changed my review to one star since the earbuds have stopped working just a month after my return window closed. I am so disappointed - they barely hold a charge and and even after charging them if you don't use them the battery runs out anyway. Wish I could return these.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
An Amazing experience!!!,This product is really awesome. I can't believe I could get this quality at this price. It was really easy to set up and start using in no time.

"1st ok, then annoying","So far so good for price. Find a little hard for people to hear me when I get calls, but got it for working out.

After 2 months kind of disappointed. It keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. When I 1st connect it beeps like 6 time's. The noise cancellation doesn't really work. My wife says she can never hear me. Hope the battery life failed so I can buy something else.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than expected,"Ok, was hesitant advertisement was correct but everything so far has exceeded my expectation, including - and most importantly - ease of use and sound quality!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Watch the video on how to use these,These earbuds came fully charged as did the case for them. So far they seem to fit my ears. These are the 6th pair of bluetooth sets I have tried. None well stay in my ears. I drove a dump truck and it is extremely noisy. I will update on noise cancelling.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sound quality is good, battery life is good","Bought these for husband for a birthday gift. He really likes them, says with the different size adapters they fit in ear perfectly. Noise reduction is of good quality as well as sound quality.
He was able to walk over 20+ feet away from phone and the sound quality on the phone was still good. I did not have any problems hearing him & know what he was saying. There was an occasional static the further he got from the phone, but it wasn't constant and I could still hear him well enough.
He says the music quality is good as well. There isn't much to complain about. Good price, good product thus far.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome product for the price!,"I was skeptical about purchasing these due to the price compared to others on the market. I’m glad I went with them! Absolutely great sound. It overpowers the local gyms music and is crisp and clear. Believe it or not has a decent bass hit to it as well. Charge time is pretty insane, I can plug them in literally for a couple minutes before leaving to the gym and they are charged up. As for falling out of the ear, I’d say 95% they stay in even when sweating. When I’m doing sit-ups at the end of my session they occasionally slip out. Also the cases charging port has a rubber boot that protects it when not in use. This thing is extremely difficult to get out to plug your charger into. Not that big of a deal at all... but worth mentioning. Overall excellent product and would buy again in a heart beat.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrible phone call headphone.,"They are ok. They are great for a “cutting the grass” pair of head phones. They are terrible for phone calls, meetings etc. I have been embarrassed on several occasions because of clarity.

I wish I’d have saved my money.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Wireless Earbuds,"I bought these in hopes they would just 'be adequate' but I was mistaken ... THEY ARE FANTASTIC!

Won’t hold a charge after two months of use,"At first I loved these headphones!  They don't budge in my ear and can stay put when I am cycling, running or even riding my motorcycle.

I honestly should’ve just bought AirPods.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very happy with them!,"I love these! Granted, I’ve only had them for a week, but I am super happy with them. They stay in well through my workouts, and I’ve only had them plugged into the wall once so far (but I do keep them in the charging case often). The batter seems to last well for what I use them for.

"Wonderful earbuds, easy to use, great sound","I had bought two other pairs of earbuds and they were either a real pain to pair or charge, or both, or they fell out of my ears.

IPX8 Waterproof rating is VERY misleading,"I bought these earbuds for swimming laps and they failed miserably. The second they touch the water they cut out and disconnect, despite their IPX8 waterproof rating that claims they will work in up to 1 meter of water for 30min. When i contacted TOZO about the issue, they completely blew me off and said they weren't meant to be used for more than just everyday sweat, a little water here and there, etc... So maybe they should give them an appropriate waterproof rating for that? ugh, so frustrating. Thumbs down to these earbuds for claiming to be something they clearly are NOT.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome alternative to expensive earbuds,"I love these earbuds! They fit perfectly in my ear, have good sound quality, and the charge lasts a long time.

Thank you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect Bluetooth Earbuds!,"I'm not a fan of the hard plastic earbuds, so when I wanted to try Bluetooth earbuds, I knew I wanted to have something with softer plugs. The TOZO T10 are great! No problems connecting quickly and the sound and depth is amazing! I would definitely recommend these to others. They are a tad bit heavier then the std plastic kind, but worth it for the connectivity and sound. 5 stars! Would buy as a gift for family and friends with zero hesitation!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbud but not everything is perfect,"I've been using these for about 2 weeks now. Sound quality is good, better than I expected from a $50 earbud. The charging is good and the case is amazing. I've only had 1.5 issues with the earbuds so far.
1. When I go biking to school, I leave my phone in my pocket and it cuts off a lot when I'm biking. Only when I'm biking, so every other time it's perfect. Sadly I'm mostly using these earphones while I'm biking so that's kind of a bummer. But I bought this phone case that attaches to my backpack so theres no connection problem there now.

Kind of an issue?? I don't know but the left earbuds feel different (like its looser). The right earbud fits in perfectly with my ear, and I've changed the ear foam thing on both sides to make them feel equal. I thought maybe it was my ear?? but like I've never had to change my older earbuds before so I asked my brother to try it out and he also said the left side is looser. Its irritating so i'm still experimenting with why the left side seems looser.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Best use is for listening not for phone calls, with excellent sound quality","The sound quality from this items is outstanding, and I'm a trained audio engineer with an excellent ear. They are virtually distortion free. The bass support is excellent for such a small item. The buds fit comfortably in your ear, especially with the supplied multiple size cups they give you for best fit. Just be careful if you purchase this item for making/taking phone calls. The noise cancellation is very good, but you hear yourself from inside your head (as when you plug your ears and talk) so speaking this way can make some people uncomfortable.

I will add that the case that comes with this device, plus the overall packaging is very luxe and high tech; I love that! I use it with the Tozo wireless charger and love the futuristic, high quality look and feel. I recommend this item for those who want to listen to music and other sounds. Not necessarily the right item for long phone convo's.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Satisfied,So far so good! The sound quality is pretty dang good! It came packaged well and they feel pretty nice. I bought a different wireless earbud and ended up returning them because they stopped working after two weeks of little use. I came back to this one and I like how sturdy the earbuds sit in the case. They definitely won’t budge like the other earbuds I had purchased. I’m loving them so far!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Maybe  a defect?,"Sound is pretty good. Set up easy. The left earbud will regularly cut out for a split second.  It's very annoying.  It does this at least once every 2 to 3 minutes.  The right one doesn't do this,  leading me to believe there is a defect with this. I may return
I will say that the customer service responded very quickly and is working to remedy the matter",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
excellent value,"I run a lot, sweat a lot, and spend a lot of time in the steam room post-workout. Have had these for a while now with zero problems. Even jumped into a pool with 'em in my ears, and they still work great. Sound quality is good, not great, but that's to be expected; with a bit of manipulating the equalizer in your music app, they can be plenty powerful and provide sufficient sound quality for exercise. At the price point, you really can't beat the value provided here.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Fantastic sound, unbeatable price, very responsive customer service.","I purchased these earbuds back in January of this year, and have used them faithfully everyday!  They pair easily to my iPhone and iPad and stay connected for more hours than any other pair of Bluetooth earbuds I have owned.  One feature that I love about them, besides the sound quality is that you don’t have to turn them on or pair them once you have set them up.  You just take them out for their case and put the. In your ear and start using them.  I mainly use them to watch videos on YouTube, as I spend a lot of time in the hospital as I am a cancer patient.  Their customer service is outstanding, when I had a problem with them, and couldn’t figure it out on my own, I sent the company and email and they responded within 24 hours with a solution to my problem.  I highly recommend these earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty decent for the price.,"For the price, it is pretty decent. Sound quality is pretty good, not the best, and I stressed test the battery life during work. It played music nearly up to four hours, including breaks, without being putting into the portable charger. The only thing that bothers me is the left earbud pretty much has to practically be right next to the right earbud to pair and that sometimes the right earbud doesn't want to charge in the portable charger. But a simple remove and putting it back in is enough to fix it though.  Also if the phone/Ipod isn't nearby, static is imminent so range isn't the best either. Otherwise, you get what you paid for.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome wireless earbuds,"I bought the first pair of earbuds to try out. I had bought other brands and they did not hold the charge, or the noise cancellation did not work.

These earbuds are worth keeping,"I can't say I have any issues with these bluetooth earbuds so far. They arrived in a day which was pretty good, everything came prepackaged which tells me it's of some good quality.

They sound really good the bass is nice and punch, loud enough, not is it deafening you just gotta find the right size bud, no static and good range. They fit nice and perfect in My ears.  Connecting them to my S9+ was a breeze. Just turn on your phone's bluetooth and turn on the earbuds they will pair up tight away

They have the option to take calls reject calls and redial. Pause and play but no next or previous track, which is my only issue.

REALLY GOOD BUY!!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product, would recommend","I bought this product because I needed earbuds to wear at the gym without the cord getting in my way. These earbuds are great. They have good sound quality and cancel out the noise around you. They also stay in my ear very well, especially since they have multiple sized ear pieces. It’s also interesting how the charging case can be charged by a wireless charger, I didn’t realize this until after I bought them",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Amazing quality, amazing comfort!","I have just had these earbuds for 3 days and I'm so impressed by them now.
First, they are really comfortable the box comes with several options for you to find an ear plug of your size, and once you do, they are great to wear. I've tried jumping, shaking my head, and running, and they dont slip a bit! They just wont fall of your ear.
Second, the sound quality. As soon as I got them I played a few songs and even watched ASMR videos on youtube and the quality is even better than my wired earphones.
Also the battery has great endurance. I've used them at the gym for 2 hours, then school for walking around, then work, and they haven't died on me. The fact that the case charges them is extremely useful and so far I havent had to charge the case.
An extra detail that I liked is that it includes a lace that you can attach to your case and wear is as a necklace or wrap it on your backpack or on your belt as I wear it (as shown in the images)
Overall great earbuds and definitely worth it",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Inconvenient but good,"This is an updated review. With a lot of trial & error, I found the trick to make this earbuds work. Set up was super easy. But I had A LOT of problems with the sound cutting out during my hike. I kept my phone in my pocket. So I put it in my pack & zipped it up. Same frustrating problem. Then I held my phone in my hands. To my surprise, it worked! Sound quality was great. But super inconvenient to hold my phone for a 2 hour hike! So I put my water pack in front & put my phone 1/2 way in the very small pocket & it was great.

Audio skips / drops,"These headphones are ok for walking, and extremely frustrating to use while running. I originally had these synced to my phone which I carried in my hand while running. If my rhythm altered at all while running it would interrupt the audio connection and either skip or disconnect entirely. I recently purchased a Fitbit Ionic, and the earbuds did the same exact thing when paired with that device too. Although the idea of having wireless headphones was appealing, the connection is unstable regardless of which device I use. I have to stiffen my arm to prevent skipping / drops from music. I tested the connection by flexing my wrists up / down and waving my arm around with both my phone and Ionic, and the motions confirmed that is what was interrupting my wireless connection. I removed the device from my settings on both my phone and Ionic, then reinstalled it, but still had the same issues. The phone and earbuds were also fully charged. The really disappointing thing is I bought 2 pairs of these, and my husband's does the exact same thing when using the bluetooth feature.

The case is extremely convenient and pretty heavy-duty. The water resistance is also a nice perk. Another thing I like about these headphones is the case automatically charges the headphones when you put them back, plus there are magnets that hold the earbuds within the case. You can also visually see the charge progress and how much charge is left within the case even when it's closed because of the LED indicators.

I would wear these in the gym, and like I previously said, they do ok while walking if you do not walk briskly or alter movements unexpectedly. I'm currently searching for new wireless earbuds that I can sync to my phone and Ionic and not have to worry about the skipping or drops with the audio connection.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Happy Buyer!,I just received these earbuds and right off the bat I’m already very pleased with them! Set up was super easy and the sound quality is much better than I expected! I don’t think I’ll ever have them in water but knowing they’re waterproof is definitely an added bonus!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fall out of my elf ears.,"Update - they stopped working after week 2!

I had to replace my Bose wireless headphones and thought I would give these a try. First the good:
1. Love the case and how they automatically switch on.
2. Sound quality is good. Quite crisp and clear. Once you put them in properly with the right tips they give the Bose headphones a run for their money.  The bass might not be as good but good enough for most songs. I mean they are a fraction of the price.
3. Good build quality. So far they only cut out on the odd occasion. I’ve been able to walk around my whole apartment and they’ve been good. They sometimes cut out on the subway or in a very congested area. The battery life is comparable to Bose but since you have a case they have the extra advantage.

Now for the bad:
1. I’ve tried all the tips and when I use them to run they will fall out. Sometimes fall out when walking about. It’s infuriating. I guess my ears are elf like or something. I will have to get ones with a wire. Unfortunate really. Would have been perfect otherwise.
2. Controls are confusing. Why would clicking once dial my phone. How do I change the volume ? Hmmm. Ok ok just couldn't be bothered to read the manual.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bang For Your Buck!,"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.

In the box:
Very good packaging

2 wireless earbuds clearly labeled for left and right.

1 charging case

1 pair of the smaller rubber covers and a pair of larger ones in addition to the ones included on the earbuds themselves.

A 1 year extended warranty card (must activate within 14 days of receipt) - easy process using the provided car code!

Detailed instructions

The earbuds pair quickly and easily to each other and to my Note 9 with voice prompts letting you know when each is paired.  You also get a voice notification for incoming calls and when hanging up a call.

The buttons are pretty tactile, however you do have to give them a bit of force.  This does help in mitigating erroneous button presses though.

The earbuds fit my ears out of the box but come with various sizes so you can get the perfect fit for you.

I haven't done a complete workout with these but I have worn them for hours during moderate activity and they haven't fallen out of my ears.

The battery life is amazing!  I've used these for hours and they only got down to 80%.  The case conveniently charges the earbuds when they're not in use and I've only had to charge the case once after a few days use.

The case itself is a little on the large side but I'll take that trade off for the amazing battery life it delivers! Although I can comfortably carry these in my pocket (I'm 6'3 and have deep Jean pockets), most might opt to carry these in a gym or laptop bag.

The sound quality is decent given the price with lots of bass although I usually prefer a ""flat"" signal.  However,  I use the PI music app from the Play store which has a decent EQ so I just flatten out the signal there.  You'll definitely want to be careful not to listen to these with the volume cranked all the way up as they can get pretty loud.

The range is top notch!  I think I read these are supposed to work up to 10 meters away from the paired device but I've gone further without any drop in reception.

These earbuds are rated IPX8 which means they can get wet but you don't want to submerge them in water.  I've had these on in the rain with no issues.

Overall,  you won't be disappointed with your purchase!  These are high quality wireless earbuds! Enjoy your music and your savings!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound and comfortable,"These are my first pair of wireless earbuds. I care most about sound quality and these are crystal clear. You can hear the details in the lows, mids, and highs.

Great quality at a reasonable price.,"These are the first in-ear buds I’ve purchased (taking advantage of a daily deal), and I am quite happy with them. The sound quality is better than I anticipated for the price. Also, the battery life is way longer than stated. I used them for about three hours and they weren’t even half way discharged. One of the things I like the most is the ability to charge on my iPhone wireless charge pad. No messing around with cables. Very nice product, well built and paired up easily and with superb range.

Great buds with a minor software flaw (Updated),"Very solid earbud case. The sound and fit of the earbuds are great! My only dislike is that there's no way to skip to the next song (that I know of) without using your phone. Other earbuds usually have a double click to switch songs, but these earbuds call your last contact when you double click.
Not a deal breaker for me, but I would personally prioritize song switching over redialing.

Great earbuds for the price,"I will start by saying I VASTLY prefer wired over-ear headphones to anything else. I got these earbuds to use while I'm chilling on the couch on my laptop and my wife has borrowed them to work out. We were both satisfied but noted that the sound quality isn't there compared to over-ear headphones, but I think it's about as close as we're gonna get until they manage to make the electronics even smaller.

These earbuds feel like they're built with quality. They feel solid and have the heft you associate with quality built products. They come with 4 sizes of ear pieces which I greatly appreciated since one of my ear canals is bigger than the other. My earbuds also came with a little leaflet to register them within 14 days to get their 1 year warranty. REMEMBER TO DO THIS! It's well worth the minute it takes especially since other earbud brands have warranties that end after only 90 days.

I'm using these earbuds instead of my over-ears this week to test them out, and so far I reach ear fatigue around the 2.5-3 hour mark. My ears are a little sensitive so this is a little better than cheaper earbuds I've tried. It's also coincidentally convenient since they say the battery will last around 3 hours with normal use.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good quality wireless ear buds for good price,"I was in a need of wireless ear buds as my so called best quality apple beats wireless headphones didn't get a chance to last for about a year, thanks apple.

The only thing I will say the battery life isn't what I was looking for for 3.5 hrs compared to other wireless ear buds that can last for +5 hrs just for the buds for themselves or 34hrs with the buds and the case.

So after about a month, i decided to return them. Mainly the reason is that one of them does not stay in my ear and i have to push it very hard in order to be in place which results in muffing the sound. i tried the smallest cup but with no luck.

The item is and feels elegant. Quality is very good and very well built.
It come with 3 additional earpieces plus the one already attached. They can be replaced very easily.
Once you pull them out of the case, they auto connect to each other and then there is only a step to use them.
Bluetooth on your device, click on them and done!

Sound quality is by default very good. Personally i would like less bass but i adjust it from my devices. I connect to Samsung S7 Active and Tab 8.4 with zero issues. Only once happened to lose connection on Tab 8.4. Tried them in gym and no problems with sweat.

Small and portable I think is very good value for the price point when other brands are way to high.

So to be totally fair, if I didn't had the ear issue, i would keep them for sure. Small package, good battery, no really issues (hickups happens all the time with devices).",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud goes in and out.,I’ve had these for 4 days and the left earbud is already going in and out. I have the one year warranty so these are definitely going back for a refund. They’re heavy and uncomfortable as well and not worth $50.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10 Ear Buds,"I received these ear buds a week ago.  So far, I am very pleased with them.  They came very well packaged.  They were easy to set up and pair with my iPhone.  I really like the charging case they came in.  Good place to store the ear buds when not in use.  The set came with four sizes of ear caps.  They are a little difficult to change but definitely stay in place once put on.  The ear buds take a little getting use to in placing them in your ears but once you learn how it is no problem.  I think the sound quality is very good.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor phone call use (updated),"When I'm shopping for something on Amazon I typically like to purchase something with 4-stars or greater, and with 1000 reviews or more.  I purchased these for multi-function reasons, noise-canceling, music, and phone calls.  The earbuds worked great for noise-canceling but struggled from time-to-time staying connected while listening to music, which is not the worst, just a little annoying. However, the use of the earbuds during phone calls was horrific.  I had so many people tell me they couldn't hear.  It sounded like I was underwater or far away from my phone.  Since I spend a lot of time talking to clients and vendors I couldn't afford to keep them.  I had to return them!!

UPDATED:

After returning these items I quickly got an email from the manufacturer stating they were sorry about the poor quality and that they wanted to make things right by sending me a replacement set at no charge.  The customer service behind this company has been second to none.  Extremely proactive.  Extremely focused on you being happy with their product.  I would buy from this company again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Won't work with phone and meeting apps,"I really wanted to like these headphone. The sound quality and comfort and fit are great. However, they would only work with media apps like YouTube and Spotify. They would not work with meeting apps like GoToMeeting, Zoom, or Skype for Business. Also, would not let me use it with my phone app either. These had great potential but didn't meet my needs.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Company Stands by Solid Product,"I like to listen to a lot of music so I like to have several different kinds of headphones. When these came, they did not fit in my ear properly. However, I emailed customer service and they resolved my problem immediately. I had new ear pieces the very next day.

As for the sound quality, it's excellent. It's nice they are waterproof and I can wear them in the shower. However, I would not swim with them because they do tend to still fall out of my ears at times.

Overall, this product was exactly what I was looking for and it really helps that the company is so easy to contact if a problem does arise.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great headphones, great customer service.","I love the way these sound! Nice and clean, solid bass, and loud. I use them for the gym and running as well as my everyday travel and go headphones.

"Great sound, great price","I’ve bought (and returned) a few pairs of wireless earbuds in my efforts to find a good option. I’m picky about sound and too many of them just sound tin-y and have no bass or depth of sound.

I was pleasantly surprised that these sound great when they are at such a decent price point. They come with 4 different sizes of tips, and once I found the right size, it just took a little twisting to adjust the placement in my ear to block out noise and get the best sound. The batteries seem to last a decent time on a charge (haven’t timed it), but I’ve only had them a couple weeks so I can’t speak to longevity. Can immediately tell a huge difference between these and others I’ve tried and hope they’ll last!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Had trouble connecting after 1 hour,"Very disappointed - this product had great reviews. Used it the first time, and for the first hour, everything was good.

No noise cancelling feature to speak of.  Returned them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo responds and sends new buds,"Update to this review. They finally responded and corrected the issue with sending a new pair of ear buds that work. Thank you!
Haven't had the product for very long and the Master Right Ear Bud no longer works. Contacted the manufacturer and they refused to help or replace it.
When it worked, the sound quality was wonderful. But they have a very short life span. Ended up buying a different brand while we were trying to get Tozo to fix the issue.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Totally worth the money!!!!,"These are great!!! I’ve had mine for a few weeks now and I love them. I just wear one at a time mostly and then just switch them out after the battery dies. The battery life is great though. Lasts several hours!!!
The sound comparison of these versus a Sony wireless head set I have is insane. This is so much clearer!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Impressed!,"I use these earbuds every day! Gym, school, commuting on a bike, walking the dog, etc. So far the only mild complaint I've had, is an issue with keeping them in when running. I'm not sure if it's the sweat or the bouncing that pops them out. I'm still trying the other sizes, so it may resolve itself and it isn't enough of an issue to take any stars away!

I've been impressed with the sound quality. They cancel sound better than my Beat Studio 3s. I have been able to use them all day and not run out of charge.

I appreciate being able to connect a single ear bud and have a free ear (safety while walking or biking). I haven't had any complaints while talking on the phone.

Very happy I picked this up!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, waterproof...",I wear these earbuds while exercising.  Earbuds that are waterproof with great sound are hard to find.

The left earbud is faulty.,"I ordered my earbuds yesterday and received them perfectly fine, zero problems with shipping. When I opened the package they looked nice no visible damage, but the left earbud does not work. The left earbud does not charge or turn on. I didn’t use them because only one earbud worked. I definitely did not pay 49.99 plus the warranty for half a product.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
5/5 Would Recommend,"Amazing headphones for the price. Great sound quality, easy to use, although not true sound cancelling the design does a great job blocking external sounds. Fits comfortably even when wearing to bed.

"Great for music, not so much for phone calls.","For ~$50, these ear buds seem pretty great so far.  Having only had them a few days now, I'm pretty impressed with the quality of these.  The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that I've had multiple issues with the left ear bud cutting out, or not connecting properly.

Pros:
Pairing is simple and automatic, though it does seem to take between 30 and 45 seconds  on average.
Excellent bass and overall sound quality.
Once you twist them into your ear properly, they don't seem to want to wiggle loose.
Small, easy to carry case with wireless charging.
Speaking of the case; it's solid, with a lid that feels secure.  I'm not worried about the buds falling out in my pocket.

Cons:
Pressing the button on the ear bud takes a good bit of effort, and would get uncomfortable with frequent use.
The left earbud seems to have some connectivity issues.  I've only worn them a handful of times so far, and I've noticed  it a few times.

**UPDATE**
While the sound quality of these are fantastic, I ultimately ended up returning them for one reason: I was consistently unable to use them for phone calls. Every attempt to do resulted in the person I was talking to telling me that I sounded distant and in a cave. Since hands free calling was a big piece of why I needed new headphones, this didn't meet my needs.

If I was simply looking for music and not phone calls, these would still be excellent earbuds.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Extremely comfortable, good sound, happy customer","I was skeptical about these but I really needed a waterproof, affordable pair of buds that would work no matter what I was doing. I'm a fire instructor and have used these under my hood during evolutions, I've run with them, drove with them...so far they've exceeded expectations on all counts. Not sure how but these are better for phone conversations than the wired headphones that came with my new Galaxy phone. No idea how it picks up my voice so clearly.
Charging case is awesome also. In the words of Gump...""that's all I have to say about that"".
 I'll be flying a lot over the next few weeks so I'll update my review for that function when I get back.

VERY USER FRIENDLY AND GREAT SOUND!!!,"These TOZO wireless Bluetooth earbuds are amazing!  I had purchased a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds from another manufacturer on Amazon a couple of months ago, however I became extremely frustrated with them due to the fact that they practically had a ""hair trigger"" response and even the slightest touch would change just about everything. That being said, these TOZO earbuds are an absolute GEM.  They turned on and paired immediately after taking them out of the charging box. As soon as I initially paired them with my tablet, I was getting fantastic sound quality. The bass is excellent, and most of the outside noise was blocked out. I normally only use these when I am watching a movie on my tablet when I am flying.  The only thing they do not do is control the volume, but that was not an issue for me; the volume is very easy changed by a touch of a button on my tablet. To me, that is one less thing you have to worry about when you are trying to enjoy your wireless earbuds. The less buttons (or how long you have to hold this one or that one down for this or that) you have to think about is what works for me. They stay in my ears with no discomfort whatsoever. Good job TOZO!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The negative reviews aren't wrong.,"I tend not to let negative reviews get to me if the percentage is low. So is the case for these earbuds. When I first got them, I gave them a full charge out of the box. Went out to do some chores with my phone in my right pocket. Right away the buds start cutting on and off like crazy.
I tried to be positive about it. I usually wear a button up shirt with a pocket in front. I can just put the phone in my pocket.. the phone literally a foot in front of the buds. This seemed to work alright for a song or so. Than it started again. It seems like very little movement at all can cause a bluetooth interruption.
For example, as I type this with my phone in my face, everything is great. No cuts at all. If I lock my phone and put it in that top shirt pocket than the skipping starts again in less than 60 seconds and if i make any movement it gets worse.
At this rate I feel like I would have to tape my phone to my forehead to get these to work properly. I'm let down. For me while 50 bucks seems cheap, it's the most I've ever spent on earbuds. I imagine I will try them for a few more days but will likely request a refund. This is a bummer for me because i really wanted these to be the ones.
Audio quality is more than acceptable. Feeling is nice. Case is great. They simply do not work correctly.
Edit-after a while they dont even work right while I'm using my phone inches away from my face. This is bad.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love the tozo!,"Great buy ! The description of the product is accurate. I lost my buds but I have the warranty but I don’t know how to use it. Really sad about it.

Great headphones for the price,"These headphones are pretty great for the price. I wear them while working a desk job and can leave them in for hours with no issues of them falling out or hurting.

Better than Apple Earbuds,"Purchased the Tozo T10 earbuds in an attempt to find earbuds with great sound and a better fit than Apple, and I have been VERY pleased.  The sound quality is great and the fit is much more comfortable than the Apple style earbud.  No earbud is great at noise cancellation, so I wasn't expecting that feature.  The only shortcoming is that the Tozo's don't have the automatic pause feature when removed from the ear like the Apple's do, but this is not a dealbreaker!  The Tozo is a great product at a great price",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buy it,"Sound is OK but can’t compare to high ends like Bose. For the price I think it’s worth it to buy this.

I found the sound quality excellent!,"I loved the quality of the sound. It's rich, clear, and balanced. It took a little bit to learn how to use the system, but once I did, I found it to be a well-made product which delivers what it said it would.
My only issue is the built-in mike. When I used it with my iPhone 8 Plus, the person I was calling couldn't hear me. I'll have to learn that part of the system better!!
Good product. Well put together, sturdy and reliable.

Very High Quality for the Price.,"Honestly, these earbuds have surpassed my expectations. Right out of the box, the packaging is extremely high quality and you can tell the seller puts a lot of thought into first impressions. The earbuds themselves are very comfortable and do not fall out of my ears when I'm in the gym or when I'm just casually listening. If they do not fit well at first, then you can try the 3 other sizes of ear pieces that come with the earbuds, I personally need to use the smallest size because all others fall out. Sound quality is as good as an earbud can get, clear notes and easy to hear voices as well as a strong bass. Pairing was extremely easy and another thing that surprised me was the battery life. The case charges quickly and so do the earbuds; the earbuds also hold a very long charge. I was using them one night and forgot they were in my ears while I was watching videos for multiple hours, the battery never died and the quality never faded. The charging case is very well made and the magnets are strong, not to mention the purchase comes with a free 1 year warranty in case anything happens to your earbuds. Final verdict: if you are looking for wireless earbuds, buy these and don't look back. You are getting $200 worth of quality for the extremely fair price of $50 (as of when I bought them).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I washed them once!,I didn't really think the waterproof feature to these ear buds was ever gonna pay off for me (I bought them for the positive reviews on sound/battery/wearability-usually ear buds/pods constantly fall out everytime I turn my head). I'm a groundskeeper and custodian and I left the ear pieces in my scrub top and accidentally washed them AND THEY STILL WORK PERFECTLY. They do sometimes fall out but they are way way better than any ear pieces and now I'll use them while cooking or cleaning.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

An audio experience that you must have!

I use one earbud (Right since its master bud) for music and leave my Left one on while it's in the charging case. If you leave the left one off while it's in the case the Right bud will keep beeping trying to connect to the Left bud.

Too expensive for the quality.,"Sound is mediocre. For my ears, none of the tips work to keep these from falling out unless my body and face sit nearly motionless. This defeats the purpose of buying these. The back speaker is too big and too heavy which is what causes them to flip out of your ears if you are running, dancing, bobbing your head to the music, etc. The whole set up with the battery pack and general design is clunky and chunky. The mpow over ear, earbuds are around $20, come with memory foam inserts for your ears, sound better, are still waterproof and you can basically to cartwheels without them falling out.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would recommend but..,"I absolutely love these. They came with 4 different size earbuds so it was easy to find the perfect size. I love the little magnetic charging case they come with that easily fits in my pocket. I was able to leave my phone charging in one room and walk in and out of almost every room in the house without losing signal. The sound quality is amazing. Well worth the money.

I did only give them 4 stars though for the following reasons. I bought them to use at the gym while I workout. Unfortunately the left earpiece cuts out frequently when I'm at the gym and thats with the phone sitting less than a foot directly in front of me with nothing blocking the signal path. There have also been a few times I am at home holding my phone in front of me and the left one will cut cut out for a few seconds. I'm guessing there is too much interference at the gym and it's only slightly annoying, so I do still use them. I'm not sure why it cuts out on rare occasions at home and its always just the left one.

The other issue and this is a very minimal issue, is that they don't sit very flush in your ears. They stick out a little bit and are easy to accidently knock out if careless. You would need much larger ears I think for them to sit in there snug.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Weak Bluetooth signal,"I have only one major complaint against this product. The Bluetooth signal is rather weak, and cuts in and out if i put any type of barrier between the phone and the headphones. Example: If i have my phone in my back pocket and I sit on my phone, the signal gets cut on the hearbuds. If I'm in an office where there are several Bluetooth signals, connection drops in and out.

The earbuds are loud when connected, though you can only control volume through the device you're connected with (ex: Phone). A slight annoyance for me is that I'm unable to skip to the next song using the earphones. A person can use the earphones to make calls and answer call though. However, I've not taken a call using them because of the worry of the weak Bluetooth signal.

The reason for not getting a lower review is because it does do the other aspects. The sound quality is decent and battery life is as described. Even with the weak Bluetooth signal, it still does what I need it to do a good 83% of the time.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10 Blew My Mind,"Had absolutely no problem pairing the earbuds to my phone from the second i opened the box. Sound quality is out of this world for the price.

The TOZO T10 earbuds stand side by side with my wireless beats and was extremely shocked to see for myself how well these earbuds are. I had an open mind paying $50 for wireless earbuds and honestly wasn't expecting to get half the quality, comfort or durability that these came with.

After that...WoooHooo!  Good quality. I would definitely purchase these again!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Uncomfortable and fall out,"The main issue that I have are that no matter what size I put on the earbuds, they fall out while working out. I lift relatively intensely, and during the set I make movements and facial gestures that cause the buds to slowly slip out mid set nearly every time. This is extremely annoying, and gets worse when I start to sweat. When I'm not working out, I can get them to stay in the ear relatively well (if I keep my face still), however the pressure they place in the ear is really uncomfortable. Sound quality is ok, I like that they create a seal in the ear which makes what you're listening to more pronounced. They are really bass heavy, even when I set the equalizer to flat. Case is really bulky for someone used to airpods. Overall, these just aren't cutting it for me, and aren't worth $60. I plan to return if I'm able.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Tozo-Finally found earbuds that work good, aren't dorky big, and have bass, VERY happy.","First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.

7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Build Quality and Customer Service was Great!,I needed a new pair of headphones for working out since my last pair broke so I purchased the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds. The build appeared high quality and the battery life was great with the charging case. The only problem was that I could not get the headphones to stick in my ears. They kept falling out since the smallest ear caps were still too big for my ears. I contacted customer support yesterday and they responded quickly and offered to send me a replacement TOZO T5 TWS Bluetooth Headset since those headphones will stay on the users ears due to the over the ear attachment. Overall I would give this a 5 star review because it is so hard to find good customer support. I will post pictures when the T5 gets shipped and review that also.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth it.,Started out fine but they started to disconnect and reconnect randomly. After a point it was more disconnecting notifications than music playing through them.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product!,I have gone through several earbuds on Amazon over the past couple of years. I'm a big guy and sweat alot when working out so in addition to sound quality I need the to actually be water resistant as advertised. These are the first to actually deliver both! Great product and customer service responds rapidly when I had a couple questions.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
my hubby loved it,"I bought it to my husband as his first Father's Day gift. He loved it so much, keeps putting them every time he goes out, even when he goes for a short walk with the dog.

"Great for sleeping,great bass and clear sound,truly water proof!","Color me impressed! I first fell in love with wireless earbuds with taotronics. However i wanted to use them to sleep with and they do not fit comfortably laying on them. They also shorted out in the shower which scared me since they are supposed to be water proof. Enter TOZO T10. I took a chance since the profile seemed smaller and it  paid off! First thing i did was try them in the shower no problem at all! Washed my hair and everything lol. I'm a side sleeper and am able to fall asleep comfortably listening to my audio books. Big thing for people is sound quality i must say these SURPASSED my expectations! I can't even listen past half volume, deep bass, clear sounds and no crackles super impressed! The magnets in the charger are very strong no issues of them falling out and the case is sturdier and battery life longer than my taotronics set. I haven't used those since i got these! Only weird thing i noticed is if you put your hand up close to the non master side the volume fades on that side it's quirky but not annoying lol. I fully endorse these you will love love love them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good battery life, Great range","I haven’t had the headphones die on me once yet although I haven’t pushed it too hard. I was very surprised with the range on these headphones. I can leave my phone sitting out and clean the pool up to 40 feet away without too much interference. Looking forward to seeing if the performance is maintained so I will plan to update in a few months.

P.s. make sure you try a few of the different ear buds. I was surprised to find the smallest worked best for me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They actually work while wet!,"Sound is great, but loud outside noise's can be a bother. Otherwise they have a good wireless connection. The 4 pair of different size ear buds were great to fit best size. I really thought these were a great price and great quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the money works well not exactly made for activities with a lot of movement,I’m very satisfied with him so far I’ve been using them for about a month now. The magnetic charging of the devices and the case that they come in is really nice. The sound quality is great. The only thing I wish is that they had some sort of better keeping system to them so that they would fit inside my ear better I know they do come with extra size had to try and fit many different ear sizes but seems like the weight of the device Works itself loose in a matter what size I tried. So I wouldn’t really recommend them as an act of our work out type earbud but for sitting or walking around there not bad at all especially for the money sound and connectivity is great and battery life is pretty good I get about hour and 3/4 probably to a charge and they charge up relatively quickly and up to about three times from the case being fully charged.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great so far! Even fell asleep with them in :-),"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds.  I was concerned because I have small ears and all of the other ""hard"" style earbuds (like those that come with the iPhone), hurt and I can't wear them for long.  I am pleasantly surprised with how comfortable these are.  They were easy to use, right out of the box.  They are loud enough, even only at half strength, to allow me to enjoy what I am listening to without any noise from my surroundings.  Not only can I not hear my surroundings, but people near me can not hear what I am listening to either.

The first night, I fell asleep with them in, listening to a book.  Not only where they comfortable, but they didn't fall out when I tossed and turned.  I eventually woke up, took them out, and with the magnetic charging case they were even easier to replace in the case while I was half asleep!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO-T10 - Very Satisfied One-Eared Customer,"TOZO-T10 Satisfied One-Eared Customer, overall rating 4.9.

The primary reason I bought these earbuds was as a cheap alternative to using an expensive hearing aid for music listening during wet, cold, windy, and risky outdoor activities where I live in Southeast Alaska.  Having used them now for several weeks of fall hiking, boating, bushwhacking, road-side litter pickup, and working in/around home (as well as for frequent post-activity hot tub soaks), I am completely satisfied with their overall performance.

They are simple to use and are apparently quite durable (haven't killed one yet).  They have survived all challenging daily conditions, as well as some contrived testing challenges, and one good accidental dunking in the hot tub.  Simple and easy to use, I'm also perfectly satisfied with great sound quality, even compared to my very much more expensive hearing aid.  In addition, the large single button on/off control is easy to hit, even while wearing some gloves, unlike the hearing aid.

The second reason for purchasing this particular model, was reviews that indicated both buds can be used singly.  This aspect was important to me, because I am completely deaf on the left side with no ear canal.  Although not recommended, and maybe not an ideal fit, but I was very pleased to find that the left bud can indeed be fitted into my good right ear when desired, so that I effectively get two devices for the price of one.

I did discover that when only one bud is connected, it generates a periodic tone to alert the user about the disconnected device.  This repeats a few times, and then stops.  Did not find this mentioned in any users info, and I don't need it, but I can see how very useful it would be for most users to know that the 2nd device is disconnected.

I will most definitely be posting information about these particular earbuds on websites devoted to the single-sided hearing community.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product at a VERY FAIR PRICE,"This was my first purchase of wireless earbuds and I was hesitant not to purchase a set of high priced earbuds for fear of being disappointed in my decision.

Amazing product for great price,"These headphones are great. The buds are small and can be adjusted to fit your ear.After getting these I compared them with jlab wired headphones and jlab sports wireless. These took the cake. The sound was great, you are able to make out crytal clear noise, fulll of all the sounds. If you use a bud at a time,they last you all day. I love the wireless feature;being able to place them on my pad and wake up with them fully charged. The noise cancellation could be better but with the rich sound quality, you already don't pay attention to your surroundings.

Hope this review helped",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent!,"I did extensive research before purchasing these TOZO earbuds. Although others were inviting I kept coming back to TOZO. The sound quality, the balance between treble and bass is high quality and the noise cancellation is effective.

Best Wireless Earbuds I've Ever Used,"I've had these headphones for about a week now, and I could not be more happy with them. I've owned other products that were similar to these, but for less than $10 more than I spent on those other earbuds, there is a BIG difference in quality with these made by Tozo. Here are some of the things that stand out about this model vs earbuds made by other companies I've tried:

First of all, the build quality is fantastic. The charging case is sturdy, and the magnets which ""click"" the earbuds into place are very strong. This makes it easy to ""seat"" the earbuds so that they will charge, even in the dark as you're getting ready to go to bed.

The charging indicator lights on the inside of the case are A HUGE plus.

You can use one earbud at a time, effectively doubling the battery life on days when you'll be listening with them all day. One caveat here- there's an inconvenient ""beep"" when you only use one earbud at a time, but that goes away after about 15 seconds. The ""beep"" is to let you know that it's trying to pair with the other earbud. Like I said, though, when you don't use both earbuds, that beep goes away and you're free to listen, uninterruptedly after 15 seconds or so.

Battery life for the charging case and the earbuds themselves seem to be very good. I haven't really measured the amount of time the earbuds themselves stay charged, but the case itself has only needed to be plugged in once, and I've used these earbuds every day since I got them a week ago.

The fit of these earbuds is really nice in my ears, using the second-smallest plug thingys.

Like I said, I cannot say enough good things about this product so far. Amazon had a coupon for a set of similar earbuds to what I'd used before. That would have made them $10 cheaper than the Tozo ones, but I decided to spend a little more to get a LOT better quality. I'm glad I did",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Just Perfect!!,"At the begging I was a bit hesitant on buying the product. Once I got them and charge the properly, I have used them many, many times. I can recommend to anyone to get / buy this product, considering that the quality of it and the sound is simply perfect (for me)!!! I have Bose and Samsung earbuds yet the Tozo T10 have much better Bass than the other 2.

For the price you  will be paying for them, it is indeed a perfect buy and a ""Must get"" item.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Cheap crap, doesn't sync. Shrill, high frequency sound- low sound quality","It looks pretty, the battery case is solid, and it's cool the way magnets pull the earbuds into place in the case. But between the sound quality being so bad, and it not syncing properly, I had no choice but to return it. Looking online, I found the syncing problem to be somewhat common. People have come up with ways to make it sync, by powering everything down, making the phone forget the buds, restarting your phone, shutting everything down for at least 5 minutes, etc... None of those those methods worked for me. It was frustrating.

The sound quality is high frequency- it hurt to listen to it moderately loud, and gave me a headache. I thought I could get used to listening to it on relatively low volume, as it does block out most outside noise, but the straw that broke the camel's back was the second time I used it, when the left one wouldn't sync with the right. It's not like one could simply enjoy music with one ear. I don't understand how this product could have such a high rating.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible value!,"I ordered this item based off of the positive reviews. The package came quickly. Actually, it was perfect timing!

Another hour and a half of use right out of the box! Paired in moments. Noise-cancellation is to be expected from ear buds (good, as nothing is ever going to beat over-the-ear cans!)

"Decent sounds quality, but short battery life.","The earbuds are very light weight and have no issue staying in my ear throughout my day.

"Think about an other pair, but meh, these still work.","These sound pretty good. But the battery life, at least on my pair, is not good to say the least. Usually goes about 3-4 hours of on and off use with low volume while I take calls at work before saying the battery is low and they near shut off. But the most annoying parts are, you cant just use 1 with out the other or it beeps in your ear non stop until you take the other one out of the charging case and just leave it on the desk or put it in your pocket or something. Also these things have had trouble connecting to devices unless you do it in an order of, taking out both headphones and waiting for them to pair together, then pairing your device.. and the whole time, the things are beeping every 2 seconds until paired. Idk, these are horrible and are a good option for wireless if you don't mind the ""little things"" but I wouldn't buy again.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I like them and recommend getting a pair.,I bought the ear buds because so often I will get the wire caught up during a workout. The range on the ear buds is great and the sound quality is really good. I had to play around with the different sizes for the ear pieces. The first ones that were the most comfortable would fall out during fast direction changes. I switched sizes and can do anything without the ear buds falling out.

Surprisingly Impressive,"When I got these earbuds, they were on sale, seemed decent and claimed to be waterproof. I am so glad I did. The case is well made and sturdy, and the magnets are strong enough to keep it closed (it flops around my messenger bag all day) yet still easy to open. The earbuds themselves are also secured in the case by magnets, which not only helps to keep them safe and secure but also charges them.

These come with different sized cushions so you can find a comfortable fit. I am still trying to find that ""perfect"" fit, but yet soft enough to wear for long periods at a time even if you are only wearing them for the noise cancellation.

Not only was I impressed with the NC, but the sound blew me away! Please keep in mind; I am not a professional, nor an audiophile, but wow! I had gotten the Sony XF-1000X earbuds then, decided I wanted something waterproof. So I returned those and got these and haven't looked back.

Impressive and left earbud interruptions SOLVED,"UPDATE #2:
If you're having problems with your left earbud audio being interrupted, contact their technical support and let them know!
I requested support for my left earbud interruption problems, and they happily sent me replacement. I've been trying the replacement for several hours a day for the past couple of days, and several recharges during that time, and I will have to say the problems with the left earbud momentarily losing signal from the right earbud have practically vanished! Now, I'm really happy to have such awesome sound, uninterrupted. Back to 5 star rating. I still get some rare interruptions when working with my arms over my head and in tight, enclosed spaces. But that is probably to be expected for the nature of any true wireless earbuds?
I liked that their technical support was eager to help me with my earbud problems. Once they verified my purchase, it wasn't long before I had a free warranty replacement in hand that worked great! How refreshing! :-)
Some other additions to my review are:
These earbuds come with 4 sizes of removable earpieces to fit different sized ears. There's 2 sets consecutively larger than the size installed from the factory, and 1 size smaller. The one from the factory fits my ears just fine, but was a little too small, and I could tell because I could still hear additional noises around me. To replace the ""tips"", I recommend gripping the earbud firmly with one hand, and the removable ear piece/tip with the fingers of the other hand, squeezing the tip gently, but firmly, and twisting back and forth a little while pulling away. (Reverse that for putting on the new tips, being careful to get the removable cap lined up properly with the tube). For me, the next size up still fit comfortably, and blocked out most of the surrounding sounds. This was my ideal fit. The sizes were close together, and difficult to tell next size up (or down) until I laid them all out side by side for comparison. The largest size has a black ""center"" (instead of red like the others).
Another observation to record is that I think I noticed that the earbuds wont charge until you take the case (battery pack) off of being charged / its charger? Someone feel free to crrect me if I am wrong. But on mine, I would charge the base up (amount of charge indicated nice by four blue charging leds), then when I removed it from the charger, the earbud indicator lights would turn red indicating that they were charging. when everything is charged, all the lights turn off. I found I could get them all turn turn back on (to see the charge level of the case and make sure the earbuds were charged) simply by lifting the earbuds a little and letting magnetism pull them right back down to the charger.
It seems like the case does not hold its charge after a couple of weeks? I could be wrong about that as I may not have charged it after draining it the last time?

UPDATE #1: After some heavy use of these earbuds, I had to come back and lower my rating (from 4 to 3) on these earbuds. They are great earbuds, but the reason for my lowering this rating is because of the number of times the left earbud loses connection from the right earbud. The music in left earbud stops play and then usually comes back shortly afterwards. even when I am sitting typing at my computer (low activity). It definitely happens more often when I'm working / doing activity while using the earbuds (high activity). This happens even when the earbuds are fully charged. I have also reset the earbuds according to the manual (purple flashes). And that has not helped any. I'll inquire with their technical support as well.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
(Please note disclaimers at the bottom of this review).
This is my first true wireless earbuds, and I like them a lot!
I bought this because I wanted to listen to music in my basement while moving around a lot and not have to play the music loud and disrupt my wife upstairs. I felt this product had good reviews and was a reasonable price to introduce me to the bluetooth true wireless earbuds.

PROs:
Nice packaging
The manual was good / decent enough for me to be able to understand and use most of the functionality of the device(s). Furthermore, I found that the device(s) behaved as the manual indicated they would. They readily advertise their support contact information throughout.
Device(s) came with a partial charge so I could start using it right away if I wanted. However, I usually charge them fully first.
I did have to change the earpieces to fit my ears better. I'm glad it comes with 4 different sized earpieces. The instructions did not specify how to change the earpieces. I didn't want to break them and could not tell for a while if they pulled on/off or screwed on/off. (They pull on/off).
Devices were easy to hook up and get to operate. I did not have any problems pairing with my computer. I have NOT tried pairing with other devices.
I felt like the bluetooth range was reasonable. I dont have much (other bluetooth devices) to compare it with, though. The more centrally located in the house the bluetooth source (my computer) was, the more range I could get throughout the house / basement. And of course anything getting in between you and the source diminishes or interrupts available signal strength, especially metals.
I really liked the sound quality of these earbuds, and I felt like they did a good job of sealing out surrounding noises. They do not actively cancel any noise around you, though. I was happy with the sound quality. I'm also not an audiophile. I felt like the trebles were crispy, and the bass boomy. It does not come with an EQ, so you have to use your own EQ if you want to customize your listening experience to your preferences.
They come with a built-in microphone, but I also did not test that feature. This was important feature to me though, in case i wanted to do conference calling or other calling in the future.
the earbuds have a ""button"" on each one. The instruction manual contains details about their use.
I did not test the water-proofness of these earbuds.
I feel like the battery life was accurate: I think mfr specified about 4 hours of battery life for the earbuds before you had to recharge them(?). I got about this and maybe a little more.
The earbuds seemed to be very (acceptably) light for their functionality / lifespan. But again I have no frame of reference.
The charging lights are all inside the carrying/charging case. you can see the lights through the top of the case (kind of a smokey tint to the case. You can have the lid open to see the lights better, or closed and still see the charge status. It seems like you can charge the case or charge the earbuds, but not both at the same time(?). Either that or it took a lot longer to do both at the same time. It did not take too long to charge the case from completely drained (couple hours?), and about an hour or a little more to charge the earbuds from dead.
The earbuds have built in voice that can guide you occasionally, like when battery is low, etc.

P.S. wireless charging is pretty cool! No wires to regularly plug and unplug once the charging unit is set up. Just lay down your device to charge it and pick it up when needed.

CONs:
One thing that was kind of annoying was disconnects / losing connection (interrupting the music). The left earbud pairs with the right earbud, and they have to have good communication with each other on either side of your head. Sometimes, when getting too close to a monitor, other electronics, other rf noise sources (like cfl lights), or even just putting my hand/arm up to rest my chin on it while sitting in front of my computer would cause a disconnect between left and right earbuds until I removed the interference to a greater distance. rarely it would lose connection for apparently no reason at all. But the other times, the difficulties were obvious, and simply avoiding those interferences would quickly bring back the music. This is the reason I had to give the product 4 stars. I would be willing to live with the occasional disconnect and give it 5 stars, but the disconnects were enough to annoy me at times and thus 4 stars. In all cases (except going out of range and being disconnected for too long causing a timeout), the earbuds would continue automatically once interference removed.
When signal would be interrupted, though, the earbuds would very kindly fade the music (audio). There was no popping, crackling, blowing out your eardrum, etc noises.
Among the manual / instructions was an insert called ""wearing steps"" that I felt was difficult to understand. But I figured it out eventually.

DISCLAIMERS:
disclaimer1: Manufacturer is offering a free wireless charging pad in exchange for a review. I dont usually submit product reviews because everyone else does such a good job, but a free wireless charging pad to use with the earbuds would be nice. I endeavor to be truthful and not let this sway my review.
disclaimer2: This is my first true wireless bluetooth earbuds. I'm just getting into the bluetooth scene, and so dont have a lot of bluetooth product experience to draw from, but I am an electronics geek, and do have some related electronic and PC computer experience and history.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My Favorite Commuter Headphones,"These Tozo T10 headphones are simply the most ideal commuter headphones I have yet to find. Originally, I tried a couple different kinds and styles of headphones (even bone conductor ones like the AfterShokz Aeropex) and I did end up keeping one pair of Shure ones (for sound quality purposes, (which I also just purchased recently in 2019)), but these were my favorite for everyday use. I also currently own a pair of Sennheiser HD 380 PRO (purchased in 2017) that I do enjoy, but are inconvenient for travel. I also previously owned a pair of SONY MDR-XB90EX (purchased back in 2015) where the left ear bud unfortunately failed on me recently so I discarded them. I still got 4 years of use out of them though soooo not the worst thing ever.

I've only used the Tozo T10s for about a month so far, but I use them every morning/afternoon during the workweek on my commute into DC to work, which is about 50 mins/each way every day so total (1.4hrs/day). The headphones constantly recharge in the travel case and the charge capacity in the travel case lasts about 3 days with headphones plugged in. Basically all I have to do is charge them in the middle of the week and on the weekends. They stay connected impressively well, signal drops off infrequently (like maybe 4 times so far), but not enough to bother me. I test this periodically too just by stopping the music on my phone to talk to someone and then playing music again. It usually only takes a moment for the headphones to recognize it and pick it back up again.

My favorite feature is that they auto-connect to my phone immediately right after taking them out of the travel case so no need to hassle around with buttons. The sound quality is pretty strong for most peeps mostly because the base is totally there, but I will admit that mid-high range is not fine-tuned. My Shure headphones I mentioned earlier (model SE215SPE) are wired in-ear and have much better sound quality, but are also more expensive and such a hassle to deal with fitting in the ears, etc. I only take them on long trips (on an airplane, sitting at a computer, etc). With the Tozo T10 ones, I can slip them on super quick and absolutely love that they actually STAY in my ears.

It's tricky for me to get in-ear headphones that fit really well because I have a tragus piercing in my left ear and a daith piercing in my right ear, which makes me have to wear a size down in my left ear with the plastic ear piece. Yet, both headphones rest super snug in both ears. Overall, these headphones are a fantastic purchase that I'm happy I made.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for my Apple TV!,"These are perfect for watching your AppleTV if you happen to be one of the folks who can't wear the Apple Airpods because they slip out of your ears.  These earbuds are super comfortable, have excellent sound balance between bass and treble, fantastic range, and excellent battery life. Please see the other reviews because I am not the only one who is extremely pleased with the TOZO. Thank you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Earbuds,"I really enjoy these earbuds. I had purchased the Bose Soundsport Free earbuds and I ended up returning them because they had hurt my ears. I purchased these TOZO T10 earbuds and they are a game changer. They have really good sound quality and an extreme amount of bass. I absolutely love bass, I had three subwoofers in my previous vehicle, and I still had to turn the bass down with an equalizer on my phone. They are wicked ""bassy"". I washed my truck with them in and got water on them and theyre fine. I wouldn't go submerging them, but getting water/sweat on them is no big deal. They work great.

I do wish that the sound went a little louder, and the bass wasnt as intense. I think the bass overcompensates the sound. If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that are truly wireless, and have great bass, these are the ones for you. They aren't that big either, a big plus to be able to fit the charging case in my pocket. I'm also a fan on the wireless charging. They will work with any wireless charger",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wow!,"My 22 year old daughter ""misplaced"" my previous pair of blue tooth earbuds so I had to buy a new ones. I got on Amazon and started looking around and found these. They looked cool, were in my price range and had received a lot of great reviews so I bought them. I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't really read much about them before I purchased them. Just another one of my many impulse buys. LOL! When I received the buds and started reading about them I was floored. They're WATERPROOF! That's insane! I haven't tried them in the shower yet, though, so I can't give you a review on how well they work in water. The carrying case is very solid and it needs to be because its' also the charger for the ear buds. You DO have to keep the case charged with a USB but when you need the buds charged you simply place them back in the case and whamo. Way cool! I've not had any problems with the buds moving around or falling out of my ears. Just follow their advice on sizing. Also, way cool! But the best feature is THEY SOUND AWESOME! I'm not an expert on stereo or sound equipment but I know what I like and I LOVE these. Buy them! You won't be sorry.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and worked well,"Right earbud will not power on, or charge anymore. Earbud would die after around 2 hours of use after charging all night. I'm a day past the return window and left with a $30 paperweight. Avoid the Tozo brand. No customer service number or website that I could find.

Update 2/28/19: After posting on their Facebook page, they responded and are sending me a new right ear bud.

After getting the replacement, everything works fine and I'm happy with the ear buds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price,"I purchased these when they were $46. Sound quality is more than what I expected for wireless buds. Tested them in the shower for durability, and they're awesome--moreso if you don't want to wake up your roommates/significant other when you're trying to hype yourself up for the day. In terms of battery life, they're okay--haven't fully utilized the 3.5hr playback time. The charger box is great when you are out and about and can get a quick charge for your buds. However, the box does lose its charge--I had it fully charged so that I could charge my buds when not in use. After about three days or so of not being in use I brought them with me to the mechanics only to find out that the box lost quite a bit of its charge. So be sure to keep an eye on that before you head out to use these. Overall, I am quite happy with these earbuds and for the price (especially now) you can't beat it. Sound quality, durability and wireless charging (for the box), the Tozo 10s are pretty nice.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound!,"First world problem: They cancel out enough noise that I have to keep removing them when people talk to me. Can't hear a word they're saying. They sound awesome. Btw, don't use as hearing protection for shooting. They block the sound perfectly, that's not the issue. Apparently a magnum load 12 gauge will distort it enough to start ringing. Other than that, these things are great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
GREAT PRODUCT,"OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT, SUPER GOOD SOUND, DEEP BASS. I LOVE HOW THEY AUTOMATICALLY PAIRED THE FIRST TIME AND EVERYTIME I TURN THEM ON THEY CONNECT SUPER FAST TO MY PHONE. I THINK THE COOLEST PART OF THESE BUDS ARE THE SWEET CASE/CHARGING DESIGN. REALLY COOL LOOKING CASE AND THE BUDS GET SUCKED IN BY MAGNETS WHEN CHARGING SO YIOU GET A GOOD SECURE FEELING WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THERE THAT IF THE CASE GETS JUGGLED AROUND THE BUDS WILL BE SAFE. ITS A GREAT DESIGN THAT IM ODDLY IMPRESSED WITH. GREAT PRODUCT AT A SUPER AFFORDABLE PRICE POINT",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Solid design, exceeds expectations.","I bought these as a simple way to accomplish running with music, without fighting with wired earbuds.  Apple earbuds’ design does not work for my ears and thus I wanted an “in-ear” earbud.  I am very pleased with these.  They come with multiple sizes of ear “adapters” so I was able to easily find a fit.  Sound quality exceeds my expectations, even compared to my standard wired earbuds.  The case is solidly constructed and charges the buds quickly though I have yet to determine specific battery lifetime numbers, I know they will outlast my running endurance.  In short, if I lost these tomorrow, I’d buy another to replace them without hesitation.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo 10 great ear buds,"These ear buds are really great. They have very good sound quailty. They fit is very good once you find the right size tips. They connect to my phone fast. When talking on the phone sound quality is clear, was told that I was clear on the other end. I like how you can get extra charges with the case. The only thing I wish these ear buds had was tap controls, instead of having to push the button in to answer call pause music ect....  Other than that I am very happy with my Tozo 10 was buds",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall they are ok,"They sound great, I can get 3 hrs of music life out of them. The left will not work without the right one. The left one fits perfectly and doesn't fall out or move, for the life of me I cant get the right one to stay in my ear. I tried all the different size things and even ones from other headphones with no luck. I actually lost the right one while on the riding mower but I turned the mower off and the volume up and found it under the grass. I tried to just use the left and put the right in my bra didnt work, the music just kept cutting in and out like it lost the signal from the right one. I do like how far you can be from your phone, it's a good distance.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for working out,I had been using a wired set of earbuds for a couple of years and finally decided to find something wireless and sweat proof.  These earbuds were the perfect pick.  The sound quality is great. I usually run on a treadmill and watch a movie. It’s definitely noise canceling. They fit great using the smallest size. Definitely recommend these!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent customer service,"The sound quality of these earbuds are amazing. The battery life is not that great, I only get between two to three hours of use per full charge. As far as comfort goes, they are extremely comfortable and they stay put well. The main reason for my 5 star review is due to the extremely great customer service that I have experienced. They are quick to return emails and VERY fast to replace a defective device.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disappointed...,"The sound quality for listening to music is great. The issue I have with these ear buds is when I'm on a call, I can hear everyone perfectly fine but every person I talk to say they can barely hear me. I've tried turning the volume all the way up but I'm always told I sound really far away. Also, it doesn't hold a charge long, which is frustrating. I had such high hopes for these but I'm very disappointed.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Headphones, better than Bose, 1/4 the price.","This is my first pair of wireless headphones. I have tried the airpods and they never stay in my ears. I tried a friends Bose and while they sounded good, the price scared me off. I have a couple pair of TaoTronics wired headphones and absolutely love them so I bought the Taotronics wireless earbuds as well at the same time as the Tozo T10. I tried the Taotronics first and got exactly what I wanted, affordable wireless ear buds that sounded good. I then put in the TozoT10's and was completely blown away at how good they sounded. It was like my ears were woken up. They sounded so good I had to try the Taotronics again to make sure I wasn't hearing things, I wasn't. These headphones sounded much better, I gave my wife the Taotronics and kept the Tozo for myself. The pairing process went exactly as they describe. I had no trouble connecting right to my ipad and iphone. I really feel like the twist motion will keep them in my ears when I workout. I always have a problem with phones falling out and my initial reaction is that these were very secure.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality Buy,"Fabulous find!

Smart Earphones & great customer service,"I was debating between this one (due to high amazon reviews) vs. the airpods.. Obviously, since this is a third of the price I thought I'd give it a shot. I've used it for a week:

pros: fits correctly in the ear and hasn't fallen out yet, sound quality is really good, mic is good when tested with a call, and you can pause podcasts/answer and end calls, and pairing is super easy. I love that when you take it out of the charging case, it automatically turns out and tells you that it is on.

one thing to note is that there's no way to increase/decrease volume once it is on unless I use the phone. However, I am not sure that airpods do that either.

one great note is that the customer service seems great. I had a minor issue, and responded right away. Will update once I have used this a while bit longer!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disconnects constantly,"Product constantly disconnects and reconnects. I know it's not my phone because other products are just fine. I would pass on this.

Will not disappoint!,"I have tinnitus in my left ear. I can use these earbuds one at a time, and always have music in my ears (or answer phone calls). Music or white noise really helps the tinnitus throughout the day. I bought them for running, which I still use daily. Charge the case and the earbuds charge once you plop then back into the charger case. I use them daily, 6-9 hours (switching them out to charge).

So instead of getting another pair, I just returned them and pony up and got the Samsung earbuds that has a soft ""beep"" instead.  TOZO are very impressive just not for me. PS.

So brilliant.,I had a $20 set of bluetooth earbuds purchased a year or two back.  They were on an awkward behind the neck tether and the signal constantly dropped out.  These babies offer true wireless and they never drop the signal from my phone.  They're comfortable and they sound amazing.  And so easy@  They basically auto connect to device when removed from the carry case.  What more do you need?,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would not recommend,"Sound quality is bad, it's not nearly as 'clean' sounding as my other earbuds. There is a lot of noticeable crackling even at low listening volume (25%).
Range is terrible compared to other earbuds. Best case these have a range of 15 feet (I'm used to 30 feet). These will cut out even with your phone in your pocket.
Fit is good, I was able to run/jog with these in without them falling out.
Controls are very lacking, not being able to control volume/skip songs through the earbuds was disappointing.
Set-up was easy, earbuds came charged and had them working within a few minutes.

I've yet to try the water-proof feature of these, but in all honesty unless you put your phone right at the edge of the pool these wont have the range to be useful.

I can't see any scenario where I would recommend these, even if you don't care much about sound quality the terrible range and lack of useful controls do not make these worth it.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Bluetooth Earbuds!,"These have been great so far. I was worried about the weight and the sizing, as I have rather small ears, but neither have been an issue.

the best bang for your buck,"I original bought a pair of these earbuds and loved them straight out the box. the sound they produce was crisp and clear with nice deep bass. you can hear nice clear sound even over the lawn mower. the product is awesome you can't go wrong , and the it gets better.

Ok head BT headphones,"These are ok. In the past couple of days of using them, I began to see some flaws in the design of the product. The product page says is Ip8, but at the bottom of the charging case, it says Ip68. But regardless of the Ip rating, it did well with sweat during my runs. The stock bud tips were ok, ended up switching them out for the MPow Flame ear tips cause the stock ones didn't feel all that secure in my ear while in use. One big gripe I have is that it does not automatically connect to my phone. I would literally have to go in the bt settings to connect to it ( I cleared out all of my bt connections to see if that would fix it, it didn't. Waste of time) and my phone is either in my hand or inner coat pocket. For $50, I would expect it to automatically connect.

Pros - lightweight, stays in place, sound quality is good, good battery life.
Cons - charging case is bulky (not very pocketable), does not really feel secure when running/walking, would always have to adjust with stock ear tips on, does not automatically connect to phone when the device is close by, unable to use as a mono headset w/o the right device beeping.

6/25/19 Edit: So after a couple of months of use, it finally happened. The right pod popped out of my ear and on to the subway tracks during my morning commute to work. I was using the stock ear tips as well.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unique earbuds backed up by good customer support (edit),"This appears to be the only reasonably priced truly waterproof, truly wireless ear buds that you can wear in the shower and such. Unfortunately the microphone quality makes it useless for calls, and the company apparently has poor quality control because the first one developed a strange issue with the audio coming out very quiet on one side, and the replacement device the company provided has a weird buzzing in response to certain frequencies, which is rather annoying and makes for very poor audio quality overall. I was going to give them another shot with a return but the return window expired before I got around to it, so I guess I'm left with a decent and usable wireless, waterproof earbud set with poor audio quality of both the microphone and sound drivers.

Edit: I discovered that even though the Amazon return period expired, the Tozo warranty still had me covered. A few emails and a return postage later and they say they will be sending me a replacement! Added 2 stars.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good product and fantastic value,"Got these a few days ago and I love them.  For the price the sound quality is excellent, they fit my ear very well and don't fall out at the gym.

"Great for Running, the Gym and Drowning out Loud Coworkers.","When shopping around for new bluetooth headphones, I came across these TOZO T10s.  It was important to me that 1) they stayed in my ears while being active. 2) That the sound was great and 3) Noise cancelling was highly effective.  After having these for 2 weeks, I can confidently state that these have checked all those boxes.  It is important to get the right bud size to ensure a tight fit and sound profile.  You may have to test out the different sizes to do so.  Another nice feature is the auto connect process.  Simply just pull the buds out of the charging case and they turn on and connect.  It is quite fast and impressive.

I give the TOZO T10 a 5 star rating for meeting my needs. Some ""nice to haves"" would be track and volume control (it does have pause/play) but definitely not a deal breaker.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Product and Service!,"One of them stopped working after I dropped the case. Fortunately it comes with 1 year warranty so I contacted the customer service email and I was pleasantly surprised. It took only about 10 minutes to get a response and they were very friendly, offering a free replacement.

As for the actually sound quality (referring to before I broke them) and product details, they were great! The sound for music is very clear, and the battery life is pretty good. I can get though a day with moderate use. I used them at the gym recently and they stayed connected even when I went a bit away to get a wipe for the machine. I also really appreciated the size options for the squishy part, as it helped them stay on.

Not truly waterproof - do not recommend for lap swimming,"The product description says that these can be submerged up to 1 meter. However this is blatantly not true if you would actually like to continue listening to music during those moments of submersion.
I specifically bought these to use while swimming laps but my first time out they were a miserable failure. The second I would dip my head below water, they would immediately disconnect and the only way to reconnect is to go back through my phone. This obviously does not work for anyone who is actually trying to swim laps. I have tried since but have had zero success. If you see the pamphlet above, the headphones may be able to be submerged a meter without breaking but they certainly do not play music or function in any meaningful way.
Unfortunately, by the time I finished trying to make this product work for me, the return window had closed so I am stuck with these ear buds. Wanted to save others from this same fate if at all possible.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones with Quality Sound,"These headphones have great sound and completely block out the noise around me.  I can't wait to try them during hunting season while in a tree stand.  The multiple sizes for ear inserts is a bonus as well.

A pair of high quality earbuds with magical sound that defies the price!,"I have been postponing purchasing a pair of earbuds because I have always felt that the quality of sound was not up to par with wired headphones or blutooth headsets. Not the Tozo T10's. Every action from taking it out of its charging case to syncing it with my iPhone was easy peasy. Crystal clear highs with punchy lows with quiet passages. Couldn't ask for anything better. Well, at times it's difficult to know which is the right and the left because of the dark print on the buds. I'm being too picky because there isn't anything to fault with these exceptional blutooth earbuds. Highly recommended!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So far great!,"Initial impression: Sound quality and fit are great, there are several sizes and different shapes of the earbuds, so it's easy to get a comfortable fit. I tested my earbuds sound quality on a large variety of genres from Dubstep to Trance, Classical, Rock and Roll, and Country as I like basically everything, and the sound was great all around. Bass was a little weak as you'd expect from any earbuds, but better than most of the earbuds I've tried including the wired ones.

This was an ALMOST perfect purchase,"When I recently purchased these earbuds,  I was looking for great sound for my music, easy connectivity, water resistance, Bluetooth 5.0, and a very clear mic for calls. And while I did find that a few of these needs were definitely met, I was extremely disappointed with the mic and charging capacity.

Pros...
The connection was pretty easy once I added the Bluetooth name to my Android phone. Each time I took out the earbuds from the charger after turning on my Bluetooth, they easily connected with each other.
These earbuds have GREAT stereo sound...very clear and rich sound which I think could rival higher priced earbuds.
The carrying charger case is a great size, very compact and the transparent lid allows you to see the charging lights while closed.
The earbuds stay put and come with 3 different size buds that should be good for any ear size.

CONS...
The mic...I called several different people to see how the calls sounded on both ends and ALL could barely hear me. I heard them fine on my end but it doesn’t really matter if no one can hear me. I did try putting the earbuds back into the charger and reconnecting to Bluetooth but it didn’t help. This is such a disappointment because if it weren’t for the poor call mic (and 1 other issue), I would have been SO happy with these!
The other problem is that the charging lights and possibly the charger itself was very inconsistent. The directions say that when charged, the lights on the earbuds will go from red to off, but every time they went off and I removed them for a second and put them right back, they would remain red. So are they charged or not? Very confusing. Also, when using the buds, the lights weren’t always the color they should be. For example, the dominant bud (Right) should continuously blink fast (blue and red) but sometimes it would just be red.
The battery/charger case....The charging case has 4 blue lights that, when charged, should be all solid. However, after fully charging the case, I used the earbuds for a short time then put them back and no light came on at all. So I’m not sure if the case was charged or not. I found myself spending way too much time being on “light patrol”. Crazy.

Final thoughts, it’s possible that the earbuds that were sent to me were defective, and if this is the case, I would be very willing to try another one. I really wish it worked! I guess if you are looking to just have great music quality then you will be very happy you are willing to put up with the dodgy battery.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lasted during my 6hr flight,"This is my first set of wireless earbuds, so i completely went off of former reviews when i decided to make this purchase. I do not have any regrets. I travel quite a bit and they are convenient for airplane travel. I was able to use them during my most recent 6hr flight and they lasted the entire flight before they announced in my ear that it needed to be charged. I am pleased with them thus far and for the price point I honestly cannot complain.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
T10 compared to T8,"T10-
-Great sound
-Very waterproof

T8
-decent sound
-very light

The T8 has a 90 degree design compared to the T10 130ish degree  design.  The T8 stays In my ear better but you can cram the T10 in a lot deeper so you can really hear that superior sound quality.
The T10 seem about twice as massive as the T8, while still being nearly the same actually size.  Obviously the larger elements require bigger batteries and they’ve crammed all that in a ultra compact size.  This extra weigh sometimes make the T10 feel less natural then the T8

Overall the T10 is far superior, yet has its own flaws.  I would only recommend the T10 over the T8 if your interested in the high waterproof rating or deeper bass capabilities.

—Update—

After a few weeks I’ve noticed a few other things

The T10 battery warning voice plays layered over the input audio, rather then completely coving the audio like the T8 does.  This is great because you don’t miss any of your audio.  I really like this upgraded feature.

The T10 magnetic case is great because the ear buds don’t turn on until you take them out of the case, unlike the T8 that turn in as soon as you open the lid, which causes them to try to connect to each other.  This was an inconvenience for me since I often use only one bud at a time.

And since I only use one bud at a time, The (R) and (L) decal on each are essential for knowing which channel im trying to connect.  The T8 has some low quality ink that rubs off within a few weeks.  The T10 is completely different and will not rub off.  Much better

Battery life of both sets is not great, but it’s definitely what one should expect with such a small unit.  Just Keep the case charged and handy and it’s not a big deal.

I seem to always have trouble with the left channel not wanting to connect after a few months of use, But considering that these cost about the same as a set of premium wired earbuds (that I seem to always destroy with in a week) I’m pretty happy with the longevity of these.

I still stand by My original recommendation.  The T8 is good enough for most, but the T10 is arguably better",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy to use & wonderful sound quality,"The earbuds were very easy to use and pair with my iPhone. After you pair the right earbud the first time, it’ll auto-pair both earbuds to your phone every time you take it out of the case.
If you want you can even use just one earbud at a time.

As for the sound quality, the bass is amazing!  I mainly chose this brand for the sound quality reviews, the price and the fact that it’s waterproof in case I drop it in water. I haven’t tried it in the shower yet, but I’m planning on using it while relaxing in the bathtub and by the pool or seaside.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for the price.,"I bought these looking for a cheaper set of true wireless headphones with decent sound quality. I read a few reviews and decided to try these out. I have not been disappointed. Most of the use has been with my laptop listening to music while studying and they do the job well. The sound quality is impressive for such small earbuds and they are fairly comfortable to wear for a couple of hours at a time. The quality is good, the buds themselves feel solidly put together and the case is magnetic so when you place the buds inside they snap into place and begin charging and the lid is also magnetic so it stays closed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Beeps if both headphones aren't connected,I wanted to be able to use just one side at a time while at work but these beep for several minutes until I connect the second ear bud. Sometimes sound cuts out of the left ear bud. If i charge the whole set and unplug it overnight the charge drains by the time I wake up. I always seem to be charging it.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"High convenience, low fidelity","Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated these headphones crackle/crunch during intense parts of music at any volume when connected to my S7 Edge. The bass is nice and the convenience can't be beat but I would not recommend these headphones for anyone interested in high fidelity music playback. Also I have to keep my phone in my right pocket or they constantly drop and regain signal. I think if you bought them at the lightning deal price (which they seem to hit every week or two) you'd likely be pleased with them. I made the mistake of buying them at full price on impulse and am regretting it. If you aren't dissuaded by the sound quality and connection issues at least add them to your wish list and wait for the notification of the lightning deal.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Really great Headphones, Perfect for motorcycling & working out","First off, they're light and compact. They come with several earbud sizes (standard practice I know) and I found the small ones fit nice and snug in my ear canal. They appear to be watertight and sealed, time will tell of course but first impressions are these will not succumb to sweaty workouts any time soon.

I also tried them out on my motorcycle last weekend, and they fit comfortably inside my helmet. Very good sound on the open highway. I would note though that the headphones do not fit flush against my ear (understandable) so they do get pulled out when taking my helmet off. That's a small gripe though overall.

Finally, the little charging station they come with is also very slick and can be charged via wireless charger.

Overall, $50 well spent, especially if you don't feel like making Sony any richer than they already are.  I highly recommend. =)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value for money,"I use this for music and podcasts. It has been working well with my Samsung phone. The charging case is not the slimmest, but is still small enough to fit in a jacket pocket so I can charge the earbuds when they're not in use. The earbuds get the job done and are a lot more convenient than wired earbuds. Great value for the price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The replacement pair worked so much better!,"My first pair was defective, it would constantly beep even when it was paired. But that’s why i love amazon...i just click on replace and the replacement pair was on its way, even before i sent the original back! I’m glad i let them replace them instead of attempting a new brand. This replacement pair is AMAZING.

Pros:
-The bass is so different from my original pair! The sound is BEAUTIFUL! I’m a hip hop girl, so bass is so important for me. I also listen to all my chemistry/organic chem lectures on my earbuds so i need different tones from my buds. These are great!!
-The small ear pads fit my tiny ears perfectly. I’m glad to see these companies trying to include us small eared customers in their concerns. The airbuds that apple makes are way too big for me. These get right up in my ear and give you the whole experience of the quality of these buds!

Cons:
-Battery life is not so great. When i use these for my school work they don’t last long enough. However, all of the wireless earbud manufacturers all have similar battery life. So it’s a problem as a whole, when buying wireless buds. Unfortunately i cannot wear wired earbuds because i also use them when I’m scrubbed in for surgery so i can’t have wires hanging out of my head. It’s a sacrifice i will have to make.
-The manual is so short and isn’t well written. Your best bet is to find YouTube videos if you need to adjust any settings.
-charger cord is SHORT. So if your outlets are on the floor or wall, the cord will be way too short for you. If you’re going to use your laptop or a battery-pack for charging then you’ll be fine.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Disappointing, even for the price","Pro
-Low cost

Con
 -Sound quality is pretty bad
 -Case will ONLY charge with a 0.5a USB port. Does not work with most standard charging blocks
 -Case and earbuds will not charge simultaneously. You need to charge the case, then the earbuds
 - Can’t find quite the right fit for them to stay in the ear
 - Microphone picks up too much background noise and is unusable outdoors with even the lightest wind

Conclusion
- Wanted to like them, but it was a waste of time and money",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic value...great performance vs low price,"Absolutely a fantastic value.  The earbuds are comfortable, extremely convenient and sound fantastic.  Definitely worth every penny.  I often use them while mowing the lawn and they are perfect.  They cancel most of the noise from my tractor and sound great.  Couple that with the fact that they are much lighter and cooler than my Parrot Zik over the ear headphones that I used to use, and they are a winner.  If you are looking for a set of earbuds, do yourself a favor and pick these up.  A great value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound d but doesn’t auto-reconnect to phone.,"Great sound quality and build. Unfortunately they don’t seem to pair automatically with my iPhone XS. I’ve owned several different Bluetooth headsets and earbuds and this is the first that doesn’t automatically connect to the phone after the initial pairing. I have to go into the Settings app on the phone and click the Tozo T10 under Bluetooth 90-95% of the time. Initially I thought this was how the product was designed, but once in a while it does connect. I did try forgetting the headset and re-pairing but same deal. The sound quality is great and the Qi charging case is also great. Battery life seems fine.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality,"These are great. As many other reviewers have said, I must have small ears because most ear buds fall out. These are nice because they have the different sizes. When running, I still had to adjust them from time to time, but they fit pretty well. The sound is great. They can be quite noise-cancelling if sitting still, but they fit so snugly, then when running, the sounds travels mechanically through so you can hear your feet hitting the ground. I just didn't put them in quite so snug, which is probably why I had to adjust them from time to time.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely LOVE them.,"I have had these headphones for about a little over a month now. I love them. I've used them in the pool, shower, around the house, and on the go. They last a long time and can switch out. Both buds link to the phone both separately and together. I use one at a time and switch them out when one dies. The only thing that I would improve is the microphone. When on the phone with them my husband has mentioned he has a hard time hearing me sometimes. But I absolutely love the product and would definitely recommend them.

Amazing Buds,"I. LOVE. THESE. EARBUDS. Not to mention they will save my marriage...kinda kidding about that, but they'll help. My wife and I share an office and she's easily distracted by sounds, so if I have to listen to something on my computer, she complains. I've been through a number of headphones,earbuds, etc., but none have been as comfortable and reliable and barely noticeable as the TOZO T10s. They're fantastic. Great sound, very good noise cancelling, but not enough to not let me hear my wife if she has a question, and so comfortable I almost don't notice they're in. Plus, they're easy to connect. I keep them right on my desk in their convenient holder. Can't think of anything I'd change. They're great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Sound Quality,"I was initially very impressed when I received these headphones. They paired quickly and the sound quality was better than expected. The soft tips act like an insulator and do a good job of cancelling outside noise. I also purchased the wireless charging mat from Tozo, and I'm happy with how the two items work together.

Updated after 3 months: Wireless charger bribe for 5 ⭐.  Does the job.,"Updated after 3 months: You might wonder why this has so many 5 🌟 reviews. The seller emails after you buy for a bribe wireless charger for 5 star 🌟 review. Who doesn't want free.

Now to the ear buds. It's not fantastic, not bad either.

- Comfortable and does not fall off.
- Negative: Blue tooth pairing never pairs automatically. I always every time have to click on my saved TOZO T10 to pair. I tried everything according to instructions and reviews. Doesn't pair automatically. I use a note 8. My Jay bird and anker pairs automatically without problem.
- Magnetic case is good and comfortable to fit in pocket.
- I have no idea of turning it off yet. No power off button legible to know. Let me know if you find out.
- Holds charge for moderate use. Won't be an issue.
- Call: Does the job. Caller mentioned doesn't have a huge disturbance.
- Music: Quality is good. Good bass and loudness. I like this.
- Negative:  Having said that the connection is poor. The song drops off so many times with your phone just in your pocket. I have to keep it behind pocket for better connection. This is 2019 and this is what is in this product. Bluetooth connection should be good without interruption for at least couple feet.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Constantly drops connection,"I have owned these for a little over a month now, using them for phone calls, meetings, and music from my laptop and iPhone.  On the PC they constantly drop audio and I have to swap output devices in and out to get them to restore audio.  On both the iPhone and the PC the left channel is very unstable, sometimes I will go 30 minutes solid, other times it just constantly looses connection cutting in and out.  Over sound is good, as is the battery life, but the connection issues make these a no go, if I was still in return window these would be going back.  As it is I am going to have to buy something else because these are just not usable.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Careful if you shower with them.,"Expected a wireless earbud device that could operate in both stereo and mono. Unfortunately it is not the case. If you turn on one ear bud they both turn on. For my particular work, that is a deal breaker.

What I did experience? They pair together very quickly. I assume with the ipx7 they can handle moderate water. I would not try to swim with these buds. Might be able to survive short submersion in water. But they will have to dry out for optimal audio quality.

Also expect maybe 4-8 weeks of usefulness if you do subject them to water. Great that Amazon has a good return policy.

Edit : the company has fantastic customer support. They got in touch and fixed my problem. 3 stars easily becomes 5.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO BLUETOOTH Review,I have really enjoyed this product since I have received it. The nosies quality is excellent and the battery life can last for the whole day. The only issue I’ve had with this product is sometimes when wearing the head phones it seems like there are certain dead spots when listening to things. I find that the left headphone flickers in and out with the sound. I never have the device it’s connected to to further than the instructions specify but the headphone always seems to flick out.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality but bad pairing,"I got this headphones for hands free calling. They work great for listening to music or audio but the pairing has been a nightmare. Sounds quality is good and so is the battery life. I gave two stars because the pairing is the hardest part. Here are my general issues:

1. Auto pairing with phone: I was not able to connect these automatically to my phone. Sometimes, I paid one headset auto and then have to restart the headset to pair both. It requires me to turn off Bluetooth and then turn back on.

2. Pairing both headset: pairing both headset is a nightmare. I had to restart both headset multiple times to pair both headset. Then something times I have to restart the headset to make it work.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds,"Great earbuds!  The fit is very secure, the noise canceling is a welcome addition compared to my last pair of earbuds.  The battery life on the earbuds is fantastic and the charging case is wonderful.  I have recommended these to my friends and co-workers.  A great price for a great pair of earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Too expensive for what they provide,"Tl;Dr: With the static, bulky size in the ear, average sound quality, but surprisingly good bass, these should be at MOST $35, not $50.

I have read elsewhere that Tozo offers customers a free wireless charging pad in exchange for a 5-star review. I have not received this offer since getting the earphones a day ago, but I think this is a terrible practice that should be stopped by Amazon (but I know it won't).

These earphones are okay. They take about 15 seconds from the moment I take them out from their case to pairing to my phone. Sound quality is lacking, with lots of white noise at all levels of volume. This is mostly okay for me for what I mostly plan to use them for (riding on my motorcycle and working out). I have not used these to run or do other workouts yet. While riding my motorcycle to work today, I had just the right earphone in inside my helmet and it did a pretty good job of canceling wind noise and I could hear my music clearly. The bass is actually pretty good! I produce audiobooks occasionally and while it is not V-MODA or Bose quality bass, it gives a nice depth to music and podcasts. In a quiet environment, phone call quality is also surprisingly clear on both ends. However, you can only use the right earphone during calls.

They're kind of bulky. This doesn't affect the sound quality, but it does make it a bit harder to stay in the ear. Even when doing nothing, I find myself adjusting them often. I will continue to experiment with the other sizes provided. I cannot comment on battery life yet, but I will update when I decide it is good or bad.

Overall, there are better options. I will keep these for another week, and if I find any more problems, I will likely return them and get something else.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Perfect first wireless ear buds that aren't too expensive!,"These are my first pair of wireless ear buds. I wear them at work and I bought them after I got annoyed having to take out my headphones every time I got up from my desk because I had to keep my phone plugged in. Don't get a new phone, get new ear buds.

My son picked these out for me because he saw that I struggled with less tactic ear buds.

The setup took 15 seconds as I was able to pair my iPhone X to the earbuds without any problem. The sound quality was better than my Beats By Dre Earbuds!

Oh so close to perfection!,"So I wanted desperately to be able to give these a 5 star. And I would have if it wasn't for the bit of lag you get between the moving mouths in the video and then the actual words you hear in the ear buds. It's minor - and if you're exercising and not focusing on the screen, you won't notice. But if you're on a treadmill and you're watching TV to distract because let's face it, us normal people are dying while we're exercising and that tiny screen is the only bit of distracting I have from sheer passing out - it's hard to stay focused on living when I can see the lips moving then hear the sound seconds later. So I wish I could figure it out - I wish I could have a pair that works maybe better. Because then I would so give these a 5 star because they sound amazing and fit perfectly. Best fit of a pair of ear buds ever. And I LOVE the look. :(",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality earbuds for a great price,"So far the ear buds work very well. Pairing is indeed very simple. You pair with the Right side since that is the main one, and when you take it out of the charging box, it'll pair up automatically with each other.

Battery life is really good and the charging case is super convenient. The case is also qi-wireless charging compatible which is super useful and you don't have to deal with wires. It also has neat magnetic lid and place for the ear buds that snap the buds into place with ease. The battery life on the earbuds are long enough for most regular usage (3+ hours) where you don't have to hassle with charging every time.

Sound quality is quite good. The bass is a lot stronger than other earbuds I've had and the music is clear though it.

prettty good. Me quedo satisfecho.,"Battery life is really top notch.
A lot more base than I expected.
If the earbuds keep falling out, try on a different bud size and remember to twist them backwards once they’re in your ear 👍
Sometimes the earbuds will come a bit loose when running and some noise canceling ability is lost when the seal is broken between the the bud and your ear if that makes sense...just re-adjust them.
Overall great build quality and the case is top notch. Would buy again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them,So far they are great. No problems. Very easy to connect and I love the wireless charging. They sound great and look nice in my ears. Was a great buy and great price,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value. Wish battery life was more than 3.5,Had these for almost a year now. Battery life is right at 3.5 when I’m watching movies. Wish it was closer to 5 like AirPods but at the price difference you could buy 2 and swap them out to charge and still have money left. I have small ear canals and these fit great and my ears aren’t sore after. I have another set from another brand and those won’t pair well. Glad I went with these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality Not Reliable,"I liked these earbuds just ok- sometimes they worked AMAZINGLY with great sound quality and no cuts/drop outs with the connection. Other times, it sounded almost like a radio static in the background and bluetooth connection would cut in and out so often I couldn't make it through a song without multiple interruptions. So when they were functioning properly, they were pretty great, but they weren't reliable. Also, there is no volume control to the earbuds themselves and the lowest volume setting was louder than I'd like sometimes for working in quiet spaces like the office. Ultimately I returned these ear buds because they were not reliable.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best True Wireless Earbuds For The Gym,"I have been using various ""wireless"" earbuds for the past 2-years, primarily for use in the gym and subways. Since my gym sessions last between 2-3 hours each day, I can get pretty sweaty and need wireless buds that will not get affected by the moisture; they also need to be comfortable and stay in place while running and doing various exercises. I have been using the TOZO T10s for a couple of weeks now and they have been absolutely amazing! I use the largest of the three bud sizes and they fit perfectly and never feel as though they will fall out - even when running for an hour. The sound quality is great for wireless earbuds; they have great base and range, and sound good playing whichever genre of music I select (rap, hip-hop, rock, metal, etc.). The case is also very durable and charges the earbuds when not in use (just don't forget to charge the case!). The earbuds pair almost immediately when taken out of the case - to each other and to my phone.

Since I have only been using them for a couple of weeks, I will update my review after a couple of months to see how they have held up with a few hours of daily use. Lastly, while not apart of this product specifically, TOZO has offered to send me a wireless charging pad for free to be used with the earbuds (and any other wireless charging devices I have). I will update my review to include the wireless charging pad and charging capabilities/speed of the case.

Update: The earbuds have been holding up very well and I have not had any issues with them. They have been used daily for 2-3 hours (sometimes more if I was on a business trip and used them on the plane). The free wireless charger that TOZO sent over works great as well and goes well with the earbuds. After all that I have put these earbuds through, I can confidently recommend them to others!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10 Absolutely a great set of wireless earbuds,"Out of the case the earbuds paired. Sound although not super lood is fantastic. Good bass, mids & highs are very good.
Do not have and can't compare with higher priced sets but these definitely do a great job for me. Have compared with similar priced earbuds and these surpass by far others tried.
Pros: Solid connection, terrific solid overall sound, nicely made, light weight & comfort.
Cons: none
Suggestions: Congratulations. Keep making outstanding products",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound..Case serves as charger!,"I just received the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds a few days ago. I really like how the case also serves as a charger. These headphones are super easy to pair..they automatically pair to each other when removed from their case, and linked quickly to my Bluetooth device. The instructions are clear to state you link the Right earbud to your Bluetooth device, this is important to note as both the Left and Right earbud show up as linkable to your Bluetooth. I have not used the microphone capability as of yet, however, another family member purchased these and uses them frequently for phone calls. I have found these earbuds to be great at canceling out noise and they arrive with several optional size ear pieces to choose for comfort. They sound great, are very light and comfortable to wear.. overall a great purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Nice Concept, Needs Improvement","Battery life isn't great. Has problems sometimes coming in and out of connectivity when outside not sure if it's impacted by other bluetooth tech nearby. I use them everyday at work, it's just 1/2 way through my day I have to switch with other wireless earphones so they can recharge. The phone feature seems to work well, others do not have issues hearing me when I'm speaking during a call.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Will not hold a charge,I sent back the first pair because the left ear bud would not hold a charge.  As soon as I put it in my ear i heard a beeping for low battery.  I got a replacement and now neither one will hold a charge.  I wanted them to work because the sound quality was excellent and they were comfortable.  Unfortunately I need to send these back.  I won’t be replacing them with the same thing.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product, one note.","This is a great pair of wireless buds and is amazing for the price. Definitely waterproof and last for hours. The case recharges it a couple times as well. More than enough time for an entire vacation trip.

An important fact though, almost all true wireless buds (no wire in between them) use a master/slave bud interface which is susceptible to signal interference. In simple words, at certain angles and placements, your phones signal may disrupt connection in the left bud momentarily. That is not a manufacturing error or problem with the product. It is a limitation of the technology that all true wireless buds have.

Overall though, the interference is not usually noticed and is a wonderful product that works amazingly for such a good price.

Great buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Thumbs down,After giving these things multiple chances I have to give them a thumbs down. Call quality is horrible but sound quality is good. So I thought I would just use them for music and podcasts. Sound keeps jumping from one ear to the other repeatedly. Will drive you nuts. I really wanted to use these but just can't. Customer service is excellent but Earbuds need work.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, perfect for running!","Excellent sound quality, I am actually surprised at the depth of the bass and the full range of sound, pairing was super easy, paired immediately with each other and iPhone XS. Very light, fit ears well, and very comfortable. I use them for running and they are very secure. I have not experienced cutting in and out, works great. Highly recommended!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product no problems thus far,"Had this a week, in the last year burned through a dozen various models with something I didn’t like or they died. This one is fine although not tested near water as of yet. My second product from these guys both working fine.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tl;dr version: BUY THEM!,"First let me say I paid for these, this is an honest review after having them a week. Now down to business...
My bf has a different brand that is popular here and they are pretty decent. I decided to get these over the very expensive “fruit” brand. We wanted to see which ones were better. I think I won with these. I’ve been really impressed with them.

They had a nice charge straight out of the box. The packaging was spot on, and had a nice feel to it. 5/5 on presentation. If it will let me upload pics I will share them.

The case had 3 bars and each earbud was charged. It is plastic, but not flimsy. I turned it upside and shook it while open and the earbuds did not fall out. The magnet is fairly strong.

Pairing was insanely simple. There’s a voice that notifies you when they are connected. You can one or both. The mic is in the right so you won’t be able to answer a call with just the left in.

It comes with a lanyard that makes it easy to handle. My hands sometimes don’t work, and I dropped the case within five minutes. Luckily the lanyard was around my wrist and they didn’t hit the floor.

It has multiple sized ear buds and that was super handy. The smallest one fit my ears comfortably.

It comes with a short charging cable as well as being able to sit it on my wireless charging pad. That was the first charge I did, and it works beautifully.

Initially they were a bit uncomfortable, but that’s probably me. My ears aren’t used to noise cancelling earbuds. The fit is very snug so that they don’t fall out.

Noise cancelling... really impressed. I had to take these out to hear people talk at a normal level. It is not 100% silent, but I’m good with that. I think for safety reasons I prefer to hear a bit of background noise.

Call quality... not bad. Not perfect. My BF has a hard time hearing me at times because I’m rather soft spoken, so he had to have me repeat what I said several times. If I could give it a 3.5 I would but I rounded up instead of down because the call was clear. You must remember these are tiny tiny speakers and mics in a waterproof housing for under $50 they will NOT be the quality of “$200 fruit”. They are Great for their price point.

Music/sound quality... wow!! I am super impressed with how they sound when listening to music. I see a few negatives about the Bass, but I thought it was fine. This isn’t a home entertainment system, it’s an earbud. A tiny speaker. Be logical. It’s not not going to thump like it’s in a high school parking lot.

I. WORE. THEM. IN. A. POOL. BOOM! Excellent!
Look, I was skeptical, and saved the packaging to send them back when they died today from not being waterproof. They get the last laugh on me because they are perfectly fine today. I thought if the water didn’t hurt them the heat would. It was 104 F according to my car thermostat. I swam floated splashed and played for 4 hours in the water. They will cut off when you get under water because the signal is interrupted. Bluetooth doesn’t go through water. My phone was appx 15-20 feet away in a leather bag, and I only had a few temporary losses of signal. No big deal.

Is there anything bad?
Well, maybe. It may be user error, so I hate to say it’s the product.
When I have left them to charge and the red light signaling they are charged goes off, they aren’t always fully charged. They will beep in my ear after pairing indicating a low battery. So I have resorted to picking them both up to activate them then dropping them back in to stay charged.

 If I’m doing something wrong I’d appreciate any feedback from the company or a knowledgeable user. Thanks.

Conclusion: worth the expense... I’ll be buying another pair, I guess, because my kid wants some. :D",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My best find on amazon in recent times,"I wanted to try this new trend of the wireless ear buds that's going on right now, so I searched online and found two suggestions mostly Pasonomi and Tozo, as the battery life was better I went with pasonomi first but the sound quality of those ear buds was totally plain, no bass but plain voices, no wonder the battery life is so much. I love bass, so I tried these, and these are great ! the bass on these buds is amazing and I am very happy with these! I don't worry about battery life too, as I get nearly 4 full charges in a single go for the case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Product, Sound and Battery Life! A++","These earbuds are perfect for any application. I am very pleased to have purchased them. We began working out at the gym and needed a truly wireless feature to listen to music. Ordered two pairs, one for me and the other for my son.

Pros on this item:

Great Sound, Lightweight, Fit and sit nicely in ear, don't fall out even when running, Instant connection to device and you can use both earbuds or just one. Wireless charging for the pack and multiple charges if you plan on using them for a while or are away from power source. and Yes hey are truly waterproof!
-During a job painting one earbud fell completely into paint can, was completely submerged. Simply rinsed with water and still working. Son confirmed that they also work in the shower!

We have had them several weeks without fail and they work flawlessly every time. The company also offers one year warranty.

Cons on this item:

There is really only one negative I have for this item, and that is that it didn't offer to have a different color option. We purchased two pair and it would be great if we could have purchased different colors. If you do end up offering different colors please inform.

Final Note:

5 stars because of the great quality, flawless connectivity, ease of use, freedom of application such as work, gym, running, and being able to use one or the other at times. The fact that there was no color option doesn't change my 5 start rating. The company also followed up to see if we had been satisfied with the product and sent a complimentary gift afterwords. Thank you A+++",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The quality and simplicity will surprise you.,"I got my TOZO T-10 ear buds for running and I can tell you they did not disappoint me.  The sound is much better than my previous ear buds, the fit is very comfortable.  The variety of sizes made finding a good fit very easy.

All in all, a great product you will not regret.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
LOVE THEM AND THE CASE,"Ordered two pairs, fit and work great - they come with 4 different earbud sizes which makes a big difference since I am small and the pair for my husband is large. Wireless charger makes everything easy. I put the wireless charger by the treadmill and they are always ready to go. I love the case too - grab and go when we jump on the boat for two more charge rounds. Small and I wanted the white, looks good in the ear and not so big and obvious. I am going to order one more pair for my assistant.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You should seriously buy them!,"I love these ear buds. They are amazing. The only issue I have with them is you can't use just one at a time. They both have to be out of the case and turned on, otherwise it beeps over whatever you're listening to. Other than that, I would buy these again and again. The charge lasts so long. They've never died on me, but do keep in mind that I always place them back in the case when I'm done with them. The case stays charged for a few days at minimum.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great earbuds, especially for the price!","Probably one of the best pair of earbuds I have bought so far, especially for the price. These sound just as good as Apple’s AirPods but they fit my ears better, and they are way less expensive.

My only con with these is that I wish the battery life was longer, but they do charge back up fast with the charging case.

Overall, a very good buy!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Outstanding overall, and particularly recommended for bass lovers","So I received the TOZO T10’s a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve had lots of time to listen to them. The packaging was very solid, as is their construction. I had to do some adjusting to make sure that I had a good fit (this is of course critical with any earbud-type earphones). Once in place, they feel more comfortable than one would expect. The sound is excellent. Note of course that they aren’t flat-graphically equalized, but actually solidly bass-boosted as most music listeners gravitate towards. The bass is quite deep and rich — boosted noticeably near the mid-bass range in particular, and therefore ideal for anyone who loves good, substantial bass. The mid-range is pretty good and the highs are pretty reasonable as well. The maximum volume is substantially louder than any earphones I’ve ever listened to. I’d also say the clarity is pretty good, not perfect, but quite good—the thing to remember is that Bluetooth in general tends to be relatively lacking in clarity when compared to wired earphones. Even though I haven’t listened to every other brand of earphones (though I have heard many) the TOZO T10’s would have to be, by far, the best in their class.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good quality sound, noise cancellation, okay battery life.","The bass is impressive, and the sound quality is good. The earphones fit snugly in my ears, and the noise cancelling effect is decent for in-ear headphones. For the battery life: after a full charge these headphones died in about 4-5 hours. The portable charger allows you to recharge them on the go, which is neat, but I haven't tried it yet because it's a bit too nu wave for me, and what am I supposed to do? Put the charger in my pocket? Okay.

Other notes: Sometimes I forget that they are even in my ears, until I get an itch and I remove one of them to itch my ear, and that gives me a chuckle.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Customer Service and Shower proof,"These earbuds are great quality for the price. These are by far my favorite earbuds in this price range, other brands to not offer the deep base and ""showerproofness"" lol ; there are many times I am relieved that I can use my earbuds in the shower.

Overall, if you don't want to spend too much money on true wireless headphones, I recommend you to buy this one. In the last 2 years I bought about 4 wireless earbuds, and this one is the best so far.

Left earbud kept disconnecting,"Ended up sending these back. Worked fine initially then the left earpiece would constantly disconnect if I moved my head. If I stared straight ahead or left my finger on the earbud it would work. Tried all the resetting processes but it continued to disconnect with any head movement. I guess I got unlucky as there are a large number of good reviews for this particular product, occasionally someone will get a dud...I guess that was me this time.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Work very well once they connect - had to work to get them fitted properly,"I really like these and had to play with the different sized ear buds and once I gotten these fitted I was able to get much better sound, initially I thought they sounded to brassy and were lack luster on the base end of the spectrum.  Every once in a while I have to put them back in the case and then pull them one at a time out of the case as a process to get them to attach to my devices.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bluetooth headphones at this price range,"I have bought 3 bluetooth headphones over the last year. This pair is by far the best at this price range. The first pair I purchased would lose charge in my pocket without use after 1 day. Pretty inconvenient.

The next se I purchased were ""Beats"" style and while the sound was good, they werent that good for working out in and after about a month the spaeaker in the right ear came loose so that was kinda a bummer.

These headphones though, so far, have great sound and play for over an hour on one charge.(probably longer,  I just havent used them for longer than that.) I have only had a week but so far so good.

Using the buds is very intuitive--take them out and they pair to your device and put them back in the case to charge and it disconnects.  They charge quickly.

Great for music on the go as well as movies/videos if you want to watch quietly.

No issues with them falling out; they fit snugly when one adheres to the insertion diagram.

Other than that it is pretty good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds!,"This is the second set of wireless earbuds that I have purchased and the first from this company.

The first thing that I noticed was the sturdy ness of the case. The case is solid, protecting the earbuds. My previous set were docked in a case with no lid and I kept them in my truck. If I had to stop suddenly and the case would shift from where I had it the earbuds would come out of the case and I would find myself search for them on the floor of the truck.

I also like that this case holds a charge apart from having it plugged in so there is no need to have it connected in the truck ( my primary use of these buds is when I am at the gym or driving).

I also appreciate that they are waterproof as there are times I sweat quite a bit in the gym and it relieves the worry of one dropping in the sink.

The sound quality is solid. I get great clarity regardless of what I am using them for: music or conversation.

Although I did not need them, this unit has four different sizes to accommodate your ear.

For the price, they are phenomenal!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for the price and excellent customer service,"These headphones offer a high quality performance, especially in the context of how cheap they are. All their features work as advertised (bluetooth, waterproof) and sound quality is very good. There is a decent amount of passive noise cancellation due to the seal it makes with your ears. Battery life is 3-4 hours and with the case, i can usually get 1-2 days of listening out of it. Furthermore, their customer service is excellent.

Poor battery life and fit,"These are of an okay quality. The sound quality is just good, albeit a little grainy with heavy music. Batty life is also very short, only around 3-4 hours of active listening. This may seem sufficient but for a commuter, it's a nuisance having to recharge so frequently. They also don't fit comfortably in the ear, and are prone to slipping out (not suitable to the  gym). I've tried multiple sizes for the rubber and the earphones still fall out, sometimes in the middle of the street. The left earbud also chips out at random times, even when I'm being sedentary. That being said, these are not terrible earphones. The small size makes them very portable. If you want average sound quality and don't care about connectivity or battery life, these may be right for you. I will be returning as I don't believe they are worth the price.

Quality,"Overall a pretty darn good set of headphones for the price. Some things you lose out on - range isn’t quite as good, and you can’t listen with just one at a time while recharging the other. Also of minor note: low battery warning gives you about 30 seconds before they cut off, and they have an obnoxious pairing vocalization - both sides announce 2-3 things over top of each other, all basically just saying it’s connected.

All of that considered, I’ve give them 5 stars. Certainly not as good as AirPods, but they have some features AirPods don’t, and they’re 1/4 the cost. What causes these to lose 2 stars is that I’m 2 days past my return period and they’re already pealing in terms of the coating on one of them. Granted I’ve been using them - in water and while working out - my I got these for those purposes, and if they’re only going to last you a might, but just skip getting your hopes up for a product that will ultimately not deliver.

If I’m wrong about this and somehow just got a bad batch, I’d be happy to reconsider if the seller were to show me I’m wrong.

UPDATE: Tozo provided great customer service and sent a replacement earbud, along with prompt follow-ups via email. While I'd still recommend being a bit more careful than I'd like to have to be, this is a great product and earns 5 stars.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very poor sound quality,"The sound quality is TERRIBLE from these. The sound is quite tinny and sort of resembles a voice call where the receiver is shouting into a phone on speaker phone.

I have a problem with these where the left earbuds cuts off very often. Pretty much whenever I look to the right even though my phone (Galaxy S10) is in my left pocket.

Not the best fit.,"These would be really great, except for the fact that they fall out of my ears constantly.

I like the sound quality, and how they fit in a neat little charging case. I like the battery life and their general utility. The thing I don’t like, is how they always fall out of my ears while I work out. I can hardly wear them on runs because they fit so loosely in my head that they fall out just from running.  I followed the directions and tried using every earbud combination that came in the box and settled on the smallest ones. That worked fine for the left side but not the right.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can't get buds to stay in my ear. Unless purchasing other supplement buds.,"Great sound. My only issue is that they loosen which causes a huge reduction in base and overall quality in sound. A lot of the times they just fall out of my ear. I have tried every size option, and twisting method as directed my the manual to no avail. Great sound but useless if they don't stay in my ear.

Update: Purchasing these ears buds allows the TOZO to stay in my ear, bumping to 4 stars. Forgot to mention, it is not good for calls, just music. Below is the link for where i bought the buds. The Thimble type worked the best for me.

"Really Bad headphones.. keep disconnecting, beware.","I bought them a month ago, to be precise, around 32 days ago. I was busy and did not use them but last week when i started using them. they keep disconnecting, i thought it was because of the new ios i installed. then i reverted my ios it still keep disconnecting, i even tried with my wifes' phone, same results, I called Amazon support but they cant return it now as its more then 30 days (32 days). So i stuck with these disconnecting ones. Beware.... Hope this helps for your buy.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quite Impressed - Great Buy,"Having bought a pair of ear pods, which required me to crank the music all the way up so I could hear it while mowing the lawn was ridiculous. That, coupled with the fact that they did not stay in my ears, made me wonder what the big deal was.
I was so dissatisfied, I quickly purchased a pair of TOZO T10. WOW. These are so different (in a good way).
The battery life is great; the noise cancelling feature works so well, that as I mow my lawn, I can only put the music up less than halfway.
I highly recommend these little gems.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound while on the phone, and listening to music!","These are great headphones, especially for the price! Bluetooth is great, and the sound quality is great. I can mow my lawn, and barely hear the mower over my music. Pairing is super easy, and happens very quick when taking them out of the charing case, or turning them on. Definitely a great buy!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent -if you don't need a microphone,"The device itself, as headphones works great. The build quality is nice with a soft rubber finish. Being able to wireless-charge the buds with the case is a convenient feature. These fit me well and remain in place. These are also good at isolating you from outside noise.

A major annoyance: I don't think you can use these in mono mode. The right bud will beep every 10 seconds or so if used alone. I think if you pull out the left bud, let it connect and replace it back in the case, the right bud will beep for 20 seconds (once per 10s interval) and then it seems to stop. An annoyance, but still a 5-star product at this point.

The reason for the 1 star review:  the microphone is completely useless. It's not even sub-par or low quality. I call my work line using my cell and even with the right bud 2 inches from my mouth, my own voice felt like very low background noise -from far, far away.

I really wanted to like these... but I'll have to return them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WAY too big + poor sound quality,"These earbuds are WAY too big...even when you use the smallest tips and follow the install instructions. If you have small to medium sized ears, these won't work. I'm a 6'1"" (187 cm) man and these earbuds do not fit in my ears. No way I could exercise without them falling out. And the sound quality is not great. There's noticeable background static. I believe most of the positive reviews are fake.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sound great battery life.,I have recently gone through several headphones and I finally decided to try these out. I have been looking at these for probably 2months or so and pull the trigger. I am so happy that I did. They are great!  Plenty of volume with great sound quality. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for good sound with great battery life.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds!!!,I purchased these earbuds after going through two other competing brands that failed after about a week of use.  These are outstanding!  They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  The sound quality is also excellent.  I like the fact they are waterproof also in case I am caught out in the rain or sweating while working out.  Purchase these and you will be very happy!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Happy With My Purchase,These are great quality at an affordable price.  This is the first pair of wireless earbuds I've owned so I have nothing to compare them to but I am very happy so far.  They fit snug and sound great.  They are very easy to set up.  The sound is incredible.  Phone calls are crystal clear.  I can hear who I am talking to without any problem and who I am talking to has no problem hearing me.  I will be buying more for my kids!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor bluetooth signal.,"Worked ok when standing still. When walking around bluetooth signal faded in and out. I keep my phone in a hip case and have no signal loss with previous head sets and no issues with the Aftershock air head see I am currently using.
Highly recommend the Aftershock Air (Bone conduction) head set.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound Horrible Functions & Battery,"I really, really wanted to like these earbuds. To be honest, they are great! The sound is amazing, the bass POPS, and they fit super snug (rare for me because earbuds tend to fall out and I usually end up having to use headphones), but they have NO functions. If I’d known I couldn’t even turn the volume up or down, I never would have bought them... and the battery life is pretty terrible.
If you want a reasonably priced pair of wireless earbuds and don’t care about functions (literally any functions aside from re-dual last number and pause... seriously), these are great. I wish I had looked at the functions before I bought them... I will probably be returning them :(. I really wanted to like them!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome,"I wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones for working out and running and these are great. I have had them for about two months and worn them almost daily, and they are holding up fine. I have even dropped the little charging box on the street, but no damage. They come with different size ear squishies so you can switch them out to be more comfortable if you have small ears. They do not fall out when running, and I have worn them in the shower a couple times so they are waterproof. My only complaint is the bluetooth distance is not very long. Maybe 30 feet from your phone and the headphones start cutting out and become disconnected. I have to take my phone with me to go to the water fountain. But its not too big of an issue to just bring my phone along considering everything else about these headphones are great. Overall recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Product...great value!!!,"Fast delivery and worked great right out of the box.  Excellent packaging and easy to use.  Don't worry about fit....these really stay in my ear better than any others I've tried.

"Sound quality is excellent,  underpriced","Wow best wireless earbuds so far. Use Bose soundsport prior to these and these are so much better in every way.  Much better bass, do not fall out, do not loose connection.  Very happy with this purchase.  Low price but quality is much better than trivoli, beats, or bose.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones when they're not cutting out,"I was so excited about these when I first used them; the sound quality is awesome and has great bass. Even my audiophile husband was impressed. The big problem is that they cut out a LOT. It happens at least twice/session. Sometimes they just stop playing music even if I haven't paused the music or disconnected them. This happens when the headphones are fully charged, so I don't think it's a battery issue.

The phone feature is so-so. Sometimes it works, and people I'm talking to have no trouble hearing me. Other times, they can barely hear me.

I'm giving 3 stars because the sound quality is so good, and I like the wireless charging.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Kinda a letdown,"So the earbuds play music and you can connect them both after finding the left and right bluetooth channels from your phone. BUT they are much bigger than I expected and they won't even stay in my ear. I tried all three size buds they gave me and non of the sizes would comfortably stay in my ear. Also i tried to just listen to one bud and the earbud constantly paused and played, so you cant only have on in at one time. When you charge your earbuds through the case, the earbud's LED light always stays at an orange, so you never know when they're charged.
Obviously returning them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Wireless Earbuds!,"The noise cancellation on these earbuds are awesome. Will buy again if needed in the future.

They also have a great range so leaving your phone/pad on your desk and heading to the kitchen or even outside is viable.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Impressive bass response!,"Man, I was honestly just hoping for some decent quality audio and ok build quality for the price, but what I got was some of the best sounding earbuds I've ever owned, wired or wireless. I changed it the ear pieces for the best fit and they fit very nicely, snug and comfortable and light weight.

I'm also a fan of the carrying case with the 400ma power bank for recharging when you're not near power. I can also take advantage of the wireless charging with my Galaxy s10+ if I'm really desperate.

So far, I'm extremely satisfied with these earbuds. Will update on durability once I've owned them for awhile.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"So far, so good! :-)","These headphones are great! I like the functionality of them. I have not done an intense workout with them to know how well they will stay in my ears during that, but I did a quick, jump heavy, exercise and they were great. The sound quality is awesome too!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for $49,"Volume is not awesome, but quality is good. No music control on earbuds other than play/Pause and call accept/decline. Overall a good deal for $49",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great product with one possible drawback,"Over-all this is a great product. It is super easy to pair, charging is easy and I love that the carrying case can charge it, if you don't have an outlet handy. Everything TOZO says it will do it seems to do. I would have given this 5 stars except for one problem I am having. When I use it while mowing my yard it will periodically loose the connection. It does re-connect but will be very sporadic with maintaining the connection. I'm really not sure why. Perhaps it has something to do with the frequency the mower is running at? All and all I would recommend this product without reservation.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, poor fit","Unfortunately these things just do not stay in my ears if I’m moving around. I’ve tried every different fitting and shoved them into my ear at every different angle, but they always fall out within 5 minutes of walking. If you plan on using them for workouts, it might be a waste of money. Otherwise, the sound quality (especially the bass) is pretty dang good for the price.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very bad and not good product,"I was very disappointed after I bought this product, so I trusted all these reviews.
Do not trust all of these reviews, the goods are not high-quality, cheap plastic, it works poorly, I used them on the phone and the MacBook, the sound disappears, then it is chanted, the headsets do not work simultaneously.
It is extremely difficult to match the size for the ears, they either do not climb or fall out.
They can not be used in the gym.
I am going to return them as this product does not cost $ 50.
I do not recommend",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO is the BEST!!!,"Great sound on the earbuds, and great customer service! There were no problems,
They just sent me an email, offering to send me a wireless charger for free, out off the blue! A friend had recommended these, because they sent him an extra pair for FREE! I didn't believe it. But now I DO! I'm very happy with this purchase. They actually work really well and sound great, so the free stuff is just a bonus!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Awesome sound, great fit, waterproof...","i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable.  For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones.  Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool.  Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going.  But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.  The only negative thing about this buying these is that my husband is impressed as well, so it looks like I will have to buy another pair for him to use while he is out on his kayak.  He isn't getting mine. :-)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awful: It keeps disconnecting itself,"These are the worst wireless headphones; they keep disconnecting themselves. I am listening to something, then the headphones disconnect.

Amazing sound quality and excellent customer service!,"I was highly impressed at the sound quality of these earbuds! Great noise cancellation, great bass, and all around great sound! The bluetooth range is highly impressive as well. I am most impressed by the battery life, at 4 to 5 hours of listen time and approximately an hour for a full charge. The battery pack can charge the earbuds 3 to 4 times before it needs to charged too, which is much better than I anticipated.
I also need to add what wonderful customer service I recieved from the company! I accidentally put one headphone in the washer with my jeans, for about 5 minutes, and the headphone broke. The company was more than happy to issue me a replacement pair, no hassle and no run around! I highly recommend these earbuds and this company. Five stars isnt enough!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice Suprise,"My Bing's stop working and was shopping for earbuds recently. I found these Tozos on Amazon and decided to give hem a try. I have to say I'm very happy I did. The quality and feel of this product feel well made. These were also reasonably priced versus the alternatives. They sound great and come with a hard case and charging cable. I was able to sync them to my phone with no problem. If your looking for earbuds, I would definitely would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy set up,"This is such cool technology and I am usually not very proficient at setting up new electronics. Was a snap and they really sound great. The fact that they come with several sizes of ear caps is a definite plus. The earplugs that came with my iPhone never stay secure. Being able to pick the correct size is a wonderful feature. All in all, I am happy with my purchase of Tozo T10 earbuds.

"Decent quality for price, but volume/bass is gone after 4 weeks of use.","I bought these products to use while running and studying. They weren't the best but for the price tag they worked really well. Great bass, about average sound quality. The charging case on a full charge lasts me more than a week too!

But...

After about a month of using it, I picked the headphones out of the case put them in and realized that I wasn't getting the same bass as I was before. I also noticed that despite it being at max volume, the music was a lot softer, barely audible while I'm at the gym or running. The same carried over to listening to podcasts, taking calls, etc.

That sucks because they were good sounding headphones, just bad quality. My guess is the bass driver broke or gave out.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds!,"High quality, I really like the charging case concept and it works great. Everything feels nice and sturdy. They fit well and are comfortable. They pair easily, have good range and the microphone is good for calls. My only complaint is that the lowest volume setting is still pretty high before it clicks to mute. I wish there were about 4 or 5 more increments between lowest volume and off—but for working outside or exercise it’s not an issue. Only in quiet settings like the office or home do I wish you could turn them down lower.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THE REAL DEAL! Best bang for your buck and then some!,"These wireless headphones are a dream come true for me. The sound quality is supreme, the comfort level is 10/10, could wear them forever without noticing them in. Again, the sound quality, especially for the price can't be beat. The charger case is legit!, the products are sturdy, non fragile, strong, with great quality, nicely built equipment and materials. I would believe that these were in the 100s of dollars range: that's how pleasantly surprised and super excited when I tried them out for the first time! They are waterproof, mic'd, great for sports/running/sweating, bluetooth and wireless, their own heavy duty charging case with magnetic receptacles for each single ear piece, both R & L. The packaging was stellar and easy as pie to pair with phone/computer/ anything bluetooth, and again, they don't lose signal or connection and there is a instructive woman's voice to guide you heard through the earpieces as to whether you've connected or not, it's a joyful experience overall! It far exceeded my expectations which were set pretty high!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great wireless earbuds for the price.,"Item as described, sound is very good for what I listen to...audiobooks, podcasts, and some music. Battery life has been fine.

"Decent budget buds, with some downsides","GOOD Cheap.  Very comfortable and stable in the ear, unlike Apple's buds (for my ears).  Long enough battery life.  Synced first try.  Have survived about 20 sweaty spin classes.
BAD The charge case is too big for a man to carry in pants pockets or a suit jacket - it's about 3x the air-pod charger case.  (For women it's not an issue.)  There is no volume or track skip control, only pause and power on/off.  You have to take out your phone to change the volume or skip forward or backward.  Weak signal: I can't carry my phone in my back pocket because if I do they start dropping in and out.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Returning due to poor battery life,"Ive been delaying purchasing buds forever as I was worried about them falling out and not being able to use for calls. Finally gave in and bought these. Today was 1 of use. The good: they dont fall out and sound quality is great. The bad: battery life is terrible, between 2-3 hrs and call quality is pretty bad too. They would be great for gym or commute only, then need to charge. Looks like I will be returning.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Set of Earbuds,"After upgrading my phone, I needed a new set of earbuds. While I could have bought a 35mm To Lightning Adapter to allow my current earbuds to connect to my new iPhone, I opted to go wireless instead. After some research, I decided to try out the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds. They were marked with ""Amazon Choice"" and had great ratings.

And the ratings are well deserved. These earbuds have great sound and clarity. I use them primarily while mowing my lawn so noise cancellation is incredibly important. The TOZO T10 earbuds definitely do the job. Pairing the earbuds with one another and with my phone is incredibly easy. And, so far, battery life seems to be fairly long; a few hours out mowing the lawn and they were still going strong.

So far, with my experience with them, I'd definitely recommend the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy to Use and Great Noise Cancelling,"I absolutely love them! I'm glad that they aren't too discrete because I wear headphones so that people won't bother me in public. I've always needed headphones that won't fall out while doing pushups, situps, or jogging! These are perfect for the job. The night I got them I used them to cancel out the noise from a scary movie my room mate was watching while I was cooking(I hate scary movies). I couldn't hear a thing!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Bass,"They have literally no Bass.  I have cranked the Bass on my phone and it is still inadequate.

On the plus side, they pair up easily, and the case acts as a charge battery, so the battery life is good, and if you don't need bass, then the sound is okay.

better than airpods,"these headphones are incredible. my friend who always flexes her airpods used to keep telling me about how much better wireless headphones are than regular headphones, and i used to never believe her. until now. until these headphones. you never realize how much of wires hinder you and how much of life you're missing out on due to them until you get these. and another bonus: they're way cheaper than airpods and have good squishy things on the ears so they don't fall out. legitimately the most life-changing purchase of my life.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Terrible!  Don’t buy them!,Absolutely awful.  I read the poor reviews and I thought they were just being too critical but they weren’t.

"Great Earbud sound, great value!","I bought the Tozo T10 as a replacement for a pair of ear buds that lasted six months. I unpackaged the Tozo T10’s, fully charged them and started the pairing process. Let me tell you, I was amazed at how easy it was to pair these ear buds to my phone. Once paired, I selected my favorite music station and enjoyed a full 2.5 hours of music before having to pack up and attend a meeting at the office. When I put them away to recharge, I had no indication that power was low, so I believe I could  have gotten at least another 2 or more hours on the charge.

They're comfortable and good battery lfie with the case but sound on Android phones is very dissapointing; at mid range to high volume there's a crackling sound as if the treble is too high ( I have Samsung s8) which It us not as noticeable when I use them on iPhones.

Too bad.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fast Easy Pairing,This is a great product.  It was extremely simple to begin using these Wireless Earbuds.  It paired immediately with my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 phone.  I am very pleased and happy with the earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great value, strong sound quality, waterproof and consistent connectivity to both earbuds!","I use these daily for a 2 hour workout and I was pleasantly surprised of the sound quality, fit, signal consistency and ease of pairing. You have to get the proper sized rubber boots but once I did (they came with the purchase) they have not fallen out. I did have to deal with their customer service but they were quick to remedy my situation within 24 hours and to my full satisfaction. Since I live in Washington I have to deal with rain so being waterproof is critical and so far so good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, wireless charging is not working.","Sound quality is excellent, nice deep base. What I do not like is the wireless charger isn't working and I have to charge it using the wired charger. I am so I pressed by the sound quality I had to give it 4 stars although the wireless charger isn't working.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very stylish and convenience,"I would have to say that the design of the earbuds and the case they come in is really nice.  The sound quality is what I expected from Bluetooth earbuds which is decent so no complaints with that feature The battery life is decent, they tend to run out of battery life quickly but that's what that cool charge station is for.  Overall I highly recommend the product to anyone who's looking for a decent wireless option to listen to music or conversation.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great bass, great battery, muddy high end.","Bought these for use while mowing five acres. Batteries last through mowing, trimming, and clean up with charge to spare. The nose cancellation is very good even without audio playing. The bass is deep and sounds great. My only complaint is the muddied high end. Still, great for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A life saver for long office days.,"The fast charge, wireless charging case, and sound quality mean I stay sane during tiring office hours. the only thing I'd change is give them more battery life., but a quick smoke break is normally enough to bring them up to around 80%.

That and the ability to change the function of the buttons, double press for re-dial on a pair of headphones seems useless. But almost all headphones do that (to my and many other's annoyance).",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Highly recommend,"I love these. I cannot wear the pre-molded earbud like air pods and have often had a hard time keeping even this type of headphone in my ear. At first, I wasn’t sure these were going to work either but once I switched to the smaller ear piece they fit perfectly. They’re easy to carry in my purse and so far I’m happy with the charge. The sound quality is great and I like that I can use only one earphone if needed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Received a defective pair, but TOZO stands by their word!!!","When i received the product, i was very happy with what I got. I enjoy ALOT of bass in my music and these earbuds were able to give me that with decent battery life. Unfortunately, the right earbud started to produce less sound than the left ear bud. After a few days,  it became unbearable. I looked to see if it was a common issue, but it wasn't. I was pretty upset, because even though I had a warranty, I know from past experience how time consuming it is to claim warranty's from manufacturers. TOZO however made it really simple. I let them know via email what happened, and they got back to me within 24 hours! They replaced my earbuds with a new set AND let me keep the defective ones. Thank God because trying to send it back probably would have been a real hassle. I have grown very fond of these earbuds and TOZO. I will probably be buying more of their products from now on.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Awesome earbuds , get them 👍🏻👍🏻","These are great earbuds, I'm glad they provide a great quality of sound and comfort in my ear, the battery is great and last a long time and the charge time is very quickly, they do not fall out , I tried moving my head around like doing an activity and didn't budge , the different sizes of ear paddings is a bonus for those with different sizes . Enjoy these buds and save some bucks and enjoy a good product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Most of the time they work well,"The build quality is great
The battery life is pretty good
Theyre okay to figure out how to set up

My only issue with them is the connectivity between both of them. If you want to use only one side, Theyll give you some trouble. When you go to use only one, They will beep every like 10 seconds unless you connect the second half. I guess its trying to say you lost or dont have connection to the other side? Maybe I got a bad unit? I dont use them as much as I could because of this issue since they are kindof finnicky to connect and use because if you just pull one out and turn it on then youll get the nonstop beeping. So I end up doing this weird combination of turning the both off and on. You could turn both on and only put one in but I end up getting serious lag if I leave the 2nd in my pocket or bag and ill constantly hear the audio stopping and starting trying to sync correctly.

Other then that issue (which might not even be noticed by a lot of people) these are excellent headphones. I really like everything about them",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
great product!!! worth more than you pay for in my opinion,"very good sound quality for the price. I had several wireless headphones before and have the T8 as well, I can say that this a big step up from T8 and a lot better from the other brands I used. I love that it’s waterproof and it can charge wirelessly. the sound is very clear and the bass is just perfect. the fit is great too and very comfortable perfect for working out. plus... great customer service... will buy again",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great in ear headphones!,These earbuds are actually pretty impressive for the price point. My only complaint is that the rubber earbuds that they provide with the headphones do not stay in at all for me. I shelled out another $15 for some malleable earbuds and it was a real game changer for the items sound quality and ability to stay in my ears.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unreliable,"Avoid these... after a couple times in the water, the left pod has completely stopped working and the right one will not connect via Bluetooth anymore.  Even when they were ""working"" it was a constant battle of what order to power them on, restart bluetooth on my phone and have to manually trigger the connect.  Distance is about 10 ft for reliable connection

Also you can't hear them when you are actually under the water.... Not a big deal for what I wanted them for but swimmers should be aware.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great quality,great price","These headphones are definitely worth getting.I was hesitant at first but so happy that I got them. Once you find the right ear pieces that fit for you they stay in place very well even while working.The sound quality is well above and beyond what I expected, and to top it all off the charger case is amazing at protecting the earbuds and acting as a portable charger. I would recommend this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good earbuds, but missing track skip / controls","I got these as they were advertised for working out and I needed some for biking. There are a lot of things to like about these for the price - they sound fantastic, they have a few sizing options and they stay in my ear when I sweat. The biggest issue I have with them is that the only controls are pause, play, and accidentally call your mom. I don't think many buying these are wanting to use them for phone calls, and if so they could pull out their phone; Tozo should've given us a skip button instead. I use a long playlist on shuffle when I'm biking and I keep my cell in my backpack, so it is a huge hassle to stop and pull it out just to skip a song I'm not feeling. For that reason these get three stars from me and I'll likely replace them soon.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They're GREAT! Even better than the previous model.,"I don't write reviews of every product that I order.  But these earbuds are truly great. I previously purchased the earlier model, TOZO T8 earbuds. They had really good sound, but the bluetooth connection was ""iffy"".  These new earbuds DO NOT have that problem at all. Now, I don't wear them swimming or in the shower (how long are your showers?), so I can't vouch for the waterproof quality. But I bought the new model earbuds because of the sound quality, comfort and convenience of the T8 model.  I can tell you that these earbuds, in my opinion, are even better for true sound and great range. They're comfortable and conveient to carry along in your pocket, purse, etc.  The battery in the recharge/storage case lasts FOREVER-- or at least it seems to.  And the recharge/storage case has nice blue LEDs to indicate how much charge is left in the case's battery-- this is really a very nice convenience.  Based on my pair of the TOZO T10 earbuds, I think you will really enjoy them, too.  So stop hesitating.  ORDER THEM!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A Really Good Budget Set of Earbuds,"I got these mainly for working out and running. The waterproofing means that they won't get messed up when I work up a sweat, and I absolutely hate running with wires dangling and bouncing around. The sound is actually surprisingly good for the price, with some nice lows and punchy mids and highs. Another thing that I really like it that they actually stay in my ears. For some reason, I was blessed with smaller than average ears, and using the smaller earbud covers makes them fit nice and snug and stay in place while I run.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and noise cancelling,"I didnt want to buy the new ihpone airpods because i always have trouble fitting them into my ears. The Lozo earbuds fit snuggly in my ear, even when i am exercising. the sound quality is amazing, i also like to have mymusic play loud and my gf says she cannot hear it anymore through these headphones! great noise cancellation. Battery life is also very good, I usually charge it once and it lasts for more than a day!!! Cant beat this price either!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Amazing for the price, sound quality with a surprising bass punch","Tozo done good on these- popped them in the case, and they paired as promised as soon as I plucked them out! Pairing to my iPhone was equally pleasing. The sound pretty much outdid my old AirPods.

Where have you been all my life?,"I LOVE these headphones. They pair easily and quickly with my iPhone. Pop em' out, turn em on and they seamlessly pair; no fiddling around. I keep the case on my keychain so it is always with me, usually charge once a week. They have been a game-changer for working out and walking into work from the parking lot (it's a long walk).

Died after two months,"These were great for the price, until I realized that I got what u paid for. I lived using them but they died on me after two months of use. I never got them wet or used them in a way in which they would break. The quality of sound is good and they work well, as long as they don’t die on you.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left channel drops out constantly,"These headphones would sound great, it they actually worked.  I used them three times on three different workouts.  The first one the left channel dropped out for very short periods of time on occasion.  The second one the left channel was off more than it was on.  The third started out great for the first 20 minutes, but then the dropouts started and got worse and worse as time went on.  They are unusable.  I can't see how anyone could stand the almost constant dropouts of the left channel.  After the third use, I packaged them back up and sent them back.

I will say that shortly after buying them I got a great email from the manufacturer offering me a free wireless charger for them, and encouraging me to write them a 5-star review because of this great offer.  What I would like more than a free wireless charger is just a product that actually worked.  Great reviews should be the result of great products, not free stuff offered after the fact.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great quality, easy to use","These came quickly, charge quickly and are easy to pair.  I am a hearing aid user and my mini-tek Bluetooth crashed so wanted an option until I am able to replace HA Bluetooth.  These fit well for me using the smallest probe tips and are comfortable.  They hold charge for at least 4 hours of continuous use.  Notice that if wearing while eating, they sometimes shift as if to come out but that's to be expected.  In the few times they have gotten wet, they wipe off easily and no problems noted when re-inserted.  Great go to product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Deal / High Quality,"This is what I was looking for, and I glad a bought them. The sound quality is great; deep base, plenty of volume, and sounds good at low volume, to.

Great headphones for the price.,"I purchased these for my sons but quickly found I needed a pair myself. for $50 I don't think you'll find a better pair of waterproof bluetooth headphones with a self-charging case!  It's a brilliant design and easy to set up and use.

Pros: Love the size, waterproof design, and the self-charging case. The multiple ear cup sizes make sure it's a fit for any ear.  Super easy to use and the sound quality is acceptable for the price.  It's also great that you can accept calls and talk without needing to take the phone out of your pocket.

Cons: I have had a call where the other person could not hear me, but then on the next call they worked fine.  Also, I did hear from one caller that my voice was a bit muffled.

Neutral: I cannot speak to the battery life as I've not fully used them for a long period of time, but having the charging case is a nice feature.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Horrible battery life,"I bought this a few months ago and everything works well. Everything but the battery life. Despite being charged in it's case. I have to constantly recharge them. I only use them for about 45 minutes!!!

"Good noise cancellation, heavy base.","This is my first noise cancellation product and also my first wireless earbud, and I must say I am very happy with it. The base quality is also amazing, I couldn't believe these little things would be able to provide such a rich and heavy base. It does sounds abit artificial and non-organic, for a lack of a better word. But I cannot complain at all. The overall sound quality is a good experience. As for usability, the interactive buttons and self paring (R and L) are VERY EASY to maneuver. Literally, just need to read 3 short sentences of instruction for use to understand what's going on.

Satisfecho totalmente se recomienda,"Muy buen producto!!  Suena muy bien, facil de usar.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality and good sound,I used it a handful of times and so far so good. Build quality seems excellent as is the case/charger. Only downside is headphones don't have much audio control except play/pause with button press. Also can't seem to be able to power off unless you place the headphones back into the case. But the auto pair once you take it out of the case is nice feature. This does have a lot of bass for it's size and good form factor. Being waterproof was definitely a reason I chose this. So far so good.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound,These earbuds are amazing.  Went to the gym yesterday and it felt like I was there by myself.  All I could hear was the music I was playing. They fit perfectly in my ear. Didn't fall out while I was running.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product at a great price.,"The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that I have not had a chance to test them thoroughly, but I will say, everything about the product is well done. All the components are made of solid material, and the quality and design are well done, but I must say I have trouble keeping the left ear bud in place, but that is more of the way my ear canal is shaped than the product. I compared them to other buds of the same price and there is no comparison. All in all I would recommend them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bought 2 of these for me and my daughter,"These earbuds were shipped on time, in great condition.  So far they fit great, and sound amazing.  The instructions tell you to twist them when putting them in and that really works.  Wireless charging or usb charging for the base, and they are nice and clearly marked Left and Right, so you don't have to strain your eyes to see which ear they go in, or which spot in the base they go in.  Would highly recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Racially triggering product descriptions,"Admittedly, for the first 3 minutes of owning this product, I was pleased. I do not like the look (or price) of airpods, so I was on the hunt for more affordable and aesthetically pleasing wireless headphones/earbuds. The reviews for this product were very good, so I went ahead and purchased them. To make a long story less long, I was trying to read more about how the two earbuds communicated to one another, so of course I picked up the instruction manual. It detailed how I should connect the left earbud, ""the slave"", to the right earbud, ""the master"". I have no idea how this sort of racially-triggering product description was put out there for public consumption. Referring to pieces of plastic as slave and master is also just unnecessary - they could have simply been called right and left earbuds. I had no choice but to return these despite the 3 minutes of excitement I felt upon first trying them out.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds!,"Gave these a try because I couldn't stomach the cost of the Apple AirPods.  Just got them, haven't really used them yet, but the price was right, fit and finish looks good, and I like the multiple tips so you can find one that fits your ears.  So far, so good.  Will be putting them to the test in about 2 hours.  Looking forward to it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than a few others I've tried,"For wireless earbuds, their sound quality is much better than a few other ones. While the bass quality doesn't match taotronics noise-cancelling earbuds that I have, they are better than other wireless earbuds.

The design isn't necessarily bad, but it can improve. I don't like how they put the ""L"" and ""R"" so big at the center of the earbud where it can be seen. Instead, a logo should have been placed there.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really enjoy true wireless ear buds,"These things are great all around. I like using my when I go to the gym, or doing work around the yard. My old Bluetooth earbuds were better than having a line running from the phone and getting tangled in something, but having no wires at all is wonderful. Sound quality is great, I'm not an audiophile, but they sound better than my previous Bluetooth set. They look way better than those stupid air pods also.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WOW - Very Nice!,"I have to admit I was a little anxious of what level of quality sound I was in for - since I had bought these at such an awesome price. The sound was rich and full so of course they passed the first step.  Since this is my first attempt at using wireless buds I was then concerned they would easily fall out - not so, they fit great.  If they didn't, there were additional sizes already included. They passed the next test.  Ease of pairing - you guessed it PASSED.  I was extremely pleased with every aspect of the product!  ( I can't speak on the waterproof part of the claim.)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Issues Works as Expected,Charge lasts and the sound quality is good. I would not wear these for noise cancellation. I’ve had no issues with this product but be sure to read what the features are and what you want in earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Quality at Great Price,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.
More than value for money",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't plan on using these for making calls! TERRIBLE microphone!,"Disclaimer - I was contacted by TOZO and they sent me a free wireless charging pad for my 5 star review of this product.  They do that apparently because the earbuds are awful for making calls.  If you want to use them for listening to music, even in wet applications, sure, go for it.  The poor reviews saying they don't work underwater are silly - Bluetooth can't transmit through a body of water - but the 1 star reviews actually telling you that they don't work when people are trying to hear you talking in completely dry, quiet conditions, those are spot on.

I contacted the company back about this serious issue through their two email accounts they were communicating with me through and heard no reply.  Samsung Galaxy Buds may only have a 2 water resistance rating while these claim to have an 8, but if you can't use them for talking on the phone, they get a 1 star from me AND are being sent back!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Guess How Many Times You Will Have to Charge These!,They have so many reviews because they offer a 10$ gift card to review them.. I've purchased many earbuds off of amazon and these are very below average mainly because the battery life is 3-4 hours... get some sensos earbuds for 20$ they sound better and last 2-3 times as long,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth it,The only thing I don't like is that when I use them to talk on the phone everyone says it's hard to hear me. So i just use my other set for talking. Other than that the battery life is great and it's pretty great at blocking out other noises.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
That they quality and fit my needs for fitness!,"I have been searching for ear buds that sound great and will stay in my ears when I work out and when I am in my road bike.

Excellent purchase!,"I've been using these for a month now, and they are perfect! They were exactly what i was looking for, now i can listen to podcasts at work without disturbing anyone else! They work either one at a time, or both at the same time if you prefer.

These earbuds have fantastic battery life, i listen to them 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and i only have to charge the unit twice. It has a convenient micro-usb charge port on the back, and battery indicator lights to show when its getting low.

The lid is even translucent, so you can watch it charge even with the lid down.

Great price for a top notch product!,"I have to say I was pretty impressed with the Tozo T10's. Packaging and build quality is high-end. Wireless charging is a bonus. IPX8 waterproofing is the icing on the cake! I am an avid mountain biker and these perform in the rain without issue so far.

Pairing was simple. Just make sure you take them both out of the case at the same time and choose TOZO-T10-R. These sound just as good as high-end earbuds but at 1/4 of the cost! I have some wireless Beats and I can't tell the difference. I wanted something I could ride with and not worry about a $200 investment! I typically ride for 60-90 minutes and I can easily get 2 rides out of them before recharging. The charging case is top notch as well. It's quite sturdy and can be charged wirelessly. Can't say enough about these little earbuds. If you're in the market for some earbuds, look no further. You won't regret this buy!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great fit and sound! UPDATED,"My big issue with ear buds is generally they either do not fit correctly or they sound terrible. Love these ear buds as they both sound and fit perfect, I will be purchasing a second pair for my wife.
UPDATE****
After using these for awhile, the sound is still great, but the left ear bud cuts out very often. It also has issues pairing with devices. Half the time I have to manually pair the head phones which is very frustrating. The sound quality when they are connected is great though.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely worth the money and more!,"I am beyond impressed with these headphones. I’ve used Bose Soundsport wireless headphones for the past 3 years because I loved the quality of sound and the battery life. However, both pairs I had started to mess up and wouldn’t charge, plus connectivity sucked. So i decided to take a chance and try these after looking at reviews and the great price.
The bass and overall sound of the earbuds is amazing, and in my opinion pretty darn close to that of Bose. The noise canceling is perfect; I can’t hear much at all around me when they’re in. They are also pretty comfortable. The medium size rubber covers they came in work just right.
Pairing is super quick and I was able to test the connectivity. I was able to leave my phone in my bedroom which is in one corner of the house and walked into the kitchen about 2 rooms away and the connection still worked.

These are a great buy especially if you’re a college student on a budget and don’t wanna blow a ton of money on AirPods or something else.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The best or better for the price,"About six months ago I lost a pair of Power Beats.  Which are very expensive in my income bracket as a school teacher.  I used them at the gym to help me escape the terrible music they blast over the PA.  I listen to podcast and music that is more meditative.  So I searched Google, Youtube reviews and personal recommendations for a new set of headphones.  Number one on my list was not to spend as much money.
I bought the gambit of cheap headphones.  All the way down to five dollars.  Then for my 65th birthday.  I decided to get myself a decent pair of headphones for my birthday.  But without spending a fortune.
 I decided to check on Amazon and discovered TOZO T10.  They got great reviews and I got them in two days.
They are amazing.  I love going to the gym again.  They are extremely comfortable.  The sound is every bit as good as my power beats.  Though I do wish they had a surround sound mode for listening to movies on my iphone.  But that might be a little bit too much for the price.  Do I recommend these?  Whole heartedly yes.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What great wireless headphones!,"I've never used wireless earbuds before so I was a bit skeptical, but the first time I paired them to my phone the sound was phenomenal!  On my wired ear buds I had to turn the volume almost to it's max setting to blur our the noise of the lawnmower, with these i had to turn them down because the sound filled my ears and the noise cancelling made the mower a non issue.  I love these so far!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lasted 3 months,"UPDATE: They were great while they lasted. Out of nowhere the left earpiece stopped working. It powers on and off but does not connect or play music. I can still hear the female voice in the earpiece when I press the buttons but it is more high pitched than it used to be suggesting some electrical malfunction.
Also, after 3 months of use I can tell you that it's not good enough for calls. People on the other end complain that my voice sounds distant as if I was talking 5 feet away from the device.
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

SOUND QUALITY: Treble and Mids are really good. I am indeed hearing musical notes I could not hear with my standard Apple earphones. However,  the bass is lacking. I am no bass freak, but these would be perfect if it had just a bit more bass. You can only compensate for the lack of base by having the ear buds very tight and deep inside your ear canal to ""trap"" the sound. This is very disappointing.

FIT: They hold up fine in the ear with little chance of falling even when running. UNLESS your ear canals get wet. Either from sweat of from showering/swimming then they fall right out. I run 30 min every day and by minute 10, I am sweating and have to constantly push the earbuds back into position or they get very loose and the sound quality is affected.

WATERPROOF: They are waterproof and I have used them in the shower 3 times so far. BUT this is pretty much a useless feature because as soon as your ear canals get moist, the earbuds fall out. If you're thinking about using the when swimming, you can forget about it. They will fall right out as soon as you get your ears wet. I am speaking from experience. And even if they held up in your ear, the range is only 10 meters. So in a standard 25 meter pool, you will constantly be losing reception.

BATTERY: I love that the case can charge the earbuds up to 4 times without plugging anything into an outlet. I rarely use them for more than an hour straight so battery life is never an issue for me.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good to Go,Really impressed with these solid affordable option for wiresless bluetooth earbuds.  Really nice sound quality for the price point and solid retention in the ear. I Have not had any issues with them pairing or connecting and they stay in great while performing all sorts of tasks whether its at home doing chores or at the gym working out. Nice to have the magnetic retention in the case when your done along with the charging feature. Helps me get through a whole week of workouts without having to worry about charging. Watch for sales and these will be a huge score. I have purchased two sets already to have a spare and would definitely purchase another set if needed in the future. Only addition I wish it had was a way to adjust volume or skip tracks but given the size I understand it is not really possible,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Appears to be waterproof to set standards,These earbuds are great. The quality of the sound is good. They charged quickly. I even dropped one in the hot tub accidentally. I picked it up and dried it off and put it back in my ear and kept listening.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product,"I just got these recently and I am not disappointed at all. I'm sure there are some better and more expensive wireless earbuds out there, but for the price these definitely are some of the best. Great sound, good bass, and a comfortable ear fit. I am very satisfied with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Pretty Good, but battery doesn't warn almost out","I wanted to wait before I gave a review. So I've used the buds for about 3 weeks so far.  Pros:  small and fit in ear pretty nicely (I don't jog with them, but I do walk), sturdy (I dropped them before, and no problems), charges quickly, no wires, love carrying case to pop them in to charge. Cons:  No warning they are about to die, battery life is about 3 hours (so if you listen to Audibles/Travel and talk - you'll need 2 pair), wiggles out of ear a little - not a perfect fit (but what is perfect?).
Overall, I'm going to stick with them.  They just take some getting used too because I used my prior wireless headset all day before needing a charge.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Kick ass head phones 🔥🔥🔥🔥,Ok so I am big fan of skull candy head cause they r loud an just last for a while I put my head phones threw a lot was gonna buy a pair again instead I gave the tozo a try never had a pair but I like the idea of no wires so they arrive today an I tell u they sounds just as good an just as loud as my skull candys an can’t wait to see how they do wen at the skate park but for the last 20 mins listening to them they r most deff worth the money an will buy them again twice thank u 🤘🏻Hope they last a little while I like high volume all day so we will see,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrible product.,"Terrible product and terrible customer service. They only last 3 hours on a good day and the left earbuds keeps breaking up and disconnecting. When I told the seller about it he did not offer to replace them he just offered to refund me 30%. He kept telling me that the they have a hard time communicating through the head. Well, isn't that what they are supposed to do? I went with the JBuds for the same price and they are awesome. 14+ hours of continuous play time and INCREDIBLE sound.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Top notch sound quality and noise reduction for its price!,"I recently had my (very expensive) pair of Powerbeat earbuds break recently, and not being a big fan of the Apple buds I went looking for a cheaper alternative. I was a bit skeptical of this product despite the number of postive reviews because of its price, but decided to give it a shot anyways. And now that I have it my, well, ears for about a week now I can safely say that it is completely worth the money!

I was actually blown away at the sound quality of these earbuds, and putting them in pretty much blocks out any other sounds for me. Along with that, a constant problem I had with my Powerbeats is that they would constantly keep falling out of my ears despite having those odd (and apparently pretty fragile after said breakage) ear hooks. But these buds stay in my ears no matter if I'm jogging, going up stairs, doing jumping jacks, or whatever odd movements.

Overall, I really can't recommend the product enough, and if you're looking for an alternative to the more recognizable brands than this one is a fantastic choice.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good for jogging or gym. Left ear cuts out,"Update a month out. Right ear quit charging. Contacted tozo and they sent me a new pair and they work great. Left ear does not drop at all. Sent me a wireless charger for inconvenience also. Customer service did a good job.

The sound quality is excellent. They fit well in my ears. Very easy to use and connect. Charging case is convenient. Problem I have with them is the left ear cuts out a couple times a minute while jogging or working out. If sitting at my desk or driving they work great but I purchased them to use while working out so 3oo5 rating from me",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent fit and sound!,"There is nothing to dislike about these earbuds.  They sound great and fit perfectly.  Four tip sizes to choose from for perfect fit.

Excellent choice.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds for a great price.,"I bought these as a birthday present for my wife. She loved them. She likes the small size and light weight. The sound quality is great for a $50 set of earbuds. The wireless charging ability is great since the charging port cover is not the easiest to open. They say that they are waterproof, but we haven't tested that yet. All in all, I think $50 was a great price for what we got.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tons of background noise,"These are great for listening to music  Sound quality is good while listening to music,  but if you are on the phone the person you’re talking to hears nothing but background noise making it difficult Fire the other person to hear you.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FINALLY !!!  Ear buds that WORK as promised,"1st off let me say these are my 5th or 6th try at getting great sound out of ear buds.  I was thinking that it just wasn't doable.  Ordered these earlier today and they showed up early evening, wow and wow.  Went with white as I am tired of losing things in airplanes and gyms.  Nice change.

So, sound quality:  WOW.  I listen to a lot of Latin: Prince Royce, Romeo Santos, Aventura.... things with lots and lots of harmonies and mid range percussion, bongos and crazy things.  To FINALLY get buds that bring out that myriad of sound is an answer to a prayer.  Clear, crisp highs, clean drums and mid ranges, clear voice.  The base is just right, very present but not overwhelming.  Listening to Daddy Yankee Dura, holy crapioly,  amazing percussion....  I feel like breaking into Zumba!!!

 I would say just about perfect sound.  The best I have heard this side of my $1,500.00  Alpine Audio in my Nissan Z.

I like that they are waterproof, not that I am going to go swimming with them in to test it, but still kind of cool.  More than able to handle sweaty LA Fitness trips.  Gotta love the wireless charging feature too.

All this for $49.00 is CRAZY.  So glad I kept trying and returning until I found these gems.  I will be looking no further.

My only suggestion would be to include Comply foam ear tips.  That would be a huge  win.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can't use buds independently 👎🏻,"The sound on these headphones are great not going to lie. But you CANNOT use just one at a time.

"Music sounds great, phone calls not so much.","These earbuds get a 3-4 rating. Sound quality when I listen to music is excellent, but when I talk on the phone with them the other party can barely hear me. The battery life is great.. they got delivered to my house in a timely fashion and the price was right..
They are also pretty heavy and I have a hard time keeping them in my ears. I could definitely not run in them, but they’re ok for listening to sounds at work. I may end up trying to order some ear hooks to keep them in place.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good earphones for the price,"The sounds quality is very good in my opinion. The battery life could be better, of both the earbuds and the charging case. And I don't like that it continuously tells you that the battery life is low for the last several minutes of the battery life. It interrupts your listening. They aren't true noise cancelling, but if you choose the right earbud size, they do keep out a decent amount of ambient sound. They are definitely waterproof. I have worn them in the shower and dropped them in water without issue.
I did have a problem with my right earbud (the main one) and am needing to have it replaced. It stopped pairing to my phone. Working with the company to have it replaced has been easy, however.
Overall, I think they are a good earphone for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THE BEST,"I love the sound and not having to untangle my wires since these are wireless. I had a call come in while working out on bike and I could talk and hear their voice great and went back to music as soon as call was finished....awesome.....love, love these for running and working out. Read another review and realized I have extra buds to adjust to my ears and this is even a better fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value,"This product looks very sleek and high quality.  The ease of syncing to Bluetooth is as simple as it gets.  They cancel outside noise very well and the sound quality is great.

The reason I didn't give full 5 stars is that I have noticed that while the sound is great quality, people I call often say they cannot hear me very well so I end up taking them off and just using my phone directly.  I'm not sure if there's a setting I can adjust to have a stronger microphone, but that's been the biggest issue.  For listening to music, however, the headphones are great.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing quality for the price,My husband bought these earbuds for him and I soon as I tried them on they became mine. The sound quality is excellent.They fit in my ears perfectly as you have different sizes of plastic ear caps to try in your box. When you are done with them you put them back in their little box to be charged. You don’t have to pair them they automatically find your device as long as your bluetooth is on. They are waterproof too but you can loose your signal if you go underwater. Great wireless Earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Generally good, but with some minor annoyances.","I've had these a few months now and wanted to share my experience. It's easy to review right away (something they kept pestering me to do with initial impressions that don't line up with longer term usage. I've generally been happy with them, but there are a few things that have annoyed me about them.

I bought these to replace the cheap wired earbuds I've used for years to mainly use to listen to audiobooks while riding my bike, doing chores and running errands. I haven't really listened to a lot of music with them so I can't speak too well to how they sound as the requirements for audiobooks are pretty different. But they've been pretty good for my audiobooks.

There are two things that I really love about these. The first is the ability to start/stop my audio book by pressing the earbud without having to fumble for my phone, which is especially valuable while riding. The other is the general convenience of wireless. With my old wired earbuds I constantly caught the wires on my handlebars of my bike and a variety of other things when doing chores that'd pull them out of my ears.

The first few times I rode my bike I was in constant fear of them falling out of my ears. That was my fault for not trying out every size. I went with something that seemed to fit fine at home but as I rode they felt like they'd pop out so I was constantly re-adjusting. Once I got the right size that feeling has mostly subsided. It's really worth your time to play around with all the sizes even if one of them feels good when you try them. There may be another size that fits better.

My main issues now are dropped connections and charging.

I was reluctant to switch to wireless because I didn't want to deal with having keep them charged, but that has mostly been a non-issue. I did have a day where I thought it was charging only to realize the right earbud was out of power halfway through my ride. Since the connection to the phone goes through the right one, I couldn't simply use the left earbud and had to cut my ride short.

I have found it can be sometimes buggy where the right earbud wants to stay connected to the phone and won't charge even when I have it back in the charging case. I reread the manual and don't recall seeing any tips on this, but I've found it works best when you put the left earbud in first and once the red light comes on the put in the right earbud and close the lid. If you don't close the lid it seems to stay connected to the phone.

I haven't tried the recharging of the case on the go very much so I can't speak to how well that extends the battery life, but apart from when it didn't charge properly I've never run into issues with the battery life even after several hours of usage. However I've never needed a full day on the go and I'd typically have the case plugged in and would top off the buds when I didn't need them in between activities where I did.

When I ride I keep my phone in my pocket as I don't have any sort of armband. Most of the time it's fine, but often when I raise my head slightly to drink some water the audio drops off for a few seconds. I'm not sure why. I once accidentally left my phone on a different floor of my house and it kept playing for awhile without issue, so I don't think it's a distance issue. It's annoying but not a major issue.

I've also found issues with the initial pairing to my phone if I pull the left earbud out of the case too soon. So now I tend to just pull out the right and wait for it to pair with the phone, then pull out the left. The left will pair to the right almost immediately after so it just works smoother for me this way.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Neat Charging System and Excellent Sound Quality,"The little wireless earbuds have great sound quality for listening to music.  They go into the box for storage/charging and automatically pair when they are pulled out of the charging box.  The charging box has a battery of its own so the earbuds get charged even when not connected to a charging cord or wireless charger.  If using for phone calls, the mic isn't great - it picks up sound from everyone nearby.  We'll keep them to listen to music because that part is great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent ear buds,Was hesitant to order these. I was used to a pair of expensive shure ear buds so I thought these would be a total let down. These are so convenient and the sound quality is superb.

This product could use more work.,"The positive side is they were nice and loud and they stayed in my ear with little to no falling out.

There were three overall problems that need to be fixed. 1). When on the phone the other party was unable to hear  me unless I removed the right earbud and spoke int it directly. 2). When I moved my head from side to side, the left earbud would fade in and out. Lastly they would constantly disconnect and reconnect to my cellphone(s).",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound,"I purchased these ear buds just a few days ago and they came straight away. Connected them to my phone, which was incredibly easy, and proceeded to listen to talk information. I was impressed by the clarity and noise canceling of the units. I honestly have a hard time hearing anything outside of the sound coming from the speakers. This morning I decided to listen to music (heavy metal), and was once again VERY pleased with the quality of the product. The full range of dynamic sound is actually way better than I was prepared for at the price of them.
If I did have one complaint, it would be that they could go louder. Personal preference of course as I like my music to BLAST my ears when I am in the zone! :)
All in all this is a GREAT PRODUCT and I would recommend them to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Product,"It is a fantastic earbud! I was in the jacuzzi and the right Earbud fell in the water.

These things are amazing!,"This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I've owned; partly because I'd always feared that the pairing would be a pain. But my experience with the Tozo T10s has been just the opposite. By the time I pull the first earbud out of the charging case and stick it in my ear, it's already announcing that it has paired with my TV (I bought them for bedroom TV watching so as not to disturb my wife, who's usually reading).
  The sound quality is excellent; way better than listening to the TV speakers. Dialog is clear, and you get a way better sense of ""space"" through these.

"The headphones are great, great quality, loud speech/music. But... (Hate case)","The headphones are great, great quality, loud speech/music. But...

1st.) I have cheaper wireless headphones that last longer and are smaller. These headphones last between 3 - 3 1/2 hours, cheap headphones last 4 hours+, but I guess that's what you have to give up for better sound.

2nd.) I absolutely hate the Battery in the case every wireless headphone I  have had in the past have had a case that lasted 2 days or more. when I use these headphones for 4 hours in a day only one headphone at a time It doesn't completely drain the case battery after they charge, but it does go pretty low, like 1/4 blue lights. So I pretty much have to charge it every day. Also if I fully charge it and don't use it for like 3-4 days Its completely dead by the time I want to use it again, That's weird because none of my other wireless headphones does that (the cheapest brand at least keeps some charge in the case and the headphones always stay full)

All in all, These are the best sounding wireless headphones I own. It has an annoying beep when turned on but that dies out after 1 or 2 mins. I Just HATE the case.

EXTRA
P.S. when are they going to make some headphone that has good controls, they all suck in that category (Tip. 1 press for play and pause, 2 presses for skip song, 3 presses for repeat/go back a song.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Buy,"The sound quality of these earbuds are better than the skullcandy earbuds I'm used to using. The pairing process was very easy, their instructions are easy to follow but pretty much you just need to pair your phone with the right earbud and the left is automatically connected with the right. I was personally concerned about how the earbuds would feel in my ear, but I think after wearing them a couple times, you get used to it and don't even realize they are in your ear.

"Excellent earbuds, stunning sound sound quality, great battery life, easy to pair to many devices!","For a while I had resigned myself that i could't get great sound from earbuds but now I am totally impressed by the deep bass and clear highs. I had almost forgot the great sound I heard from my music collection until I got these earbuds. I could swear the bass is near sub-woofer levels and that is while jogging in the city. The noise cancellation blocks out most sound but still being able to hear sounds that you need to hear like fire engines. Just the perfect amount for me.

I am impressed by the battery life because I listen rather loudly and thought it would drain the battery too much but it has no effect on the battery life. I love the charging case!

I am constantly pairing between two laptops, an Nvidia Shield and my phone and I find myself looking forward to the voice assistance as I power up or pair to hear the message that I am connected to my device of choice. I have paired with devices that are Bluetooth 4.0, 4.1 and 5.0 with great success. I enjoy the range i have from my phone in one room while walking to another room. I used to think that only wired earbuds would sound great but I love these earbuds! The only downside is that you will love listening with these comfortable earbuds so much is that you won't get much work done.

Would be the best thing on the market if sound didn't drop out...,"This thing sounds and feels great. Definitely a better sound and fit then the Apple Air buds. However the sound cuts out on the left side when walking on the sidewalk. It does have a much more stable connection in an office environment where there is less (wifi?) interference. Unfortunately this dropout issue prevents it from being useful while walking or jogging outside (a problem the Airbuds do not share).

I contacted their support and they instructed me to reset it (turn off by holding down, hold down for 15 secs till purple light) but the problem persisted. It’s a pity because I would gladly have paid double the price if only it worked properly. I'll be looking for an alternative...

  I was really happy with the earbuds (despite the lack of volume control) until a few days ago. The left earbud will not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours while the right one can go for 5 or more. It's too bad since these are the first buds that actually stay in my ears.

I just unboxed the earbuds and had them paired with my phone, Echo Dot and Amazon Fire stick within a matter of minutes. The sound is great and they actually stay in my ears. The only issue I have is that there's no volume control on the earbuds and I can see that as being a major inconvenience (hence the 4 star rating.)",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Superb Sound Quality!,"I was a bit skeptical at first when I looked at this product, regarding its quality. But after using it for 3 weeks I can confirm that I made the right choice going with this. The sound quality is just awesome. It has a stereo bass kind of effect that surrounds you and Bluetooth 5.0 makes it even better with longer range and its superior data rate. You won't find any difference between this product and your wired earphones in terms of quality.
I was able to use these earbuds for 3 hrs straight which is pretty great. The charging case it comes with can be charged wirelessly and it can charge your earbuds twice, completely. All in all, I would recommend this product. For the price, it's definitely a win!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding sound quality!,"Just got these a few days ago and I am very impressed with them. The bass is more than I expected, even better than the LG Tone headphones. The pairing is also easier than I thought it would be, seeing that there are no really visible controls. The wireless charging for the case works very well and the case charges the buds quickly. I ran them down all the way and after only a few minutes of charging I could use them again, although not fully recharged. I would definitely recommend these earbuds. Well worth the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No cords! Awesome pairing and sound!,"I'm not an expert on noise cancellation ear buds but I can still hear all of what I need to hear while still picking up a conversation in the background. Whether or not this is normal I think it is great because personally I still like to know what is going on around me. These buds are great because I can cook and even blow dry my hair and watch or listen to something for the first time in my life. Also, you don't have to worry about wires!!!! I love the new found freedom. Everything about them, the pairing, the case for charging, and hassle free way they go in the ears is fabulous. Great company too. Good job!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality product great customer service.,"I liked the sturdy construction since day one. The product is well made and light weight. The connection and programming is flawless and works great. Even after a few drops from up on a ladder the earbuds wash off and work perfectly. And customer service is top notch! Great response times and they actually care about their customers, such a rarity nowadays.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for the price!,"I love these! They sound great! The battery lasts a good while! No wires! My only problem with them is the annoying beeping they do when you connect one ear bud to your phone but not the other. I like to be able to listen to audiobooks while I grocery shop, but want to have an ear free to listen around me.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones for running,"These headphones have been great so far, I run with them and was pleasantly surprised at how well they stay in my ears, i have a new pair of the wireless Bose over the ear headphones and to be honest the base that comes from these is better if not just as good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Other than occasional blip sound is great! Fantastic for Music! Too quiet for phone calls,"I really enjoy these headphones. They came for a great price and the experience of using them is great.

Pros:
Great Sound - Rich Bass
Less expensive than other similar headphones
Suction cup earbuds with 4 sizes
Good battery life

Cons:
Mic too quiet for phone calls (using iPhone SE)
Will not auto-pair with phone, need to select earbuds in bluetooth menu before every use. Usually causes delay when answering a phone call",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud cuts out when moving around,"Thought I'd give these a try since they are the most popular earbuds on Amazon.  I think they have good sound quality - not professional of course but for most every day use, it is good.  They fit great in my ears and I like the simplicity of wireless charging, pairing, etc.  HOWEVER, the left earbud does in fact drop signal or cut out if you're doing any activity such as walking around, exercising, or just being outside.  This was my immediate experience after trying these out.  I'll probably keep them because I'm only using them in bed at night, but for anyone else, you might want to consider this.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Probably the best ear buds under $50,"These are great. I tried 3 other Bluetooth wireless earbuds before this one and they all had spotty connection and just didn't feel as well built. These are a little bigger in my ear than I had anticipated, and they do become uncomfortable after a few hours. But at least I get a full work day of battery life, and over time I think I will get used to how they fit. Overall, I'd give these a 4.5.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price!,"These things are great! I pop them in before taking a shower, and they work wonderfully! They have a good seal, and sound amazing. I work outside and I'm not worried about these in the rain. I forget that they're in my ear and can wear them all day.. I think they've only died on me once.. And that was after about 6 hours without putting them back in the case. I think I've charged the case maybe once a week if I remember.. The case hasn't died on me once.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent quality at a decent price.,"I bought these after I broke my last pair of buds and at first I was skeptical of these as I had never heard of the brand, but they turned out to be pretty good though. I'm not an elitest audiophile, so I don't really care that these aren't the best possible sound quality and noise cancellation. I actually can get 5+ hours off one charge as opposed to the 3.5 they advertise plus the actual charger has a pretty good battery capacity. Overall pretty good. If you're on the fence about these I would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FAKE REVIEWS. DO NOT BUY CHEAP CHINESE GARBAGE,I was willing to give them a chance until this lovely email. All the reviews are fake. Can't connect to my windows 10 PC. Sounds worse than an $8 pair of ear buds. They do however block noise out completely for me so I will give them that. Battery life is about 4 hours or so. I am not going to hang onto my product and wait to see how long they last when there are plenty of other products that aren't trash.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Felt a bit like a prototype with bugs,"With so many good reviews, I expected these to be a bit easier to work with.  Sound quality is on par with what I expected for this price range. What got me was the pairing process for each time I’d connect. It wasn’t consistent in turning on when I pulled the first one out of the case and it never connected both without some awkward on/off sequencing of each earbud.  They also showed up as individual Bluetooth connections (one L and one R) which was really odd way to deal with a stereo pair.  Also the earbuds wouldn't consistently charge. They seemed to need to pushed really hard into the case to charge.  I ended up with the Anker neo libertys and those are pretty seamless",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Value and Product,"These are the best earbuds I have ever had. If you are like me, you go through several pairs  of earbuds a year and it is hard to find ones that live up to their price point.  They have great sound quality and are extremely comfortable. I would recommend them to anyone who finally wants to have one pair of earbuds they can commit to.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent earbuds! Best Value on Amazon!,I needed these to be able to make Bluetooth phone calls on my cell phone and use them on Zoom calls on my computer and laptop. I have only had them a few days but people have told me my voice is coming through clearer than when I had my phone up to my ear. The sound is great and I just bought a second pair for my wife!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
terrible audio quality and connection stability,"I got these to replace a set of bluetooth earphones (with the left and right buds connected by a wire) to use for workouts, conference calls, and listening to audiobooks / music while walking outdoors.  These earphones failed at delivering even decent quality on all 3.  The left and right earbuds frequently go out of phase, so there's a micro-delay between the L and R channels.  If that's not bad enough, if you're in a crowded gym, outside with your iPod / iPhone in your pocket, or ANY situation other than ""empty room with your paired device 3 inches away from the earbuds and no obstruction between the 2,"" there are frequent gaps in the audio. This proved true on multiple devices, with a full battery charge, and basically every other situation I can imagine.  Don't buy these, they're not worth it.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quailty with wireless charging case, well worth the money!","I love these ear buds! This is the 1st pair of Bluetooth ear buds that i have ever owned and for the price they sound really good.  My favorite feature is the wireless carging case, that is awesome!  My only problem is i dont have a wireless charger yet.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
magnetic charging case is very nice!,I love these earbuds! They turn on and pair up as soon as you take them from the case. They are very comfortable to wear and stay in my ears without falling out! They sound fantastic!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality headphones for reasonable price,"Initially, I was skeptical about buying wireless headphones because my main concern is sound quality. Apple airpods have great sound quality but do not fit my ears. With these headphones, they provide just that and more. I am also an active person so I use these while at the gym. I also recently found out that I can swim with them, but not deep underwater and they work perfectly and still work at a far distance. All in all, this is definitely worth the buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and battery life,"Great sound quality and amazing battery life! Tozo is a good company to buy from too. I had an issue with the headphones, and they kept in contact with me to figure out how to fix it. 10/10 would recommend to a friend",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
EASY TO WORK WIRELESS EARBUDS!!!,"The TOZO wireless earbuds were exactly what I was looking for. I watch many YouTube videos late at night and really needed something quick and easy to wear to listen to videos while my family slept. I thought I had selected the white colored ones upon ordering but i received the black ones and I was still happy with them. Will love a second pair for my husband who’s a runner but will have to wait for now. The different size earbuds that come with the product help out but my teenage daughter was still unable to find the right size for her when she tried to borrow them from me since she has super tiny ear canals. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for wireless earbuds.

One thing they did not have that might make them better is the ability to control volume. Unless I totally missed the instructions on how to work the volume feature, I don’t think you can do that with these wireless buds. The feature of easily managing phone calls simply by tapping on the earbuds is so cool though!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth,Does not fit in the ear properly and it falls down every 30 seconds. Sound Quality is below average. Dollar store earphones are better than this. Returning the product.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Superior quality for a great price,"Sound quality is surprisingly really good, as well as the fit. They stay in your ears well unlike apples earbuds, these are very comfortable. I love the fact that the case serves as a charger and that you can put it on a wireless charging pad. Bluetooth pairing was super easy. My fiancé has apple’s AirPods and he was jealous of these. Love that these are superior quality for a great price!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
All around awesome product,I was a little hesitant ordering these as I have heard many stories of pour sound quality.  WOW!!  I couldn't be more impressed with these.  They came pretty much fully charged right out of the box.  When I turned them on BOOM!! awesome clarity and deep bass.  I for sure recommend these.  Thanks!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great stereo Bluetooth headphones,"These are the first Bluetooth headphones I have been happy with.  I have bought several different pair and these are the first ones that work well, don't drop communication, are water proof, and don't hurt my ears after having them in for several hours.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of bluetooth headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome wireless ear buds for the money,"Wow, I love these ear buds, the wireless charging is great, the sound quality is amazing. I will usually use one at a time and the battery will last about 4 hours each. When you use them both, outside sounds are almost totally nonexistent. I just bought a second pair to keep at the house. Great for mowing the yard.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the $$,Great pair of headphones for the price. I’ve had a only one connect once or twice but it was easily rectified by a basic restart. For less than 1/3 cost of similar headphones these are phenomenal.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earbuds for this price range!!,"I absolutely love these ear buds. I use audible almost consistantly. Especially at work. The sound quality is great and they are comfortable. No falling out or slipping. I love that the case is on a lanyard so I'm not losing it. I love that they 're waterproof as I have a tendency to fall asleep in the tub with them in. My only slight complaint is the distance the ear buds can go from my phone. Usually I would have my phone on the charger at home and have the ear buds in while I am doing housework, but the range on this pair doesn't reach my whole house. Very small downside and would absolutely recommend.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great and Affordable Wireless Earbuds,"The earbuds work well and the price point was very good, the product came and it feels very solid.  I have small ear holes so it was great to see that it came with multiple sizes so you can switch it to your preferred size.

Pairing it was easy and there was a handy guide included so you don't have to look through the manual to get started.

The sound itself is nice for blue tooth, and the twisting action really keeps the buds in your ears so they don't fall out.

All in all a great product and I am left satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect,"I got these to replace my non waterproof buds I had before and I'm so happy about it. I use them at work and then move to the gym and they are amazing. The sound is perfect, I hear nothing else, lightweight and actually fit in my weirdly small ears.

Sweat a lot during a workout? No problem these bad boys didn't miss a beat even in the sauna.
Cross country flight? You're in luck the battery will last.

Bonus: They don't look like those weird apple ones....",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"So I originally thought these ear buds were the best.. turns out ... not so much. The first couple days everything was great! Then people that I was speaking to on my phone using the ear buds started telling me that they couldn't hear me or I sounded far away or in a tunnel. I've made sure the ear buds are charged and my phone has service so I don't know what is wrong with these things. Definitely disappointed at the poor design
(I should have went with the other ear buds I was going to get) and the reason for the star change/updated review. Would not recommend if this is what happens after a week of use.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very disappointed,"I bought these because of the reviews and am really disappointed. The sound is of lesser quality than the free corded iPhone headphones that come with your phone. Sound for music isn't horribly disappointing but the hands free phone function is absolutely worthless. I can still hear a lot of the noise around me but that doesn't bother me personally. I had thought I read good points about battery life but out of the gate I think the longest they have lasted is 2-3 hours at best without a charge in the little case. I have had these for a week and already have the left earphone not connecting to Bluetooth.

I would suggest looking around. Maybe I just got a bad set, I do not know. I will likely be requesting a refund.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Constantly cutting out, can't listen to music","These are awesome in every way EXCEPT one, and it's the most important one. The bluetooth connection is horrible. I loved these, I prayed to the high heavens that they would work because they fit wonderfully, they have great sound quality, the wireless charging aspect is awesome, the charging case is the best part of all of this. The biggest down side is that they CONSTANTLY cut out and lose the connection to my phone. They claim they have a 10m connection, but if my phone is in my back pocket of my jeans, I can barely listen to my music because they're cutting out every 30 seconds to a minute. It's frustrating and unfortunately outweighs all the positive things. Not sure how this got such positive reviews, since although nice quality in all other aspects, it's nearly impossible to actually listen to anything. Very, very disappointed.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Connectivity and fit issues,"So in general these aren't a bad set of ear buds as you can see by the other reviews.

However, the set that I got must be defective as they have a really poor connection during use. While using them in the gym if I moved more that 3 feet away from my phone the audio would cut out. 1 ear bud would stay connected and the other will go out, the would reconnect, then it would flip.

Another thing was they would constantly try to connect to my phone even while in the case. The only way I was able to get them to stop was to forget the connection on my phone.

Also, regardless of what little rubber ear piece I used they would fall out of my ears. Followed the instructions to the letter on how they are supposed to ""lock"" but they never did (might be that I just have weird ears, I don't know).

Overall the sound quality was good for the price but there were just too many issues for me to recommend anyone purchasing them even for that price.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely fabulous!,"I tried these on a day or two after these arrived. They work great and are amazing in every way. There is just one problem that I have noticed. When I am doing an activity that involves constantly changing direction like running around a small square or around a circle or an 8 shaped symbol, I lose audio for a brief second or two at the instant I am making a turn but then audio is back after the turn. I wish that problem wasn't there. Besides that little flaw, it works perfectly otherwise.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Defective left ear bud,"I really wanted to like these ear buds. The sound quality is decent and they're pretty comfortable, unfortunately it's all for nothing.  Bluetooth connection is incredibly poor on the left ear bud and cuts out constantly rendering them unusable. I have read other reviews with people that have had a similar issue and don't want to risk an exchange just to get another defective pair; I will be returning these for a refund.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Comfortable wearing with high performance noise cancellation.,"I purchased this to use during training in Golf Range. I am listening metronome tempo.
I used have a wireless earbuds having a wire around my neck. Which was very uncomfortable. This is the main reason that I purchased this one.

Pairing was seamless and it is actually very comfortable!
Another thing is that noise cancellation is much better than I expected! Hence, I have to take out my left earbuds to hear the feedback sounds from golf balls when hitting.

I really like this one.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
good price,"The sound quality in these are amazing! but the battery life isn't great, they're not noise cancelling and it often drops from my Bluetooth with IPhone X. Also using it for phone calls isn't good sound quality. For 50$ the price is good if youre just using it  for working out and nothing else. I lost my Jabra's and these were a good comp, but I'm going to purchase the Jabra again .",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love these!,"These are my go to head phones. For gym, home, everywhere. They have a good battery life, no cords, and good sound plus sound cancellation! Super easy and a weekly charge. They haven't died on me and I've had them for several months now. Love these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprising,"Seems a little laggy on response. When my phone makes noise (system sound) there seems to be a delay. I did also have a couple times where it seemed like they dropped the connection to my phone but picked it right back up.

Sound wise there really nice. Loud enough and a clean sound. I'd say noise canceling is a bit to good,but not quite 100% noise canceling. Meaning you can still hear a bit with the volume lower but not quite good enough to listen to a conversation. I'm a runner and I'd hoped they would block out some ambiant noise but still let me hear cars.

They block out cars. My son tried talking to me with them In and I could hear him but not understand what he was saying",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love them!,"I love how discreet they are, even more than AirPods in my opinion. The nose cancellation and the sound quality are amazing; I can hear and feel the bass of certain songs and the volume never has to be very loud for me to not hear anything but the song I'm playing. The best part is that the earphones charge in their case so even though the battery life is 3 hrs (from full charge to zero), it ends up being longer if you always put them back in the case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for a price but not ideal for a workout,"The headphones are good and have a crystal clear sound, however I notices that after sometime they start to wiggle out of my ear and not a ideal option for working out, else I would have given 5 stars",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awsome Earbuds!,These ear buds were exactly what i was looking for. Much more economical than wireless Apple brand. I wanted these wireless ones for work so i could have just one ear bud in at a time to hear things out of my other ear. These work great because they can be paired one at a time so the other can be charging and not in use while i use the other. They last about half the day of constant use then i just switch to the other one. Absolutely would recommend to anyone that can't afford the Apple brand. These are great and way better than expected.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds,So this is only based off of a day but ao far this is an excellent purchase. The earbuds sit comfortably with the smaller pads (a few different sizes are included) and the aound quality is about as good as I expected. Nothing exceptional but perfectly adequate. I use them for the gym and enjoy all the features especially thr battery charger case which can be charged wirelessly. It's very convenient. I don't know how long the battery life will last yet but my needs are being met. Pairing is easy and successful.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
poor connectivity through my body,"If I have my phone (OnePlus 3) in my right-front pants pocket it will mostly work fine communicating with the right earbud.

Otherwise, if I have my phone in my left-front pants pocket, the earbuds briefly but regularly cut out, every few minutes. If my phone is in my rear pants pockets, it is cutting out nonstop.

These earbuds sound quality is great when the connection is working. The microphone sounds fine to my callers when making phone calls.

The earbuds stay put in my ears only just OK. I have to position them carefully for them to not wiggle their way out during exercise.

The little charger/carrying case works well.

Overall, I'd say these earbuds are barely adequate.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't stay in ears,"Sound quality was good and would be fine while stationary, but even light movement caused mine to fall out or have the feeling of about to fall out, which was almost more annoying. Swapping out the silicone cover did help at first, but after a short time had same problem. These are larger than I expected, loved the wireless charging case, but ultimately invested in Air Pods and have been much happier.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Fit, Great Sound","I received these earbuds a couple days ago and have since worn them for a couple workouts at the gym and gone on a few runs wearing them.  After I selected the ear insert that fit my ears best, these buds fit snug and do not feel like they will fall out while running or at the gym.  Pairing was easy (I have a Samsung Note 8).  The sound quality is solid and the bass was fuller and deeper than I expected from such a (relatively) small earbud.  Finally, the charging box is nice - the buds have a bit of a magnetic snap into place and overall the earbuds and charging box feel like well-made products.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product - but the bright flashing LED while in use is a problem (I have a fix),"These really work well for all the reasons posted many times by others (good sound, great case, battery, pairing, comfort, etc.). One important feature is that these do NOT beep constantly, in between every song or video, like some Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, and that is really important.

But the bright blue LED that flashes periodically on each earbud while in use is a real problem if you are in a dark place, or listening at night. It lights up the whole room, and is blinding if you look right at to anyone nearby it their eyes are adjusted to the dark. What are people to do on dark airline flights? The person sitting next to you is going to murder you after 2 minutes of being blinded every 5 seconds. Your spouse is going to divorce you if you attempt to listen to stuff at night and the room keeps lighting up like the police are raiding the place.

I solved the problem by covering the LEDs with small pieces of electrical tape that I cut out, but now there is no way to see any indicators at any point in time. I hope they will consider changing the product to either allow the ""in-use"" flashing to be disabled or dimmed to a reasonable level.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good fit,These were easy to activate and have a variety of sizes for ear pieces which was important to me as I have not used earbuds before because they fall out.  These work well and I wore them when biking with confidence they would not fall out.  My needs are not great and these answer my desire for wireless integration with my phone.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Good Quality for the Price,"This is my third attempt at wireless earbuds and I cannot complain about these.  I have small ears and these fit perfectly.  I was even able to go jogging with them.

Other than that, I am really enjoying them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great little earbuds,"These are great little earbuds.  They sound great, plenty of bass.  I got better bass after switching to a larger ear piece. These come with 4 sizes, which is nice. Very compact case. I wish there was space to fit the usb cable into the charger/case but That is not enough to take away from the great quality of this product, especially for the price.

phone calls don't work well on iOS,"They don't work for phone calls.  People on the other end cannot hear because of sound fading and static.  They are ok listening to music at the gym, but usually have to re-connect multiple times.  Battery life is good",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Headphones are great for their price,"Disclaimer: I bought them on a flash sale for about 30% off but would buy it now anyway.

PROS: The headphones are working great. I sometimes shower with them in my ear with no problem, they last a full day and a half for me and the sound quality is great (I tuned it for myself in the Samsung equalizer). Case lid is pretty solid and has never opened however many times i dropped it. Headphones work up to 10 meters away unobstructed.

CONS: However, the left earbud (slave) cuts out if you keep the right ear but (main) away enough or behind  barriers (in extended clutched hand, in pants pocket etc.), but listening with right earbud is never a problem. And now starts the nit-picking: NO ONE THOUGHT OF MAKING THE DOUBLE CLICK SKIP TO NEXT SONG, INSTEAD IT REDIALS LAST CALLED NUMBER (led to some awkward explanations). And the plastic case has a little hinge for you to attach a string to not lose it i guess? I cut it off because it was awkward to hold/look at. The lid has these magnetic bits that could have been concealed a bit better but meh.

EXTRA:I read the reviews before buying but you don't need the box to pair the headphones to the phone. There is a button to (turn on/off, connect, play/pause).

Overall I am loving these headphones and learned it's quirks fairly quickly. Good product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I'm quite happy with my TOZO T10 wireless earbuds,I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.  This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far.

Constant Pairing Issues and Poor Battery,"It is always a hassle to try and pair these headphones. Sometimes it take 10 plus attempts. They seem to pair ""when they want to"". Also, i have used these on 2 hour flights and they have consistently died before the end of the flight. I received a very odd mass email from the company after i registered my product online that they would send me another charging case and i never got anything.

Great product,Is is a great product. The sound is amazing. They're comfortable. The only reason I don't give it a 5-star is because the case is big compared to others in the market. Too bulky to keep it in your pockets.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Disappointed, more like bluetooth 00.1 not 5.0","Extremely disappointed, unable to connect to a Samsung phone or iPhone.  The earbuds have connection issues. I will recommend (Abnes earbuds) for less money. I was looking foward to a better bass as advertised.

Wasted 45 minutes trying to troubleshoot them, should've listened to the other reviews.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Customer Service= Now I’m a Customer!,"I just received excellent service from phobe, a very kind representative of Tozo!  After I sent an email to Tozo’s customer service, phobe responded in the most kind and caring way!  What happened was that I accidentally left my earbuds in one of my pant’s pockets, and Tozo responded back with giving me a complimentary set of earbuds so I can be happy again with my Tozo earbuds!  This amazing experience I’ve had with Tozo means I’m a guaranteed customer for a very long time!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sleek design and good sound, don’t slip out of the ear nor look tacky","The sound quality is pretty good, clear and not tinny with decent bass. The khaki case is kind of a teddy bear brown. It may look misleadingly gold but it is matte tan. The earbuds fit well with your right tip so try every tip for the best fit and sound. I love that the case snaps magnetically, super sleek design I just wish it wasn’t completely plastic as it may come apart over the years. Apply for a 1 year warranty! Last thing, connectivity was really straight forward and I love that they were charged as they came, no one likes waiting to use a product ;) These are good for the price!

Left ear pod is useless,"I wanted to love these...  I’ve had them for a few months in hopes to give them a better shot, but  the left ear pod cuts out almost every two seconds if I’m walking or moving. It’s pretty much like having one headphone the entire time with sound in your left ear for one second at a time every 10 seconds.  I looked online after I bought these and it seemed to be a common issue. Sadly looking for a different pair of headphones because it drives me insane.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WOW!!!!!,"Updated 9/23.... wore these on the plane yesterday and the sound was phenomenal.

Original:  I have to say, I can see why these have such a great review.  I tried with the buds with the covers that came on them, then tried the smallest and by the time I was done I found that the Large gave me the best sound quality of all of them.  I guess it is not about whether it fits into your ear canal but how well it blocks our surrounding noise etc.  So far I am extremely happy with them although I did get a call and had to pull one of the pieces out as it sounded strange to me :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lowest volume setting still too loud,"At lowest volume still too loud. When I try to lower the volume, the sound goes completely off. There’s loud and louder, no soft quiet listening. I’m disappointed as I wanted wireless and quiet while listening to music during rest. Sound is crisp and clear with nice bass tones. I do like the sound during the day, but as I’ve already mentioned, they are too loud to be able to rest with music at the lowest volume setting. Plus, if you are wearing the ear buds while connecting to bluetooth, the volume will max out and sound blast your ears -that’s not mentioned at all in the instructions and I find that a bit dangerous for the inner ear hearing. If you wear glasses while wearing these, the blue flashing light reflected is rather irksome. Would have given 4 stars if they could be turned down; 5 if the there wasn’t a constant flashing light.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bluetooth Wireless Ear Buds on the market!!!,"I ordered these ear buds after seeing the 4,500+ reviews averaging close to 4.5 stars. This product did not disappoint and truly exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is crisp and clear.

Great bass and good sound how ever sound gets static if they detect you moving,We ordered 2 sets of these one for my wife one for me.

"Good headphones, just need more sound","I got these headphones because the last ones I had were wired and kept falling to one side so I had to keep pulling them back in place and they got shorted out. I like these because they don't have a wire. I wish they could get louder because I like my music very loud in my ears, but these are good enough. They don't always connect automatically to my phone which I wish they did, but it's a small problem that can be easily overlooked. Overall, I'm happy so far but I've only had them for about 3 days.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
1 week in and still happy,I bought these earbuds about a week ago. I am very happy with my purchase so far. They sound great and have been  trouble free for the most part. The first time I used them the left ear piece would cut in and out. I put them in their case and fully charged them and then did a reset and have not had the problem since. I have used them with both my cellphone and my PC and they have worked excellent. I only use them a couple hours at a time and then put them back in the case for charging and storage. Time will tell how durable they are.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love them!!!,"I've only had these for a couple days, but I put my stuff through the wringer. I carry the mail in Ohio and I use these to listen to J. Vernon McGee's Thru the Bible while I walk. I have already had them out in the pouring rain and they worked perfectly. I'm no audiophile, but I hate tinny sounding cheap headphones. I'm extremely picky, and that's why I sent back a set of the mpow BT earbuds, and another that I can't remember the name of. Both sounded very cheap. These have deep bass, and are very loud. I deliver mail on a busy 4 lane and have absolutely no problem hearing the sermons.

I am always moving and have never had one work its way loose. No need for adjustments at all. I put one in, and it stays where I put it. THE BATTERY IS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED. I only use one earbud at a time for safety reasons, so I use one until it starts telling me the batter is almost dead, and then I switch out. When you switch to the other one, you have to open the blue tooth menu on your phone and have it forget the one you are disconnecting and then repair the other one. Takes about 10 seconds literally. I'm just happy that you can use either one independently of the other one. The last pair I tried advertised that you could, but the right bud was the only one that actually connected to the phone. These TORO's are awesome. Work better than I expected to, and I will definitely shop with them again.

GREAT PRODUCT TORO. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but when someone puts out a better product than the competition, and then sells if for about 60% of the crappier one, I like to say thanks.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"GREAT ear buds for music, but not so much for phone calls","Just received these yesterday and haven't been experienced the battery life, so, I did not provide a rating on it. However,  the sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent IMO.

IMO, these can't be beat for the price!!

GREAT PRODUCT ALL AROUND!!!!!!!!,"Great earbuds.  I was in the market to change from wired to wireless earphones.  After extensive research on different websites, I ended up on Amazon.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews set the TOZO T10 apart from others.  I received them sooner than expected so that was a step in the right direction.  Let me say these are my first wireless earbuds.  Right out of the box, I put them on and the fit was comfortable and snug, better than expected.  I went for a mile jog and no issues either by not being able to listen to music nor coming loose and falling.  I also did not have any issues with incoming or outgoing phone calls, the reception was clear without static.  Very happy with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and snug fit,"I bought these for working out and for listening on flights.  That's why I need my earbuds to block out outside noise and these do a great job.  The sound is better than I expected for earbuds much cheaper than the ubiquitous Airpods. Nice deep bass response.  The fact that they can charge wirelessly and with a micro USB cable is a plus.  My only wish is that they connect automatically to my iPhone X.  Although they pair automatically, you still have to press ""Connect"" under your bluetooth settings.  I got the white ones and they look great.  Very satisfied so far and will update if they break down.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones!,I’ve had these for a few weeks and wanted to try them out in my daily routine. I love the charging case and use them for my job making lots of calls during the day. The sound quality is better than if I had my phone on speaker and my clients can hear me well. As for music you just have to get the right angle in for them to stay and voila you have great noise cancellation and sound! I might still play around with the ear bud sizes when I go for runs as they can fall out if not placed in properly. Easy to pair and sync to your phone!

TOZO T10 Ear Buds have excellent sound!,"This is my first pair of Ear Buds and I think that they are amazing. The sound is very clear and the Bass is excellent sounding! I didn't know what I was missing out on! I read the reviews and researched them before purchasing and it's true, as many have reviewed, TOZO has done a great job with the design of these Ear Buds!

BEWARE...The ear buds I received are not what is in the description or picture..,"I am not sure what I received but the product mailed to me was titled ""TWS Wireless Earbuds""  and was not a TOZO product.

The case is different and the buds are totally different.  The box was also missing the different sized earpieces.

When trying to sync this knock-off product to my iwatch, only one side would work.  When syncing with my iPhone, both would work but then just heard constant static along with a constant cutting out in the right and left ear.

When looking at ""TWS Wireless Earbuds"" online, I found this pair I received selling for $14 on eBay.

Someone is trying to pull a fast one swapping out this product for cheaper product.  I will be returning these ASAP to Amazon and not purchase from TOZO ever again..",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It pairs with my Macbook Pro very easily too!,"The main advantage is how easily it is to pair with our phones, but it also pairs super easily with my Macbook as well. I noticed the range I can walk away from my devices with the earbuds doesn't go quite as far as my wireless headphones (from a different brand), but the noise quality is nicer for these and they're comfier to wear.

If you're a lady with smaller ear-holes or a child, I recommend swapping the fit out to the smallest size. That's what makes them the most comfortable.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Beware of unethical gaming of review system,"I just got this product and it seems OK so far. Good fit for my ears with the smallest ear pieces. Pairing was simple and easy. Seems to connect and charge quickly with my wireless charge pad. As for sound quality, my only gripe is that the bass is too strong. I wish there was a way to dial it back.

However, my main complaint about this product has to do with the reviews. I registered the product and immediately got an email informing me that if I would give them a 5-star review here on Amazon and send them a link to the review, they would send me a free wireless charger. In my opinion, gaming the system like this is unethical and should be banned by Amazon as it destroys the integrity and value of the process. So take the high reviews for these earbuds with a huge grain of salt.

UPDATE: ""Hanna"" from TOZO followed up my review with another email offering me a free wireless charger with no strings attached, just to make sure I was 100% satisfied. OK, sure. I responded with my address. Then I got another email telling me that they would ship the charger just as soon as I went in and revised my review and changed it to five stars. Haha. Nice try, TOZO.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great option for wireless earbuds,"I was a user of some Jabra Earbuds and one of them broke and to replace it was over $100.

Kept falling out,These headphones are great for the price. The only issue I had which is the reason I gave them away was they didn't stay in my ears.

I went all the way from my home in Brooklyn to the city, walked around & then went home & they were still working. My only complaint is I wish they were louder but it's probably for the best so I don't go dead because I really blast my music. They also come with 3 different sized earbuds which is great because I always need the smallest one. I was so glad these fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Audio drops are most annoying while listening to Queen,These earbuds do have many great qualities but all are trumped by one fatal flaw. They keep cutting out. Music will be playing along and mainly the left channel will die. Then it will come back causing the right channel to die. They will come back and play well for a few seconds maybe a minute and the. Audio drops all over again.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product at a great price!,"I have had the headphones for 3 days and have loved them so far!  Was really worried about fit because I need them for working out!  So far I have box jumped, did kipping pull ups, jump rope and push press and I didn’t even think for one minute about them shifting position or falling out!!  I also mowed the lawn with no problems!  They are also very light which is great for exercise!  I can’t speak to the life of them (which I pray lasts longer than my last pair of “sweatproof, very expensive earphones).  I purchased the extended warranty this time!!  So far, I’m a big fan!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy pairing - poor connection stability,"On the positive:
Easy pairing makes it easy for anyone to operate and the fit seems secure, although I have yet to workout with them. A few walls gave me connection problems at work, but that's to be expected. I'll be testing the range at the gym today and battery life on the trails this weekend. I'm looking forward to a solid wireless experience!

Update (all negative): Battery life was substantially less than expected, lasting only three hours (fully charged when starting). The connection was substandard with the signal fading out on the left earbud and the bluetooth source less than two feet away during a hike.

However, the poor signal issue seemed to go away as long as I wore my brand new magic hat (a basic hiking hat purchased at REI). I tested this theory 8-10 times at random intervals during my 10 mile hike - as long as I wore my hat, the signal was solid, rmoving the hat immediately resulted in a lost signal.  I fully expect to be able to communicate with aliens using this hat, although I'm not sure if the earbuds will be required. At least I'll be able to use my tin foil for other stuff.

I'd fully recommend the hat as a companion item, except that when I sweat, it drips orange/red drops of sweat from the visor, so I'd only give three stars for the hat, itself.

As far as all the other 5 star ratings for the earbuds, those seem fully related to the seller relentlessly pursuing and bribing people by offering a wireless charger for the non-working earbuds in exchange for a 5-star rating. I'd buy another magic blood hat before purchasing another pair of Tozos.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Absolutely Amazing Sound Quality!!!,"Got really tired of my popular ear buds falling out of my ears. Yes they were Airpods...
I read many many reviews and came upon these TOZO'S. The reviews on these are true! Took a chance and ordered them! Let me say my ipods don't even come close, chuck them in a drawer, never be used again. These TOZO'S are the best I've ever owned. They stay put in my ears with heavy mountain biking even when I'm sweating like a maniac. The sound quality is what got me the most. Deep big stereo sound with a punchy base took me to my own world. Long battery life and a wireless charging case is perfect. Put the right size ear pieces on my buds and they are super comfortable.

"Goodbye Tozo, hello AirPods.","I hoped this would be a cost saving solution to Apple AirPods or Powerbeats Pro.  I returned them after trying for a week and experiencing a few problems:
— they fall out of my ears no matter what fittings I use (4 provided). This has always been a problem with earbuds for my ears.
— when I do get a tight seal in my ear, it would not last very long, especially if bumped.  And to get the right seal in my ear I had to push it in to the point that it was airtight in my ear channel.  It would cancel out all notice at that point, yet wouldn’t stay in that position for long.
— they are automatically set to call your last phone number when you press the button 2 times.  I can’t begin to describe how annoying that is.  And I can’t think of a time in my life where I have needed that feature.  Much more helpful would be the double tap for “skip” which these earbuds do not have.
— wireless charging: this is great, and worked perfectly. A very nice feature: just set the case on the charger at night and bling!
— the Tozo’s also take a little while to connect to your phone.  I’ve tried my sons AirPods and the are instantaneous.  I found myself wondering: are they on? Do I need to restart them so they find my phone again?  But eventually they would pair up with my iPhone (maybe 20-30 seconds?)
—instructions are helpful but in a rough English that is imprecise and odd phrasing for American speakers to read.

Outstanding sound quality,"These wireless earbuds are fantastic. The various size ear caps are especially nice.  After installing the proper size for me they fit perfectly making them a nice snug fit.  I wore them for several hours without them falling out which was a problem for every other earbud I tried, wireless or wired.  Even though they fit snug and stay in place they remained comfortable.

When I received them I paired my laptop and listened to a Podcast.  Next I paired my cell phone.  No problems pairing either.

Decent for the price,"Overall, these are a decent pair of earbuds.  My biggest problem is they do seem to have a sensitive bluetooth connection.  When my phone is in any pocket, it has waves of spotty connection.  Usually it is ok, but if it skips once, it will usually continue skipping for about 30 seconds.  I mostly use these for the gym as my wired pair just gets in the way, and they work great for that.  However, when I'm at the gym, my phone is not in my pocket, but 20 - 30 feet away on a table.  It really seems like the pockets create way more interference than you would think.  A couple other things that could be bothersome:
- You can't have one earbud turned off or it will constantly beep until you turn it back on
- No function to skip songs or change volume without going to your phone.  You can pause and accept/decline calls, but having to go to the phone to control media is a bit of a bummer",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

-Suprisngly good sound quality for the price. The base actually was really good. Compared to my old wireless earbuds (Cheap) the sound quality was so-so. But this ear buds surprised me for sure. In a good way.
-Nice design. It can be bit bulky but it gets job done

Con
-short battery life compared to other major ones
-Bulky design which might not look as nice to some ppl.
-Lack of functionality such as volume control and voice recognition

Wasn't expecting such quality sound!,"I bought these headphones for the price and convenient wireless charging features. I wasn't too worried about sound quality, but it turned out to be maybe the best part of these headphones. I tend to stick to this price range for headphones and these have by far the best bass I've found, without feeling like I was going to blast out my eardrums.

The charging case is as advertised and super convenient, just charge the case ~once a week and it keeps the buds charged for my use (about an hour at a time, 4-5 times per week).

The only cons I've come across are: the buttons on the side don't allow for many controls. Really just play/pause, on/off and accept/reject phone calls. Previous/Next track and volume up/down would be great to have.

Customer service has also been top notch!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Downside are what I’ve experienced to be a so-so microphone, and they hurt my ear a little bit when I point them upwards as instructed, so I turn them downwards and they don’t hurt.

Left earphone cuts out,"The sound quality is great, when both ears are working together. But about once every minute or two the left ear drops in volume, or completely cuts out.

But didn’t want to be one of those guys with the white ear buds dripping out of their ears. Bought these based on the reviews and have been extatic so far. Have them paired to my Apple Watch and they sound great and connect immediately. My wife even stole them from me and didn’t loose connection in the other room.

Was expecting some sort of comprise but have been unable to find one so far. They sound as good or better than my Jaybirds, my Powerbeats and my Anker Bluetooth buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disconnection between ears major issue!,"I really wanted to like these, so I'm going to keep it short and concise.

Build quality is very good for the price, both the ear piece and charging case.  Fit in my ear is pretty good but they feel a little heavy and bound to fall out (they do with any activity with some bounce)
Unfortunately I've been using them for a week now and they keep disconnecting for about a second and my music drops.  Really kills the consistency and vibe.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Must have waterproof earpods alternative,I was looking for wireless earbuds to use in the Hot Yoga room and for swimming as my original earpods (Apple) are not waterproof.  These paired up straightaway and provided awesome quality sound. I love the sturdy charging case.  The signal is lost if you duck your head in the water - but for my breast stroke it is perfect.  Different ear canal sizes can be accommodated to make sure they stay put; but I recommend wearing a swim cap for extra measure,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very pleased,"These earbuds had great sound, but they could not hold a solid connection to my Galaxy S9.  If my phone was in my shirt pocket, the connection was usually good, but if my phone was in my pants pocket (front or back) I would get frequent drops and almost instant re-connection.  Sometimes the earbuds would drop connection if I turned my head one way or another.

Updated 5/7/19:  The seller contacted me and belives that I may have received a defective pair of buds.  They are rushing out a new pair to me, and hopefully they are correct.  I will give a full report on the new ones, once they arrive.

UPDATED 6/1/19:  I received the replacement earbuds from seller and I have been using them for a couple of weeks now.  The new pair have performed flawlessly, and I am very pleased with them.  I am very impressed with the seller's efforts to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  I am upgrading my score to 5 stars.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for the price,I bought these earbuds to replace a pair of headphones that would fall off my neck while laying on my back. So far they have been way better than expected for the price point. They come with a great little charging case and an assortment of different size earbud covers. The only feature that they dont have that I would like them to have would be volume and next song/skip control on the buds themselves( you have to use your device to control those features). Other than that they have been great.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound and bass. Compatible with Apple EarPods !!!,"I was skeptical at first as I was debating on the EarPods or a cheaper alternative. I stumbled on these headphone and looked up the other reviews and product description. My ideal headphone has to have crisp sound quality and bass. I usually listen to dancehall, reggae etc. upon purchasing these I received them the nest day. And looking at them I can instantly tell these are durable and for $50 I was surprise. Just to make this review short and stop babbling. If I was to compare these to any headphones for the sound quality and all that. I will definitely say these are just as or even better than the EarPods!! The bass and everything is amazing. Thanks to the individuals that engineered these headphones!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Good value earbuds, some issues with Bluetooth pairing","These have very good sound quality, and I like the convenience of wireless charging. The volume levels are good (I use these under ear muffs for mowing) and they stay connected 95% of the time.

The only issues I've had have been the pairing of the Bluetooth; when using both earbuds, they do not automatically pair with my Galaxy S9 like everything else does - you have to pair them manually on the phone; and sometimes they even don't pair with each other out of the charger box - I have to put them both back in the case and pull them out together again. If I want to use just the right earbud, it won't pair with the phone because it is looking for the left earbud first and hangs there, requiring several iterations of ""back in the box"" and pairing again with the phone.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

to me

Dear Valued Customer,

This is Levana from TOZO. Your warranty registration about T10 wireless earbuds have been activated.

The wireless earbuds supports wireless charging, so in order to ensure that you can fully enjoy our great earbuds more conveniently, if you agree, how about we provide you a new wireless charger for free?

Don't worry, it is totally free for you.  We just want to ensure that you are 100% satisfied with 5 stars shopping experience on our great sound earbuds and service.

The first time I used them I was outside in the open lining my side walk with bricks. I had my phone sittin on my 25 foot side walk in the middle. I took two steps away from my phone and my music started cutting in and out, again this is a wide open area NO obstruction to block signal in any way.
Wait it gets better. on several occasions I was sittin right beside my phone within 3 feet of phone to ear peices and you guessed it my music would cut in and out. at one point I even put the phone directly on my lap and the music still cut in and out.
However when the music does play It does have a good quality sound to it!
Dont be fooled as I was by the over inflated reviews just so you can get a free wireless charger! These are nothing but trash and waste of your money!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good headset, great price.",I went looking for headphones that I can use while walking at my local in door pool and read some reviews and decided to try these out. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound and the range it works in. I was able to link it up with my IPad as well and listen to some recorded shows as well. I can take phone calls in my car from speaker to private just by putting in one of the headsets. I’m happy and have recommend it to family and friends.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

1 YEAR WARRANty,"I have been an immovable client of apple, but after trying the AirPods I realized that the AirPods fell out of my ears too frequently, so I decided to go with samsung level active this was fine in my ears but the cable is annoying especially when I'm running
so I decided to give a TOZO T10 a try to my surprise these fit my ear well but my biggest surprise is the sound better than apple, the battery lasts much longer than samsung,
you can't go wrong with these beauties",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for the price!,"Had the Airpods, but was afraid to wear them when working out. They never did fit my ears properly, and had to constantly adjust them, there was a few times when they fell out. The TOZOs fit snugly in my ears, and because of that, I can now wear them when I'm cutting the lawn, or driving the forklift at work. When I'm mowing the lawn, I can now also hear what's playing on my phone. Good value for much less than Airpods",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High Quality Wireless Earbuds On A Budget,"Just received my earbuds a few days ago but so far I’m in love. Build quality seems like high quality on the earbuds themselves, as well as the included charging case. The packaging was also very nice and gave the product a sense of quality over cheap bulk packaging on some other products out there. Only thing I noticed was when I turn certain ways the left earbud cut out for a fraction of a second, but only noticed it once. Could’ve also been due to the Bluetooth signal on my iPhone. But so far I rate these headphones 4 out of 5 stars. They sound great and appear well built, especially for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones!!,I have been using these headphones to work out in for the past few weeks. They have great sound and don't fall out as easily as I thought. I do run at a good pace for about a mile and a half. They will start to work their way out occasionally but once you push them back in a couple of times they are fine. While I work out they are great and just what I was looking for. The case is really nice and will charge the headphones quite a few times before you need to recharge it.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Constant beeping sound.... Don't buy,"The earbuds sound pretty good but it's hard to enjoy the sound when you have a constant beeping in your ear every 5 seconds. I've tried disconnecting, reconnecting, reconnecting one at a time, reconnecting both at the same time...... If I only have to use 1 on, I can't get rid of that beeping sound. And I just realized my return window has ended. So frustrating.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and great value!,"I just got these ear buds and my first impression is WOW!  They sound amazing.  The last pair I tried from a different manufacturer kept cutting out.  These never did in the hour I wore them.  They are also extremely comfortable.  I usually get ear fatigue after about 30 minutes with most earbuds.  Not so with these.  Also they stayed put very well even when I shook my head trying to dislodge them.  Fir the price, you can’t go wrong.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the 50 bucks.....for 30$ if they are on sale maybe,After returning the first set...I'm still disappointed. If the phone sets on the bench in the shop I can walk around a good 25 foot area. If the phone is in my pocket I lose connection....I purchased an arm holder...works better....still for the cost..i guess they are ok.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good wireless earbuds at a decent price.,"Purchased my Tozo wireless earbuds around 3 months ago and I've truly enjoyed the sound quality these earbuds have provided. Good sound, and fit great. The best part is no wires to accidentally hit or pull when doing chores working out etc. They stay in place and from my experience so far stay charged for most of my long running activities. When you're done, they go back into their very conveniently sized charging station, which keeps your earbuds in a safe area from being damaged. I would certainly buy these again, and for roughly 50 dollars you aren't going to find a better pair for this price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprisingly loud and clear - worth the money.,"I've tried other wireless headphones but these are a step above in terms of sound quality and volume. The manual is in a very broken English which had me worried at first-- however the headphones are great. Half volume is plenty most of the time-- which is unlike any other wireless phones I've used.

I wear them running on the treadmill, lifting, commuting, etc. They have only fallen out a couple of times when changing my shirt and knocking them out.

Battery life is also as advertised and the rechargeable case gives them a good 2-3 full charges.

They claim to be waterproof but I've yet to put that to the test...

Easily worth the money. One caveat I have is the functionality of the buttons-- a double tap redials the previous call and I have no use for that myself. Nonetheless they are pretty great true wireless headphones.,",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent earbuds for sport,"Pros:
-Sound is great. I'd say even deep
-It sits good in my ears (shadowboxing, running, cycling, even when I jamming my boxing dummy with full power )
-Looks durable. (didn't test waterproof trait though, by I'm sweating like a pig so.. seems like they are)
-Charge is decent
Cons:
-Box is kinda big
-Buttons is too hard to press and I pierce my ear when I do it (I guess because of waterproof trait)
-Sometimes I need to manually connect it to phone

Overall I recommend it to active people.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love it,Used it for 3 days now and love it - bass is really good (at least for me) and better than the other earbuds I bought.  have had no issues now connecting and works very well. Battery life looks decent also and the wireless charging is a major plus.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bluetooth earbuds out on the market and amazing customer service!,"I have never owned bluetooth earbuds and was hesitant to buy these ones from TOZO- what if the sound quality wasn’t all that good? What if the connection was bad? What if the earbuds didn’t fit my small ears?

Let me tell you, these earbuds are everything and more you could possibly need from bluetooth earbuds. At first I found them uncomfortable to wear, the smallest size earbuds were still too big. I reached out to TOZO and they had an amazing and fast customer service team that helped send me an even smaller earbud size for free! After registering my product for the 1-year free warranty, TOZO actually reached out to me to send me (you guessed it) another free item but this time it being the wireless charging pad and I quote “to ensure I was completely satisfied” I already was but now I'm just over the moon at this point- guys, this company not only has really good quality earbuds for a steal of a price, but also amazing customer service; so if something doesn’t seem to be working for y’all, contact them, don’t just get frustrated and return it, this company is like no other.

As for the actual product review:

As someone who has small ear canals, I was worried these earbuds wouldn’t work for me, I was wrong. With the multiple earbud sizes, you can be guaranteed something will fit!

And the connection, I read that some people had horrible connection if they had the slightest obstruction to their master earbud or their phone- for me however, I walked all the way across my house to the kitchen while my phone was charging in the guest bedroom and I could hear my music just fine and with that being said, I was washing dishes and waters always loud but these earbuds have awesome noise canceling.

More on noise canceling; I share a room with my boyfriend and sometimes when im trying to study and listen to music while he’s in a call talking to friends it can be very very annoying. I have never truly came across headphones that are what they claim to be with noise canceling- however, these earbuds do just that and I was shocked to find that I can see my boyfriends mouth moving and hear nothing from him- oh my god the joy!

I have yet to try these earbuds near water but if I ever do, I’ll write an updated review.

And last but not least, the carrying case/charger.

The carrying case is not only made to hold your earbuds but they do carry charge for I think about 4 times of full charging if you can’t make it to an actual outlet to charge them. The case is opaque so I can see the charge of my earbuds through the case without having to open them to check on them which is nice. And if you carry these out and about it does have a little area you can tie something to it and carry it to a bag or pants if you want- and its not too big to carry about, fits just nicely in the palm of my hands!

And as for the charging pad? It’s on it’s way here as I write this but I can only expect my experience with this product to get better from here on out.

(Also, I am so pleased with these earbuds I’m waiting for a couple more paychecks to roll around to get myself a second pair for work, would definitely recommend this product and the company!)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!,"A man at my gym was raving about these ear pods...I was intreagued, particularly about the waterproof part (he was a swimmer) as well as the price (my daughter had just saved up for airpods, and OMG!)

They came quickly. Sound quality is great; lots of bass though - ideal for working out!

I like that they charge in the box on a wireless charging pad and I like that they came with 4-6 different size ear plug sizes. (I ended up needing the smallest size, and they have never fallen out of my ears!)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unreal earphones at an unreal price.,"These earphones are much better than I thought they would be. I got them after my last pair of Bluetooth earphones stopped working (the kind with the annoying wire connecting them) and was worried about these falling out of my ears but they fit in perfectly and stay in even during jump rope exercises. The SOUND QUALITY is soooo much better than my las pair too and I don’t see why anyone would pay $150 for apply AirPods when you could have these. Excellent clarity on the lows, mids, and highs. These are top notch wireless earbuds. I haven’t tried them swimming yet, but I plan on trying that sometime soon. They also come with a year-long warranty which makes you feel comfortable actually trying them in the water! Unreal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound at a great price,"The ear buds provide great sound with substantial amount of low end bass. Pairs with each other quickly without fail. They stay in your ear comfortably while on a run. Hasn't had a problem with sweat or rinsing with water. I haven't had the confidence to take it into the pool yet. Hopefully, the battery will remain healthy for a long time.

BEST EARBUDS I'VE EVER HAD !,Myself along with multiple family members have purchased these earbuds. I have had several comparable ear buds from popular brands but these are the best. The highs are crisp and the bass is deep with no distortion. The call quality is excellent. I've tested voice quality on them while in the gym and no one noticed that I was talking through bluetooth. Battery life was my biggest concern but with the charging case and quick charging times that helped mitigate the concern. Overall these are some of the best on the market right now !,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A Must Have for Ear Buds...,"I have had 5 different Blue Tooth ear buds and was not happy with any of them, Until I received my Tozo T10 BT ear buds.

Not for small ears,"Overall these are just okay from a fit standpoint and great from a sound standpoint, I will continue searching for wireless earbuds. I have small ears holes so even with the smallest pair of plugs I can't get them to stay in. They also stick out of my ears in an off putting way. I need something cuter which can accomodate my small ear holes.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You get what you pay for.,"I've really got to stop buying stuff from no name Chinese companies.  It always boils down to, you get what you pay for.  Yes they are cheap, I love that they can charge via wireless.  The connection some times goes for no reason and doesn't always reconnect without manual intervention.  The battery in these doesn't seem to last as long as similar made Chinese ear pods, but they charge in their cradle very fast.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty Good but not Blown Away,"I like these a lot. They sound good and don't seem to fall out (yet). There are just a few downsides that keep me from giving 5/5. First, to keep them in your ear you really have to shove them in and it's not painful but it's not pleasant either. Next, to push the button either one you basically have to shove it more into your ear. Last and most important, the connection can be very iffy. The range isn't great and gets blocked if anything is in the way (including a hand). I will say this might just be my phone.
Apart from these few things, the headphones are great especially for the money. Overall, would recommend!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So Far So good,"So far So good, Just to get to the points, product came on time, nice packaging, one year warranty who does that on Earbuds TOZO, that's who, great sound quality no amazing sound quality, great price point, if not for price point I would give 4 stars because no volume control on bubs themselves, if volume control was on the bubs I would give a 6 star.

Good quality for the price,So far so good. I can’t really comment much on the battery life yet - I just got them. But the noise cancellation and sound are great.

Easy to clean and remarkable bass,"Got these for working out and hanging out at the pool, the ipx8 waterproofing makes them indispensable. Since the case if waterproof also I can just pour some alcohol into the pockets in the case, drop them in for a bit and just like they're sterile again. Nibs are snug and seem durable but easy to remove. Never heard bass like this from any earbuds. No noise cancellation but I find that feature somewhat disorienting anyway. Design is not ostentatious and they are a tiny bit smaller than I expected which is nice. Only thing so far I would improve is to make the left and right symbols on the buds a bit easier to distinguish. An overall excellent product. 1 year warranty included and another 2 years for two bucks - pretty sure that's called a no-brainer.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best value for the price!,"This is a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for the price. I am very impressed with the build quality. These are very solidly built and I really like the magnets that hold the earbuds in the case, and also in the lid of the case. They are not 100% reliable in connecting to my iphone every time without having to tap on the Tozo T10 on the Bluetooth screen, but this is not a deal breaker for me.  I would recommend to always remove the R earbud  from the case first, and then the L, and it seems to connect more reliably that way. The sound is not audiophile quality, but far exceeds my expectations for what this product is and the money spent.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good earbuds. Great sound!,"I was a bit sceptical about buying these earbuds but decided to give them a try since there were so many good reviews. I’ve had them for 3 weeks now and I’m very happy with them. I like them so much, I’ve already bought another pair as a gift for my brother.

Things I like:
- Sound quality is really good.
- Pairing is usually very easy.
- Range is great, in the right conditions.
- They’re comfortable. I use the small tips and they fit very well. Haven’t ever fallen out, but they do get loose sometimes if I’m moving around a lot.
- I like that I can use one earbud at a time. This is great for work.
- True Wireless is so much more convenient than any other design. Especially is you plan to use these often (workouts, house/yard work, washing the car, etc...)

Things that could be improved:
- Although pairing is usually pretty easy, it’s not very fast. Usually takes 10 seconds or so for the earbuds to pair with each other and then with my phone.
- They look a bit odd while wearing them, because they stick out a little. Not terrible, but don’t look as sleek as the airpods style.
- Not sure why, but the signal seems weak or interrupted when I’m working in the yard with any gas powered equipment. Gets a little staticky. Also happens if I bend down to pick something up.

Overall, for the price, you really can’t go wrong with these earbuds. It’s a very well made product. I would definitely buy them again.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really good wireless earbuds at this price,"Sound - It is really good as compared to other earphones I have. Bass is also good, as needed for EDM.
Battery - It runs around 4 hours which is pretty good. The battery case is available to charge if the battery runs out.
Grip - It fits perfectly in the ear and also has earbuds of other sizes so that people can change it according to their needs.
Noise cancellation - It is very good as I asked the person on the other side, and he could not differentiate whether I was using earphones or talking on normal phone.
Pairing - It is really easy and is very fast. As soon as I take the earphone out, it pairs automatically.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty good,"These are the FIRST earbuds of this kind that I've used where i haven't had ANY dissconnect or glitchy issues. So far anyway. These have pretty good sound quality, pretty good bass. The only downside to the sound is that these earbuds don't like symbols on drums. They come across as staticy on most songs that have high hats and symbols.

These don't have the best sound quality but considering these are the first rechargeable case wireless earbuds I've bought without connectivity issues i love them. They have more bass than the $160 jabres. They sound amazing with audio books. One kind of annoying thing is that if you don't turn them off before putting them in the case they will constantly discharge, killing the case battery",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for wireless earbuds.,I am happy with the sound quality and now I'm happy with the overall performance of the system.  I had some issues with the first pair having a poor wireless connection between the left and right earbuds.  Bluetooth connection to the phone was fine.

I'm pretty happy with the purchase.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The best by far!!!,"These are the by far the best wireless headphones ive had as of yet! Pros and Cons as followed by:

Pros:
1. They hold a 3 hour charge
2. Have a fairly nice comfortable fit
3. Bass is definitely on point when it comes to volume
4. recharging base is a decent size and making it magnetic also gives you a little more security if you drop the case ( has happened to me )
5. No real issues with connecting to blue tooth using a Samsung 10+
6. You can shower with them! If my speaker dies i usually use these but make sure to dry them off and let them sit before putting them back in the case ( i try not to do this often )

Cons:
1. (As for most and unlike some devices that are completely wire free) youll find yourself in the dog house if any components go missing or are damaged.

2. (not to sure if its true but wouldnt test my luck) the charging case or headphones are definitley not fragile so make sure to not drop them or put them in a compromising position.
3. Wish the range could be better, depending on where my phone is and if my phone is in constant movement ive noticed that my music playing will be interupted abruptly.

Summary: unless i miracolously find better blutooth wireless head phones then these are my go-to for the season. Affortable and definitely worth it for daily use.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

poor microphone sound and connectivity issues,"This is my first pair of wireless headphones.  I purchased them thinking that they would also replace the Bluetooth headset that I use when making phone calls.  My job requires that I'm on the phone constantly.  When I receive a call, sometimes it answers automatically, this is NOT good.  I like to choose which calls I answer.  Another problem is that the person on the other end couldn't hear me.  I had to turn off the headset and pick up the call. I also like to use one earphone at a time, this is difficult.  Oftentimes I just continue to get this beeping  noise while it is trying to connect to the one that I'm not using.

The sound quality is very good.  I'm going to give these a couple more days and see if I can get used to them, but if not, I will be returning them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for the price.,"Great sound quality, great noise cancellation but my only issues are 1) it takes too long to pair to the device automatically 2) the lack of ability to change tracks or volume. I only use these for running and working out, so it’s a bit inconvenient especially while running because I gotta take my phone out the arm band to change tracks or adjust volume, gotta make sure it’s all done beforehand. I haven’t tried out the waterproof ability because if it doesn’t work then God help me, I’ll wait until natural circumstances has its way.

Other than that, for the price you’re getting this especially compared to brands like apple and Samsung, it’s a good deal. 4/5 for me dawg",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Left earbud OR both Disconnects sometimes,Ehh. Sometimes both would disconnect and then reconnect within a second or 2 two. Sometimes it would just be the left earbud that disconnects and then reconnects. My old wireless earbuds never did this and they were CHEAPER! Definitely not pleased and also disappointed with the product. If it gets worse or continues I might have to return them and get my money back and buy something better from another company.

Got them for my teenage daughter - her not cheap wired Beats earbuds only lasted about 8 months, and cheaper wired options only lasted a few months at best. She's loving these - very convenient and the charging case works well and is easy to use. Her only feedback was that it would be nice to have volume control on the earbuds themselves. Great product, would buy again!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Very Satisfied with Purchase,"I primarily use earbuds for listening to music while running and working out.  First time buyer of wireless earbuds so I was apprehensive as to sound quality and I was seeking a product that remained stable in my ear while working out .  I have always used wired earbuds prior to this purchase.  My standard $30 dollar wired earbuds would last a couple of years before wires would ultimately break and loose sound in one of the ear buds.  Another issue with wired earbuds was the cords would eventually pull on the earbuds requiring readjustment to add slack to the cords and then press back in the earbuds.

I ended up purchasing the Tozo T10s given its features, reviews, and reasonable price.  1) I didn't want to have to worry about water or sweat impacting the earbuds. Given these have a waterproof rating of IPX8, I feel confident in not having to worry about them getting soaked.  2) Sound quality exceeded my expectations for price level - very clean tones with good base.  Volume level capacity is great given it will go louder than what I need even though I've had slight hearing loss through the years. 3)  Stability of staying put in my ears during running is very good.  No more cords pulling on the earbuds!  These are more bulky than my wired earbuds but they are fairly light in weight.  I encountered no issues with them coming unseated from my ear canals during 30 minute runs.  Occasionally, I will slightly press on them to adjust the seal pressure in the ear.  I love the freedom of having no cords!  Glad I chose to go with these over wireless earbuds that are joined by a cord that wraps around the neck.  Coworker mentioned cords on his wireless earbuds do become unbalanced and will pull on his earbuds when running. 4) Battery life is good - more than adequate for getting me through a couple hours of workout at the gym.  Love that the charging base has an internal battery that can recharge the earbuds several times when away from any plugins.

I would not recommend this product for phone use.  Given the location of the microphone being in ear, it has a hard time clearly picking up my voice.  Not a concern to me since I did not purchase this product for phone use.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Audio lacks frequency range unless you like tinny!,"While the audio is clear and crisp it is crisp as in no low to mid frequencies. Vocals all sound tinny and there is no bass at all. The snare drum and high hat cymbal is loud and clear if that’s your interest. I had hoped to free up the worship team from their earphone monitor console and I will get their input.  I’m sure I'll get a thumbs up for wireless freedom from their console but totally thumbs down for overall audio quality.  For what it’s worth, so far, I have only tested these earbuds with my iPhone and iPad. If I find anything new worthy of mention I’ll update this review.

Update: Bluetooth latency is unacceptably long. That may or may not be more a transmitter issue. From speaking into a microphone to hearing in the earbuds is a delay of maybe a second. For their intended usage of streaming audio the latency is not much of a issue but if real time audio is needed Bluetooth is not the answer.

Regardless of the latency, audio reproduction is terrible with no lows to mids.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very impressed!,I was very impressed with every part of this product. Case and additions that come with them are nice. The sound quality and battery life are fantastic. The appeal is sleak and light weight. Have nice features and are WATERPROOF! I am around water daily. I was looking for one that I could use as an ear piece while driving my work van and listen to music all while having an old phone that the speaker doesn't work anymore. This product cured my problem. The only thing is you need to read the instructions on donning them because it makes a difference when they are in correct.

It works. Only thing i dont like about it is the sound. Its not as good as the $300 ones.,"I like how everything works and the quality is top notch. BUT as soon as i started listening to my music, there was a scrathy noise in the background. So if you really dont care about quality sounds then by all means buy this. But i rather use my samsung with wire on it for a better sounds quality. Im still thinking about returning it. Never mind im keeping them after all. Pretty good for its price. If you really want a good wireless pay $200 or $300. Other than that ill give it 4Stars. I love the base on it. You will enjoy it while working out maybe. Or if you dont want to hear someone else talking.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good sound and quality... poor execution for wireless phones not having basic music controls!,"Just purchased these... so far quality seems good. They’re loud enough...  I like my music loud!
Something I don’t like, and TBH never thought to review because I assumed it would be a standard feature... music control.

There’s no advance/repeat song control! Which is ridiculous... maybe not a prob for the masses... but a huge disappointment for me.

I am an install tech, I do physical labor working with my hands all day. I don’t have the freedom or the desire to pull out my phone every time I want to skip or repeat a song!

So unfortunately, I will be returning these and looking for a pair that does have the BASIC controls ALL wireless headphones should have!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These things are great!,"I purchased these headphones on 12-August and promptly took them on a 30 mile cycling ride. Had been previously using a pair of wired bluetooth headphones and my first impression of the sound quality from the TOZO T10's was in how rich and full the sound quality was from these relatively tiny earbugs. It was very good with rich bass, solid midrange and high highs. The fit was great and the devices paired instantly with my S7. Listening on these has made me realize that there are differences in sound quality between the major streaming services. Very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the TOZO T10 to anyone looking for wireless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I am really impressed by these headphones....,"I have a few different types of wireless headphones and none of them have really impressed me.  So, I decided that I needed a really good pair and searched through Amazon and read a lot of reviews.  The reviews for these TOZO T10 wireless ear buds were really good and after reading about 30 of them I clicked the buy button and ordered a pair for myself.

The buds arrived within in a day and so far I have fell in love with these little babies.  First of all they synced up with my iPhone right away with no issues.  If you sync one of them, the other follows automatically, just give it a few seconds.

The sound quality if fantastic and they have just the right amount of bass so as not to make you go deaf.  The carry case is also the charger and you can charge them with the provided usb plug or if you own a wireless charger that will work just as well.

They are sleek and well designed and come with different size changeable ear buds that will fit any size ear hole.

For the price you cannot beat these buds and I would buy another pair if I needed them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
NO WIRELESS CHARGING!,"NO WIRELESS CHARGING.  I have numerous wireless dicks of different brands and this will not charge in any of them!
Update*** After my initial 1 star review the company reached out and offered to send me another set of buds and a free wireless charger!  I upgraded my one star to a two star because of the customer service!  However, I received a new pair of ear buds but the free wireless charging dock they were going to send as well was not in the box.  New pair of buds are sketchy with wireless charging.  Will charge for 5 minutes and shut off!  I then need to lift the case off of my charger and place again.  Yes it does wireless charger but not appropriately.  I will continue to charge via cord but do yourself a favor and try a different brand!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left channel drops in and out constantly,"UPDATE:
TOZO is sending a new set to see if the right channel was the problem. They are trying very hard to please me, including offering a full refund (return unnecessary). I opted to try the new buds because I really like the sound and how well they stay in my ears.
----------------
TOZO sent me a new left channel earbud when I told them about the problem with it dropping out. Only took a week to get the new one! After resetting the earbuds according to their directions, the newly reset left channel continued to drop out like the old one. It's possible that the problem is with the right bud, but they only sent the left. Most likely it's a bad design that only works for some people in some environments.

After some research it would appear that it is rare for bluetooth headphones to work right all the time, so Tozo is not unique in this aspect. I've read that Bose makes some that work, but the reviews on Amazon belie that. Since I own a set of Apple AirPods, and they work great, I know it's possible to design something that functions properly, electronically (AirPods slip out and are not water resistant).

There are several reasons why wireless earbuds might drop out on the left channel, but all revolve around the signal. Bluetooth transmits the left and right channels to the right bud (master), and then the right bud sends the left channel to the left bud (slave) via another bluetooth channel. Since most heads tend to attenuate the signal, very little signal gets through skin, skull, brain, and blood. It's better to get the antennas outside the ear so the signal can go around the head, so to speak. I suspect Apple figured that out and put the antenna in that little stem that hangs out of the ear.

It's sad that these TOZO earbuds don't work worth a darn since they sound rather good for bluetooth audio from an MP3 file, and wireless bluetooth is so convenient when out running, cycling, etc. So now it's back to the Apple AirPods that slip out of my ears. Ugh!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I don’t recommend this product.,"Received as expected. However I didn’t open when received. It’s been over a month since ordered, return allowance has expired and just tried to use.

Airpods 1/3 the price,"Great wireless earbuds for the money. They magnetically attach to the case to charge, which can in turn wirelessly charge or charge through the microusb port. Sound quality is quite good, I think it's as good or better than airpods, while this is 1/3 the price. Airpods technically have more battery life, but I never listen to music long enough for these to run out of power anyway, and they get over 10 hours or something when you're putting them back in the charging case every few hours or so. Comfortable in the ear, just gently twist to get a good seal. Depending on the size of your ear you may need to change out the ear tips (multiple sizes are included). Just connect to the right earbud and it will automatically connect to the left. Thanks, for reading, I've enjoyed these earbuds and would recommend them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Much Better Than Anticipated,"Let me start by saying these are terrific!  The build quality is solid, packaging and presentation are nicely done and the sound is truly surprisingly very good with much better bass than something this small normally has.  I'm very pleased with these.  I had a pair of Phaiser's wrap around Bluetooth earbuds and they were far more finicky and not durable.  So came here looking for a replacement and wanted something that could handle sweat and found the behind the wrap annoying.  So gave this shot and wow, these blow the Phaiser earbuds away.  The charging storage case is a great touch and a useful place to store these after a work out.  The only warning I'd make is these are tiny and dark, so if you drop one of them, which I did, they're not easy to find.  The unit comes with several sized ear cups,  the standard size turned out to be a bit too big for my ears, they include two sizes smaller and one size larger.  The smallest size works best for me.  So try them for fit before going on a run,  and change if needed.  I went with the standard size out and one fell out, when I began to sweat.  Wasn't easy to find in the early morning light, but did and no harm or issue with it.  I changed the cups when I got home and now the fit is more secure.  I'd buy these again in heart beat.

Excellent True Wireless Buds for about 1/3 the Price of Airpods,"I was skeptical at first because this deal seemed too good to be true. Good reviews on true wireless buds for only 1/3 the price of airpods?

They are super convenient, easy to pair/use, doesn't fall out of my ear (if you use the right size bud that comes with the product). What really does it for me over airpods is that it has isolation, no need to crank the volume up to cover background noise.

Excellent noise cancellation and convenient charging case makes the investment worth it.,"I’ve owned this product for 2 months and use them solely at the gym. They have fantastic noise canceling abilities as long as they fit tightly in your ear. Luckily they come with different sized earbuds and I recommend trying out multiple. As for sound quality, they sound exactly the same as a pair of $20 Bluetooth headphones I have owned the past few years. I was hoping for better quality considering their price point. It should be noted that they also have significant levels of bass. As for battery life, I have consistently used these earbuds for approximately 2.5 hours before they die. Typically this would lower my view of the product, but the included charging case makes keeping them fully charged very convenient. I would recommend charging these earbuds after each (>1.5hr) use to ensure they do not die in the middle of a workout. Overall, they are an upgrade for entry level Bluetooth headphones and are worth the investment if you don’t want to spend $100 or more.

This will happen NO MORE. These sweet little numbers connected to my phone perfectly with no issues. I love that there are different sizes available to use for a snug fit in my ears. I opted for the smaller size as even other ear buds would fall out of my ears. With my first test drive, I happily put on my music and the song drowned out the sounds of my daughter singing in the shower. They are truly noise cancelling. My husband was even impressed and is considering a pair for him. He mows lawns and can never hear his phone. The only downfall is the 3 hour battery life, which for a normal person, may be perfect.

Great product! Have recommended to my friends,"So far I’ve loved the headphones. Having the control of both headset’s with one unit independently is highly advantageous. For instance it’s easy to have one ear piece positioned in the ear and place the other ear bud in your pocket utilizing it as a simple remote. This is where having a microphone built into each headset become invaluable. Great product. Just buy it and enjoy 5 stars.
P.s.
  I’m sorry I forgot to leave an opinion on bettering the product. The ability to switch songs with the ear pieces would be amazing. Maybe by splitting the single button on the exterior surface of the earpiece Into two pieces. Granted it would cost more and that would be reflected in the marketplace. That said granted the products solid status and reputation, tacking on another $20 per unit w/ extra controls and features would not keep people from buying. #skipbutton",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

My Rating – Two Buds Up!,"I’ve been looking for a decent pair of earbuds for a decent price for several months. A few days ago, I just happened to come across these bad boys on Amazon and then spent a long time on YouTube checking out the reviews. The positive reviews far outweighed any negative comments. As we all know, you can’t please all the people all the time. I finally decided to “pull the trigger” and placed my order with Amazon.
I just received my new TOZO T10 earbuds. The pairing process with my iPhone was a seamless non-event. The enclosed instructions were a little lacking but my countless YouTube searches paid off. These are the first earbuds I have ever used and I totally love them. The fit in the ear canal with the “medium” ear cap is just right for me.

I want a headset to be loud, have bass and clear highs, these definitely deliver what I was looking for in earbuds. I am using the original silicone tips it came with but I will be swapping it out some comply foam tips I have for another headset.

When I first started to put them in my ears, I had to refer to the instructions to make sure I knew how to connect them by Bluetooth.
When you pull them out of the docking station, you just put the right ear in first then the left.

Powebeats 3 vs. TOZA T10,"I purchased my Powerbeats 3  8 months ago.  One they are not wireless but I did not mind.  They are usually $199 but Best buy was having a special and I got them for $100.  The sound quality was okay and they were fine for what it was.  A couple days ago one of the plastic ear hooks broke at the base of it and I took it back to Best Buy who told me it was still under warranty but that I would have to take it to an Apple store because they deal with the warranty stuff.
I took it to the Apple store and they said that it was ""physical"" damage and that they couldnt replace it or give me credit for it.
I considered upgrading to the wireless beats for $299 but after no credit was offered for clearly cheap rubber ear hooks I decided to look on Amazon for an alternative.
I found the T10's.  Ordered them in the Apple store after sampling the new wireless beats.  I got them today.  For 1/4 of the price these things sound just as good as the beats if not better.  Do yourself a favor and get these things if you are looking dor wireless headphones.  For the price these are definately a buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BEST bang for your buck for wireless buds!,"Was pleasantly surprised when I received these yesterday and tried them out for the first time...the sound quality is GREAT! My favorite feature is the noise cancelling, you can immediately feel the quality on them once you put them on. My wife was on the verge of buying a more expensive brand of earbuds, but once she checked out mine she immediately changed her mind. She's getting the same pair! :) One of my wisest purchases!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love these but there is one thing I hate.,"I bought these honestly because of the price and the amount of reviews,  but I'm happy.  I love how the work there simple.  Just take them out of box and put in ears and they pair automatically.  I also love how they turn off as soon as I put them in box to charge.  Everything is laid out perfectly and the sound quality is as good as it gets.  They could be a bit louder but I downloaded an EQ booster to fix that minor issue.  They're plenty loud for most people but I listen to screamo music and I like it to loud as heck.

One other thing I would like to add I like is the comfort.  These stayed in my ears without issue while riding a bike,  stairclimbing,  and running .. No issues whatsoever.  I have small ear canals so I used the smallest ear foam and they stayed put.  Just make sure you twist them so they're sitting properly in ear.

The one thing I hate about these is the inability to skip songs and raise and lower the volume from buds.  I have bluetooth earbuds from 5 years ago that can do this so this frustrates me.  I guess I could send them back but I'm not going to because I like how they look and sound so much.  If you don't have a need for skipping songs and turning up and down from the buds then your golden.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for heavy use by university students,"I love these earbuds. I'd recommend them to anybody who is looking for solid sound quality and noise cancellation but prioritizes durability for heavy use (such as university students like myself).

Recently my Jaybirds died on me; I had used them for 3+ years for listening to music when I walk to class and exercise, cancel out noise when I sleep, and make calls. I was looking for something that could last me a while at this level of heavy use while providing good noise cancellation and decent quality.

When I got these I was immediately very pleased. I have very weird ears that most Apple products and other ears buds don't fit. These fit great, stayed in, and were hardly noticeable. The pairing process was also very easy.

The sound quality and noise cancellation is good and easily comparable to my $100+ wired Jaybirds. The call quality is decent but nothing to write home about. It won't blow your mind or anything but it is definitely more than sufficient for me.

I've used them for close to a month constantly and have had no problems. I am especially impressed with the battery. I charge the case at night and wear the earbuds when I sleep. When I set Spotify to a 30 minute sleep timer there is still plenty of battery to get me through my morning walk to class. I rarely use the whole case charge in 1 day, even with 2/3 hours of intermittent use.

I also love how they are water proof, something that I did not have previously with my Jaybirds. When I shower in the dorms late at night sometimes I don't want to play my music out loud publicly, and these have worked great in the shower directly in water.

My only nitpicks would be that there is no skip song button, extreme extended use can hurt your ears, and the volume doesn't go that low. The skip song button is not a huge deal, it just means having your phone accessible if skipping songs is something you do. When I sleep I like to put the earbuds on min volume, which on these is significantly louder than on my Jaybirds. With that said, so far it hasn't hindered my sleep. Additionally I think I slept on my right ear one night and developed a blister on the back of my ear. To be fair, I wear these things up to 10 hours a day, and I don't think there is a single design out there that would not hurt after THAT much time. Plus I just slept without them for a day or two and I was back to normal. So if those issues don't sound major to you, I see no reason why you shouldn't get these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Everything is amazing! Price, sound and company!","Wow! These earbuds are amazing. The sound quality and noise cancellation are like no other earbuds I’ve had before.

Very comfortable & perfect for the office or workout,"Purchased these for the ‘open office environment’ and love them! Fitting them snug in the ear creates noise dampening and with music on, or listening to a podcast, that’s all I hear. The sound is incredible..love the bass..but sound quality is dependent upon how tight the buds are sitting in the ear.

Hmmmm..... Was asked to write a favorable review for free charger plate,"I count on reviews on Amazon when deciding what to buy.  I really was bothered to be asked specifically to write a favorable review (not just to write an honest review of my experience) to receive a free charger.  It made me wonder how many of the favorable reviews here were influenced.  I will post my honest opinion .. and NO... I am now not going to even ask for the charger plate.

So I have had a decent experience with these, but they are also the first pair of wireless ear buds I have ever bought and most of the wired ear buds I have bought in the past are less than $10.

So, compared to the really cheap ones I have had, these do definitely dampen sound around me and the sound quality seemed decent to me.  I have problems with them falling out, but if I really jam them in there and twist them against the ear cartilage, I have successfully used them on an elliptical.  Not sure how they would do with more jostling like jogging.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds great! Unless your at the GYM,These wireless earbuds are good... sounds great and the bass is good too. The only problem that I notice is.. the sound cuts in and out when I’m only at the gym! Weird right? Maybe there is a lot of interference with the equipments at the gym.. I was on the treadmill and then moved to different machines and the music keeps cutting in and out. When I started walking away from the machines and into the locker room and sauna the sound was perfect no cutting in and out at all. I would still recommend,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazingly clear sound,I have been using these earbuds for about a month and have taken them on several runs. I like the convenience of not messing with wires. They are easy to use. They immediately pair to each other when taken out of the charging case and then can be paired to the phone. I have an older Moto Z Play phone with Bluetooth 4.0 and have no problems pairing to the earbuds. Sound-wise they are too bright for me having too much treble. But I downloaded Equalizer FX and use it with the Bits MP3 Player and I can adjust the highs and lows exactly the way I like it. Once there I was very impressed with these earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good headphone can be Great!,"I wihs it was a little cheaper or may be I caught it at the pricey end of things in the Amazon world. Over all I am satisfied with the product. I have had it for a few days and am pretty happy with the form factor. My ear plugs are the ones that came fitted on the ear buds out of the box so I havent tried out the smaller one which I should. Over all battery life is pretty spot on 3.5 hrs it doesnt take too long to charge. I have not tested how long it takes to do a full charge but it should be a whole lot.
In terms of missing features or not so great features: The micro phone is not really great could have been definitely better for the price I have paid $50.00 and there seems to be NO volume control on the device itself atleast i could not find any. Call receiving is a little hard since you have to press down on the device which can hurt your ear a little.
Over all its a great device design needs more thought.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Waterproof & Wireless,I like that there aren’t any wires to worry with or have to break like my Bose that only lasted 1 1/2 years.  These fit nicely in the ear.  I have very small ear canals and I use the smallest bud.  I do have trouble with it fitting in my right ear because my canal is super small and crooked so the noise cancelling isn’t quite up to par for me.  The sound is good but a little tinny.  I would like to see an app to control the volume and bass.  I’m loving that these are waterproof as I run everyday rain or shine.  I give these a thumbs up especially for the price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Earbuds for the Price,I’ve been using Beats earbuds for a few years now and they started to wear out on me so I decided to get a new pair of wireless earbuds. I was skeptical at first because I got such great sound quality with my Beats and surprisingly these didn’t disappoint me at all. I have small ears so I was nervous that they wouldn’t fit or be uncomfortable but these earbuds fit great and the sound quality is good. I had a little bit of trouble pairing them the first time but figured It out quickly and managed to pair them with my iPhone and MacBook. So far I’m very pleased. I’ll put them to the test at work and see how long the battery life last at a full day of work.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good wireless headphone,"I tried them after my Anker were ripped apart by my dog.
I like they support wireless charging so you don't have to plug the case.
Sound quality is good but lacks a little base on low notes. Battery life was good and I never ran into issue. Calling is better and playing PUBG was awesome on ipad. It seamlessly connect with other apple devices at home and I think it is because of Bluetooth 5.0, which now has become standard in industry.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I Would Recommend It,Overall I would say it is a very good product I haven't tested the water resistance yet however I still recommend it regardless. One of the things I liked most is that it came with a strap for the wireless charger/case and the audio is very clear. The thing I like least is that the material used for the earbud tips hurts my ears a bit because I have very sensitive ears but u can always get replacement tips in a softer material so it isn't a problem.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Make sure your ears an fit the ear buds selection.,"For starters, none of the earbud sizes fit my ears well.  The closest size that works doesn’t work well.  I’m constantly having to push the ear buds back in my ears.  Very annoying during a workout. The sound quality is on the low end.

"They’re for hands free phone calls, not wireless music/podcast enjoyment.","They seemed pretty great until I realized the only things the buttons do are answer call, hang up, and redial. No volume adjust, no skip forward or rewind. I bought them to listen to music at work, not for making phone calls, and I can barely even do that because the batteries last about 3.5-4 hours before needing to be recharged. If you’re looking for something to make hands free calls with then this product seems like it’s a pretty good choice. If you want them only for listening to music listening then definitely look elsewhere.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of buds for a good price,I have really enjoyed using these buds. The range on them is quite decent as well. I can leave my phone on my desk and walk around my office without dropping connection. I will say I have had some signal drop once or twice will walking outside however. I believe this is simply due to the radiant transmitters in my office's parking lot though. Overall great set. Wires charging a bonus.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Waterproof earbuds with good sound,"Just bought these earbuds and am really enjoying them. They stay in very well and block sound well. The music comes through very clearly. They are waterproof, I tested them in the shower and ran the waterproof case under the faucet. I haven’t tested how much they can be submerged since Bluetooth doesn’t work underwater, but you don’t have to worry about accidental splashes.
The Bluetooth between earbuds has enough range to stay connected when you have them in. The buttons control calls and play/pause. You can connect one earbud at a time without continuous beeping if you take them both out first.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great aid while swimming laps.,A pleasant surprise how great the Tozo T10 is.  This product was super easy to set up.  Basically plugged it in and when I put it on it immediately hooked up to my iPhone. I use these while swimming laps.

Long baterry,These buds are awesome.  I can use one at a time or both.  Either the left or thr right will connect.  It connects to multiple devices simultaneously.  Battery life is about 3-5 hrs but the best part is that you place them in the holder and they recharge without attaching them to the outlet.  I can go 4-5 days without charging the whole set.

TOZO T10,These ear buds are great sound  and battery life is awesome. But try as I did they would not stay in my ears. I used all the different sizes that ca.e with them.

No issues at all pairing with my iPhone or iPad!  The sound quality is great and clear!  The only thing I wish it had that I haven't been able to figure out is how to mute other than using my phone.  This doesn't change my rating since the phone has to be within a certain distance.

good for cheap price,"Pro: Works good enough for my ~1 hour long runs and was cheap. I only wear when running, and I am content with the product. They stay in perfectly when I'm not sweating ( I wear the largest size earbud covers), and I love the sound quality as well as lack of background noise.

Cons:
--When I run, I strap my phone to my lower back. If I turn my head right/left, the bluetooth cuts out for a few seconds. Thus, if you are a runner who hold your phone in your hand (i.e., not stationary) I imagine you might experience too much cutting out.
--I have to wear the largest size earbud covers, and the earbuds become loose when I begin sweating. When I go on light runs and am not sweating, everything's perfect. When I sweat in a normal run, I have to readjust my left earbud about every 10 min (my right ear tragus is pierced and thus the earbud stays in perfectly). This 10 min adjustment of one ear is not annoying to me, but might be to others.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best cordless ear buds I’ve ever owned!,"I’m finally free from the cords!
I love these earbuds. They are the perfect size (small, yet not too small) and the sound they produce is clear from the highs to the deep bass notes.
The single step pairing process is as simple as advertised. You just pick the earpiece up from the charger, and as you insert it into your ear, you will hear it announcing its connecting. That simple!

They hold a great charge and when run down, easily recharge in the charging kit in only an hour or so.

It does its basic job for the price.,"Firstly, make sure to read the manual. For example, you should always connect to the right Bluetooth.
Pros:
Sound quality is great.
There are 4 different sizes and one of them should fit your ear.
It cancels the outside noise.
I have not tried the waterproof feature yet but it is great to have it.

Cons:
It takes around 10-15 seconds to pair with your phone after turning them on.
The microphone is not that good but I think it is expected given physical constraints of them.
You cannot control the volume or skip songs. (I think they should consider adding a feature to the double-tap, like skipping a song.)

Conclusion: It could have been better but given the price, I am happily using them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Waterproof bluetooth headphones.,"TL;DR: noise-canceling works, definitely waterproof (but don't wear them under water because bluetooth), price is a good deal (better than Air Pods), be aware that they are so small people might not realize you're wearing them and will try to talk to you, and don't wear them when you need to be audibly aware of your surroundings (walking in public, riding public transportation, driving).

I bought these because of the price. I searched for the best-rated bluetooth headphones on Amazon.com and found these. I could not bring myself to pay $150 for Air Pods. I just can't. These are typical noise-canceling headphones, which I actually don't like, but they work very well. They come with different sizes of rubber earpieces, so you can find one that fits you best. I took the smallest ones and still couldn't hear anything with them in - anything besides the headphones. I was a little confused by the instructional pamphlet about how to connect the headphones, and that the Right one will connect to your device and then the Left one connects to the right one... blah blah. This is not actually how it played out in real life when I took them out of the box. No matter, as they were set up in a few minutes. I paired my phone with the Right one and then the Left one caught up. It will still show up in your list of devices, but it won't connect. Don't worry, like I did, that this means something is wrong. You can't connect to the Left one.

I wore them in the shower. The pamphlet says this is okay, and I can confirm, they work in the shower. They are very small and unobtrusive. They work very well on phone calls. One issue could be that since no one can see the devices in your ears (if you have long hair that covers your ears), you may have people come up to talk to you while you have them in and they don't know that you have them in. You won't be able to hear them talking to you because of the noise-canceling feature.

I don't recommend wearing these while walking alone at night, while walking across busy streets, while riding public transportation, while driving a car or in any situation where you need to be aware of what's going on around you, as you will not hear it. The rubber earpieces fit so well in the ear canal as to block out any outside noise. They do also have the noise-canceling feature. I'm not an audiophile so I can't analyze the quality of music playing. If I can hear it, that's good enough for me.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Earbuds ok, customer service excellent","This product was for my husband since he travels for work and needed hands free calling. We wanted an alternative to the very expensive Apple air buds. Although the design and concept are nice, they didn’t fit as comfortably as expected and seemed to fall out easily. They do come with different size ear “plugs”, so that could be user error. The sound quality was decent and battery life also ok, not superb.
Although the product itself isn’t great, for the price I think it’s fair compared to the market and we have friends that recommended these.

Lightening deal gone right!,"Iphone user. Wanted to buy AirPods, but did not want to pay their outrageous price. Saw this deal on amazon and decided to try it out. Sounds quality is great when listening to music! However when you make phone calls, the other person says it picks up a lot of background noise. To me it sounds great, but bothers the other party. Battery life is good (don't know how many hours). I haven't tried it while exercising, but I am sure while listening to music it is great.

Not good for running.,"I bought these earbuds solely for the purpose of long distance running. They just don’t stay in your ears or “lock in” somehow, even with every bud attachment I tried.
They’re a bit too heavy to stay in. It’s fine if you’re sitting at a desk, but if you start moving around they start to fall out & eventually do.
The sound quality is grand and they seem well made but I would NOT advertise these for athletic performance whatsoever. I kinda feel like I’ve been had.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Very, very happy customer!!","I've had my TOZO earbuds for about 3 weeks now and I love them. When I got them, I had to change the earbud shells (which are included) because my ear canals are small, but once I did I have never had any trouble with them falling out or feeling uncomfortable. The first time I put them in and connected them to my phone and started music, I was AMAZED at the quality of the sound, particularly the bases. I've never had any other earbuds or headphones that match the quality of sound, the comfort, the battery life, or the ease of use as the TOZO earbuds.

I was somewhat cautious when I was considering buying them because of some reviews that state that when they use them at the gym, the connection fails repeatedly. I only use mine at the gym and I've never had this happen. The signal strength seems to remain consistent and, once connected to any device, I've never experienced any drop in the signal.

In short, I'm incredibly happy with these earbuds and my purchase. They are probably the best things I've bought from Amazon in years.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not reliable long term,I used this for only 4 months before it started not holding a charge and was no longer reliable on a regular basis. Today was the final straw. I should be able to make phone calls and use it on my runs (longest run was 12 miles) but it keeps not working. I came onto Amazon to get them returned but apparently the window to returns is closed. I definitely DO NOT recommend if you are going to be using them for longer than 4-6 months.

great product. would buy again,"these are great. batteries last a while and especially since I store em in the case/battery I go about a month before having to recharge the case and i use em 3-4 days a week at the gym.

my ONLY issue with em after a few months of use is since I use em at the gym I'll occasionally bump one out of my ear and they're not always super easy to find against a dark gym floor, plus they tend to bounce and roll heh. but that's a rare occurrence",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound quality but short battery life,"I have listened to many headphone of different types and brands.  These are the best sounding out of all of them, when they are deep enough in my ears.  They sound very bass heavy (like its electronically boosted) but doesn't distort the sound.  The treble sounds prominent enough and not harsh.  They have good detail and sound stage.
  The main problem with these for me is they start to slowly come out of my ears after a few minutes of putting them in my ears (especially the left side) they then lose bass, audio quality and outside sound dampening.  I know many people don't have this problem so I won't subtract stars for that.  If anyone else has that problem I've found that wearing a head band helps a lot to keep them in.
  The battery life of both the batteries in the buds and the charger is low.  I have about 2 hours of listening time and the charger can charge the buds about 2 times before it needs to be charged again.
  The buds are not very comfortable, so I can only wear them about an hour and cannot sleep with them in.  I thought the button on the buds was going to be a soft touch button but you have to actually push it pretty hard in to get it to work.  The button can only pause/play the music, not skip songs or change the volume.  Speaking of volume, these have it in spares (when they are deep enough).  These buds are also very good at blocking most outside sound (again, when they are deep enough).  I love how they are waterproof so I can wear them in the bath.
In summery,  these would be 5/5 buds only based on there sound quality.  I wish all my headphone sounded this great.  The battery life and comfort subtract 1 star.

Good headphones if they fit your ears (see update),"The company reached out to me and offered to send a smaller model of their headphones, which I appreciated. However, they kept pestering me for an update on my review almost daily, even though I hardly had a chance to try them out. The headphones are good quality, but the seller will not leave well enough alone, and the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

These headphones sound good and work as expected. However, they are large for just earbuds. They fit larger ears quite comfortably, but smaller ears they do not fit properly, they do not sit properly in the ear, thus making them loose. Another drawback of this product is that headphones themselves don't have buttons themselves to pause/play whatever media you are listening to.

In short I would recommend these headphones if you do not have small ears, and do not need the ability to control your phone's audio from the headphones.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfortable and sounds fantastic!,"I really like these earphones! They are comfortable yet stay in your ear. I didn’t want to spend the $$$ for the Apple EarPods which won’t stay in my ear in active situations. The TOZO product comes with several sizes of caps so they fit well. Yesterday I was traveling at interstate speed and talking to a family member who also has an iPhone. With my TOZO earphones in, the vehicle noise disappeared and the sound was fantastic!

Not great....,"The sound quality isn't great, but the earbuds are pretty cheap so I expected that. However they also have a terrible Bluetooth connection. You can be holding your phone in you hand linked to your earbuds, and even a couple feet from the ear buds they cut out constantly as if you are 30 feet away.

Charging case doesn’t last long.,"I really liked this product, but the charging box doesn’t stay charged. I have to keep it plugged in to charge the ear pieces, which only stay charged on their own for 2-2 1/2 hours.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works and incredible for the price -- but lack of volume/skip is a real bummer,"First of all, I feel like it's insane you can get $50 Bluetooth headphones like these. So the value is amazing. They don't always automatically pair (I have to select them on my phone) and Bluetooth audio sometimes skips a handful of times an hour but that's fine, I chalk that up to Bluetooth in general. (And if I put my phone in my front jacket pocket instead of my side pocket, it never skips -- that's radio waves for ya.)

BUT the fact that I can only pause/play music by tapping the button, and can't change volume or skip... UGH. It's really annoying. I'm the type of person who keeps a big playlist of everything, and when a song comes on skips it half the time because it's not my mood... and this is while biking/running... so to really enjoy these I'm forced to create more separate ""mood"" playlists, which I guess is fine, but I'd rather not.

Instead I'd **much** rather have a double-tap do the next track and triple-tap go to the previous one, like other headphones do. (Right now double-tap makes a phone call, which is useless.) Even better, I'd happily pay an extra $20 if it had a touch-sensitive surface to tap and gliding would change volume. (Clicking the button in my ear puts pressure on my inner ear which is not painful exactly, but also certainly not comfortable.)

Also -- holding the charging case and feeling its weight distribution makes it clear that it's mostly empty space on the inside! So make it *smaller* please... it's too big to keep in your pocket, which is where you want to keep it. A slimmer version would make this even nicer.

The sound quality is meh -- serviceable but nothing special, and the bass is a bit too strong for me -- I actually pick the ""bass reducer"" EQ on Spotify to compensate a little bit, though it doesn't do much. I mean, I assume these are essentially $10 headphones with another $40 worth' of batteries and microchips and Bluetooth.

Finally the eartips are great -- I have large ears and so I can only buy in-ear headphones that come with large tips included, and these do. Honestly if Apple made AirPods with the in-ear seal like these, I'd buy them in a heartbeat... but they don't. (Don't know why... they used to sell in-ear headphones as an alternative to their normal ones.) But until Apple does, it honestly seems like these ones are your best bet.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A good pair of Bluetooth buds without the Bluetooth earbud price,"Likes: Nice compact design, nice charging case, good bass, noise cancellation is good, price

Dislikes: Wonky controls, battery life is a bit disappointing.

Just got these things. So far, they’re a pretty solid pair of earbuds. The sound isolation and bass are awesome. Connecting was a synch. Charging case is a nice size and has a magnetic lid. The charging case also charges fast as well. However, there are two things I don’t like about these earbuds. The first problem with these things are the way they fit in your ear. In my opinion, they don’t really look all that great (picture above). This leads to my second problem: the controls. Both earbuds can play, pause, and skip tracks. But I can’t press the button or else the earbud will go into my ear canal. So you would have to take out the earbud out of your ear, press it, then put it back in your ear.

Are these better than AirPods? The answer is no.

Are these better than other budget options? Yes.

Verdict: If you want a pair of good sounding Bluetooth earbuds, without breaking the bank, these are major go.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
32beans,"Pro - comfortable enough to use for my small ear.

"Decent earbuds, but not what you should be getting for $50","When I ordered these earbuds, I was ready to get excited. My last pair (a pair of ENACFIRE earbuds) had been great and for $10 more I was hoping to get a pair of earbuds that would be everything my previous earbuds had been with a little bit extra to boot (sound quality, I figured).

Instead, I just got more and more frustrated with the earbuds the more I used them. Here is what I experienced:

- When I put both of my earbuds in the case to charge, it would often only register one of them, and getting the other one to sit right in the case so it could start charging was a huge hassle.
- I’ve concluded that these earbuds are NOT designed with left-handed people in mind, as putting my phone in my left pocket results in a really poor connection between the earbuds and my phone.
- The connection is a little better when your phone is in your right pocket, but interruptions still occur here and there. When biking, especially with your phone in your left pocket, the amount of interruptions you get just from moving your head is unforgivable.
- This might be a mostly personal thing, but I found that none of the earbud tips included fit my ears. The medium ones were too small and the large ones were too large. I actually had to take a pair of tips off of a different set of earbuds in order to make them work.
- Another annoying thing: my previous earbuds (and I think airpods as well?) connect to the previously paired device within a couple seconds of taking them out of the case. These take like a solid 30 seconds to do so; I initially thought you had to re-pair the earbuds every time you wanted to use them.
- As others have mentioned, there is no way to control any aspect of your music with these earbuds, not even pausing, playing, or changing songs.

BIG RED FLAG: something that really bothers me is that after you activate your warranty, you receive an email offering you a free wireless charger IF you submit proof of a good review on amazon. Seems like shady business practice to me and explains the overwhelming number of good reviews.

As I said, these earbuds are alright. If you only care about sound quality, waterproofing, and battery life, these might be worth your money. Otherwise, I recommend finding another brand.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They’re fantastic seriously. The sound is amazing!  I have tiny ear canals apparently so have to use the smallest size buds (you get four sizes) but once I got the right fit they stay in really well.

"Quality Audio, Reasonable Price, Comfortable","I purchased these headphones after the death of my previous sets of wired headphones in a series of cat-related cord-chewing disasters: quite frankly, I had been avoiding bluetooth headphones due to the cost and because I expected the sound quality of reasonably priced wireless headphones to be poor.

Given the reviews on this product, I bit the bullet and made the $50 purchase, and I'm honestly very glad I did. The headphones themselves were relatively comfortable straight out of the box, but were better once I changed the earpieces. They stay in well; I haven't had them fall out while running, mowing, or working, and they are IPX8 so I also haven't had any issues with sweat or moisture. The noise cancellation of the headphones is also wonderful, as it's hard to hear anything with them in. This could be alternately a blessing or a curse depending on what you're doing, but they worked so well that I can't deduct anything from them for being well designed.

In terms of battery life, the earbuds themselves last for around 10 hours of constant music on a full charge. Not bad! Certainly better than I had anticipated.

Impressive earbuds,"So far so good. I’m very impressed with these earbuds, and It was a breeze to setup the pairing. Here’s a tip for getting the right fit - start with the smallest earbud sleeve, then go to next larger etc until one fits firmly and blocks out more ambient sound, so the bass sounds deeper. At this point the sleeve will also help with a snug fit. I pair it with my galaxy watch when I go jogging. And what’s cool is if you’re going walking or jogging with a friend you can share buds.

Poor Sound and Bad Fit,"I really wanted to like these wireless earbud, if for no other reason, they were my first and they were waterproof.  After all, what would be cooler than being able to take a shower with earbuds on.

However, I immediately noticed that they did not fit in my ears at all.  At first, I thought it was because the ear caps were too small but even after putting in larger ear caps and twisting the ear buds into ear canal, they still felt very unstable.  Even though they are not that large, the lack contour and the weight distribution just feels all wrong.

The part that bothered me the most was the tinny sound that they produced.  This disappointed me more than anything since so many reviews here said that the sound was amazing.  I am not an audiophile by any means but you will immediately notice that the bass is missing.  Another weird thing is that I could never get the volume right.  As a song would play, it would become very soft and then way too loud where it became uncomfortable.

Don't waste your money read my review,Connectivity issues all the time sound quality was extremely cheap the volume wasn't very loud there was like time when you're watching a YouTube video battery life was not good the color white is not good because it gets dirty easily and does not wash off almost like it absorbs the dirt or oil or whatever permanently after putting them in your ear you have to move them just perfect otherwise the sound cuz we're because it blocks your ear canal. I just bought a pair of Jabra Elite active 65t pair of earbuds they're $189 but every penny is well worth it you will hear things you never thought you would the point is you get what you pay for and these earbuds I am giving a rating on as for consumers who don't either have high standards or don't know what they're missing or can't afford anything better either go big or go home the best or nothing especially when it comes to you such a small microscopic piece of technology that you are putting in your ear sometimes you really just can't skimp out on just some words of advice,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Decent and affordable earbuds, but not waterproof.","The title is misleading: these are NOT waterproof, and it even tells you (amusingly enough, under the heading WATERPROOF) that they are not meant to be submerged in any capacity. This is relatively moot, as Bluetooth doesn't work very well through water anyway.

That aside, the sound quality isn't as good as Airpods, but the battery life is pretty comparable and they look pretty sleek. When you consider these are a third of the cost of Airpods, it makes them a pretty good alternative at an economic price.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sounds quality for a low price,Bought these for a trip to Italy. The sound quality is excellent and they really did cancel out a lot of noise on the plane.

Cutting Out,"Like many reviews mine cut out almost constantly. The left ear constantly drops, while the right ear drops the connection with my phone causing the music to pause.

Update. I contacted TOZO. They offered a replacement if I ""Could you please kindly post your kind experience about the product on the web page first？And then let me know the headline or screenshot  once post it.""

3.5 Stars if I Could.,"This does the trick. Calls sound good. Can listen to music- the bass isn’t that great, but it does the trick.

Last earbuds you'll need to buy,"These are absolutely amazing! Sound quality is great, the 4 different size options available ensure a perfect fit in your ear, & they are so super comfortable, I honestly forget if I have them in. I love the chargeable case. I simply charge the case through the night while I sleep, although it doesn't take long at all to get a full charge on the case, maybe an hour or two. Honestly don't know for sure, cause I've never had them die on me. I simply take the case off the charger in the morning, then wear one at a time throughout the day. When one earbud dies, I swap it out for the other, then well before that one gets the chance to run down its charge, the other one is charged & ready to go. You can honestly do that throughout the entire day, & still have charge left in the case before ever needing to charge the case. They are the best!! I've purchased so many that were great (some just ok) at first, but then quickly just quit working all together without any explanation why. I've had these a month already & have no complaints. Will update if anything changes. Pairing up with your phone or device is very easy also. It's labeled either R (right or both) or L (left only), & is so easy to pair or unpair, while swapping back & forth between the two throughout a day's use. I haven't found that the sound is any different when only using one earbud, like can be the case with other earbuds/headphones. I don't miss any sound/dialogue/background noise/music when only one earbud is in use, it's the same as if I were using both. There isn't a way to adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves, you have to use your phone/device. However, unlike previous earbuds I've purchased that started out with the volume level way too soft/quiet needing adjustment, these are perfect with a wide range in volume level. I suggest these to everyone who asks about them. Plus the company, tozo, is great with an extended warranty available & other amazing product offers. Like I said, hopefully the last pair I need to buy",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality and sound.,"I’ve used them once on a windy, 25 mile woods/road bike ride. The sound was excellent and noise cancellation is very good. Touch features are great as I have this connected to my IPod not my phone so I don’t have a need to take phone calls. The only issue I’ve been having is the connection. Almost the entire ride the buds kept cutting out. Now my iPod was a foot and half behind me in my bag so distance wise that was not the issue. I messed around with them in several stops but it kept doing once I turned them on again. This is frustrating because you want consistent music with no cut outs or interruptions. Not sure if I just have a dud or this is what to expect with something a little cheaper then the big names.

Update: 05/8/19

The company stepped up very nicely. I continued to have the cutting out issues with music no matter what I did to try and trouble shoot the problem. Contacted TOZO and they gladly helped me by offering some more troubleshooting help but then ultimately agreeing to send me a new pair to fix the issue. Top shelf, awesome customer service. I already enjoyed the product but I think this will put it over the top! Great product for half the cost of the super big names and the customer service is awesome.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty good. Fairly comfortable.,"I have a bunch of these cheaper little earbuds. I think I have 6 pairs of different ones. They're all damn similar. These are about the same as the others, but are water resistant. Sound quality is comparable among them.

For comfort, I'd say my E19s are a little more comfortable, but these are still very wearable. One thing, when you're using them singly, the one you're wearing beeps a few times after it connects to my phone, as if it's trying to connect to the other one. Then it stops and all's good.

I use these for audio books and podcasts so I can't speak to the music quality. I also wear them when I sleep to block my tinnitus and they're pretty comfortable to sleep in. I do wear them in the ear that I'm not laying on though.

I'd recommend these (all of them, really) for a fairly cheap earbud. For full disclosure, they're offering me a wireless charger or extra charging case as an incentive for writing this review. So that may have introduced some bias. But overall, I'm satisfied.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Almost perfect!,"For the price, there is a lot to like here!  The sound is plenty good for everyday listening at the gym or around town, although I suspect ""real"" audiophiles will want something more accurate.  But for my uses, the sound is great.  Fit in my ears is good, although I do notice slightly louder sound in one ear, and I think I need to try different size buds to get a better fit (the louder sound stays in the same ear even if I switch L & R, so it's not a problem with the T10 - the problem is with my ears!).  I like the compact case and the wireless charging is a nice bonus.  Battery life of the earbuds seems pretty close to the claimed 3.5 hours.

Just a few things that keep me from giving a full 5 stars.  One is that I would have preferred USB-C charging, just to reduce the different types of cables I have to keep track of.  Second is that these take maybe 30 seconds or so to pair with my phone (Pixel 3) when I take them out of the case.  Not a deal breaker for me, but just long enough to be annoying.  Next, I do get a slight audio lag when watching videos, which I have read is not uncommon with most of the true wireless buds like these, where the phone only connects to the R bud, as opposed to both L & R like some of the higher end earbuds.  Lastly is, if I leave the buds (fully charged) in the case and the case isn't plugged in, the *case* battery is drained after about 3 days.  So I can't count on the case being fully charged if I am heading out the door for a work trip or something like that.  Maybe the buds are constantly trickle charging from the case?  The case does charge back up fairly quickly, but it's still an annoyance.

Overall, a solid 4 star rating and I would definitely recommend these.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I didn't expect an $8 cheaper product to entirely blow away the competition--but TOZO TOZO T10,"I originally bought these wireless buds to use with my Samsung Note 9 (I wouldn't pay more than $60) for wireless buds, because I'll lose them, and the sound quality isn't going to get much better, until we're comparing these and $150 midrange closed-ear wired headphones.

Sound Quality:
I compared these against iKanzi T10, also purchased from Amazon. The silicone tips of TOZO's are incredibly good. They have a nice solid feel, and a large diameter (compared to iKanzi T10). All 3 of the ""waterproof"" silicon sizes are pretty large (all 3 sizes make an easy seal, which is the most crucial factor as far as sound quality is concerned when using in-the-ear buds (they are watertight--and marketed for active use around water.) These buds produce a rather balanced soundscape (they faithfully reproduce low-frequency sounds without ""boosting"".) The wide diameter drivers are able to produce rumbling lows that you really don't get to hear in this price range. I stress the importance of a good water-tight seal between the sound source and the hearing passages, as that wiill generally be the factor that determines the best fidelity--here's a reason why--sound is transmitted through air in the form of pressure waves. When produced by speakers or a PA system sound pressure waves move through multiple meters of open air. In-the-ear buds, such as these are designed to preserve the signal in a near-vaccuum. The seal allows pressure waves to move from the source to the innear ear undisturbed by things like walls, floors, people, other sound. Since the signal loss in this scenario is so low, much less power needs to be used to generate the clean signal. This allows me to hear what exact sounds are being produced during live performances, as oposed to playing blind ""understanding"". You'd preferably not want to use these as jreal-time monitors, as the closed design provides for a significant amount of passive noise cancellation.

Ease of setup and use:
Your biggest worry will be deciding which size gives you the best results. Buds like these are very easy to setup and use. Simply take both units out of the charging case--the left and right bud will automatically pair themselves to create a stereo BT connection. My Samsung Note 9 can provide me with the expected (10-13) meters of distance before the connection is lost. When you don't want to listen to sounds anymore, just take the buds out of your ears and place them in their magnetically enhanced charging case. The buds immediately disconnect and power-off when they are returned to the charging case. If you've already paired them to your device, you can resume listening by simply taking both buds out of the charging charing case. They will automatically pair to your last used device if available. Unlike most buds I've seen, these don't have a touch-sensitive tap system. The TOZO T10 instead ops for a click-button system. Downside is you need at least 2 fingers to ""pinch"" the bud, other than that, removing touch grants me an added feeling of stability, knowing that I won't accidently redial my last called number while.

Case design, large (2700 mAh) battery capacity (in the charging case). This case feels nicer than iKazi X9 charging case. The TOZO T10 case is much easier to open than the iKazi, as TOZO uses a magnetic seal instead of a hard-to-open groove designed for a fingernail. The charging case does have a very crappy lanyard (defective shoe lace ) I'd  recommend not using a lanyard to carry this case, or you will likely be missing something by a few days. The charging case itself is wireless-qc capable, and has one micro-usb input for cable-charging. I am so accustomed to using the earbud case to charge my nicotine vaporizer, I had to remind myself that I bought this item for listening to sounds, not to use off-label as a portable charger.

IPX8? IPX8 is an international code. IPX8 level devices are able to work continuously while submerged in water (up to 3 meters, but Bluetooth only h as a range of inches inside water--therefore these will not be usable under the  surface. IPX8 provides for continuous submerged use. Please note that this means the earbuds won't work if you swim with them (while under water) but they will not break from water. I don't know why anybody needs to have earbuds in the shower, but these will work in water, as long as the water isn't submerging the signal.

You will note the largest size bud is softer and larger than the others. This kind of bud is not designed for heavy movement.

Honestly Really Surprised,"I bought these because I needed a pair of headphones and I thought it would be nice to buy a pair that were wireless, but I didn't want airpods. I went searching and took a chance with these since they were only $50. The first thing that caught my eye was the packaging, it was super nice especially considering it was China. The next thing that really suprised me was the sound quality, it's honestly really good for $50, like Ive never tried airpods but I bet its just as good if not better. Noise Cancellation is also really good, I'm currently at a dining hall at my college and it has basically gotten rid of all sound around me, I can just barely hear the people aroubd me. The only thing that's bothering me is that I'm constantly having to push them back in my ear because I feel like they're falling out, but that might change over time and it came with out size earbuds so I might try those out as well. I would definitely recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good Sound, Good Value","So far, they work very well.

Best Headphone Deal of My Life,"These headphones are great and are everything I was looking for.

They lock in magnetically and automatically connect to your phone when you take them out. I've owned other ""wireless"" headphones (that had a wire connecting them), and the sound quality on these is vastly superior. There is a decent base with these, something you rarely find in headphones of this size, let alone wireless. I showed them to my neighbor and he had me order him a pair.

Amazing bluetooth headphones that don't break the bank!,"I bought the white version of this product and i've been using it for about a month now and this is just an all around great  product. The white design is very sleek and I've gotten a few compliments about it. There are a lot of pros (+) to this product and some cons (-), which really dont affect the product quality too much.

(+) Great sound Quality and volume. I play these at maybe 1/3 of the volume i used on my old bluetooth headphones. The quality itself is very crisp, clear, and all over balanced.
(+) Noise ""cancelling"". Although this product isnt an active noise cancelling headphones, with the right sized buds that fits around your ear, it creates a good barrier for outside noise. with the added music it's then basically noise cancelling.
(+) Design and fit. Mentioned earlier, the design is very sleek and its small enough to fit comfortably in my ear without any real discomfort. It also comes with a bunch of different sized buds which you can use to find the perfect size for you. I wear these at the gym and no matter what I do they dont fall out (unless my hand brushes right against them or something)
(+) Battery Life. Ive never had these headphones die on me and I use them very frequently everyday. I never checked the actual hours of battery life, but i usually charge the case to full completion once a week and its usually enough to recharge the headphones as many times needed for that week.
(+) Connectivity. You pair and connect one earbud (R) and then the other (L) usually connects automatically. Connecting/pairing is usually always fast and without any problems. There's a con to this, see below.
(+) Sturdy. I've dropped these individually, and in the case, multiple times on varying surfaces and everything is still intact and working.
(+) Water resistant. It says it's water proof but ive never actually showered or went for a swim with them. I have dropped them in water, and they are fine. I've also had them on when i was at the gym sweating and they're also fine from that.

(-) slightly bulky. The case is more of an oval and just a tad bit bulky so itll have your pockets looking stuffed. It does come with a lanyard string you can use, but I've used a keychain and clip (similar to how the AirPods cases are) and i just carry it around on my keys without a problem.
(-) gets a little discolored. I got the white case and ive noticed its just SLIGHTLY discolored. But this should be a general understanding if youre getting anything white.
(-) Cant really just listen to one earbud. Although this is possible, if you only connect one side (and keep the other in the case) the one that's connected will beep ever so often as if its waiting for you to connect the other side. If you really want to listen to just one you can connect both, and just put the side you dont want to listen to in your pocket or something (just not back in the case)
(-) The mic range isnt that great. The mic is on the R side (i believe) and when theyre in your ears people on the phone cant really hear you talking (unless you start yelling).  I dont make a lot of calls so this doesnt affect me much. A work around for this is to keep the left side in as a speaker and take the ride side out of your ear and hold it near your mouth while you talk.
(-) Potential to get lost easily. This goes without saying much.
(-) Connectivity. It doesnt auto connect when powered on. This is fine for me because i tend to switch between multiple devices all day. It'll stay paired and linked to your devices, but when you power on you have to open the device's bluetooth setting every time and make sure it connects

You truly get what you pay for!!

All of which are super important if your trying to use these for gym purposes! Not to mention it’s a physical button!! Causing you to further ram the bud in your ear to execute the few commands it does have! The sound quality is “ok” not bad. Not the best or as hyped as a lot of the reviews indicate but I maybe spoiled because I’m used to my Powerbeats 3’s!!!

"Great for listening to music, NOT for making calls.","These are great to listen to music anywhere! They do work well when sweating and showering as you can still keep the beats going. However, they do not work well for talking. The other party can barely hear you and you have to talk above normal volume which makes you stand out when around others. No whispering or they simply can't hear you. Even when talking loud, the other person says you sound far away. For 50 bucks they are great for no wires comfort. I am tired of having a dangling cord and having to worry about the 3.5mm jack getting busted if i sit on the phone wrong. Overall, not bad but just know that calls aren't going to be stellar but do work in a pinch of you can talk loud. Noise cancellation is fair and having 4 inserts makes them fairly easy to find a fit for your ears.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I’m satisfied.,"These are great and convenient for work.(Don’t tel my boss.) for the price, this is a better alternative to apple/Bose/Samsung ear buds. The batter lasts about 4-5 hours. I can walk fairly far away from my phone without them cutting out. The wireless charging feature is cool. My truck has a charging pad so I leave the capsule on there while I drive. The ONE and only con is that sound quality does not quite compare to the expensive brands. But on that note, this ain’t an expensive product, and they still sound very good. I would compare the sound quality to the standard apple/Samsung headphones that come with our phones. Would by again for a gift.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth purchasing.,"When I first purchased these headphones they worked great. After the first month of daily use the headphones would not hold a charge. The connection with my cell phone would disconnect regularly. The battery life went from lasting all day to only lasting 2-4 hours. The last straw was the right ear bud completely stopped working.
Make things worse when I purchased these headphones, I also purchased the extended warranty thinking that it would cover any issues. That was a waste. After spending over half an hour with then, I was advised that the extended warranty only kicks in after t the manufactures warranty is expired.
What a circus. Amazon lost my business. Poor customer service, poor products.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Just didn't work for my needs.,"I bought these to replace my wired headphones I was using for working out because the wires were getting to be frustrating. These seemed like they would be perfect for me, they fit snuggly in my ear (once I found the right size rubber fittings - 4 sizes are included) and the sound quality was great for me but lacking for my audiophile boyfriend. I  was excited for my first workout with them but I didn't even make it 10 minutes in before I had to continually begin to adjust them (take them out and put them back in). I lift heavy so sometimes towards the end of a set I make faces, its at this point that it feels like the earbuds start falling out and have to be readjusted. If you're planning on using these for work, play, or a casual workout these will probably work great for you, they just didn't work for my needs.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
50 foot music connection to my Pixel XL Bluetooth,I'm hooked on these earbuds. They motivate me to excercise as they are sweat proof and waterproof which is important in our tropical climate. At sports events I listen to the game streaming while sitting in the stands. Charging case is cool as earbuds automatically turn on when removed from charging case. Bluetooth 5.0 is giving me music connection @ 50 feet from my phone.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for a superb price!,I have purchased bluetooth headphones before and honestly I have not had much success with them and never have been satisfied.  This was my first experience with earbuds and I was intrigued with Tozo's price as well as its features.  I use the device primarily for the gym and during my commute on my bicycle.  I wanted a product that was functional for my needs and didn't break the bank.  The TOZO product lives up to my expectations and beyond!  The sound quality is amazing and the ease of pairing is top notch.  I feel confident in recommending this product to all.  Thank you TOZO!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Purdy good,"These are great Bluetooth earbuds. The water resistant feature is great... I was even able to talk on the phone in the shower and was told the sound quality was better than the Bluetooth  Set up in my truck. My only issue is that the size of the actual  Electronic component is still a bit large so when I am on a long sweaty run no matter how well the silicone interchangeable buds fit, the weight and the force from repetitive striding eventually causes the buds to slip out of my ears.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love these,I love these sooooo much. The sound quality is surprisingly good. The case charges the buds quickly and they hold a charge for a decent length of time. I love that  the case has a loop for a strap. I have a strap on mine along with charms and such. It's a little thing but it adds more functionality.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for what they are,"Good sound quality, plenty of bass. Headphones will sound better of course, and home stereo speakers will sound light years better than headphones. So for what they are and the price, they sound great.

They have pretty good range too. I was in a closed room about 20 ft. away without losing connection.

The only downside I would say is I wish the battery lasted a lot longer, at least 6 hours. They last about 2-2.5 hours at full volume.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

High end quality w/o $200+ price,"Wow I am impressed with this pair. I mainly bought to use when watering my garden around property. Fit great in ears. Sound quality is boss. My previous earphones had wire that would get tangled or pull out of ears. These have no wire so they never fell out while I moved or yanked heavy water hose around gardens. Noise cancellation is great when neighbor is mowing lawn. Worth my money and I'm happy I did not have to buy expensive other brands. Charging case is conveniently small and compact does not take up space even in my small purse. Bluetooth and pairing was easy with cell, car, mp3 player. I can wear it comfortably even with my tragus hoops on.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Too small always falling out,These do NOT fit everyone. They are huge and don’t fit in my ears at all. They dangle until they inevitably fall out. Forget about being to exercise with these. I’ve just spent half of my lunch chasing them as they fall out every time I chew. They don’t cancel out in noise because they aren’t even in my ear. I try to jam them in but they pop right out. Terrible!,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Earbuds.,"Great sound. Noise cancellation is also very good. Fits perfectly in my ear. My wife had a different brand earbud. She liked this earbud so much, she took this one and gave me hers.

Bigger but a lot better...,"I had the t8 version before the 10. These took the t8 quality and made them much better. The sound, the comfort. They added the magnetic features which is nice and the case seems a lot more sturdy.

Can't get any more convenient,"Five stars purely for the convenience. Extremely easy to use. Pull them out if the box and they instantly start trying to pair.

Sound quality is surprising. Still great even if it's noisy around you, though it may not suppress all surrounding noise. I listen mostly to podcasts and talk on the phone. Everyone has said they're impressed with how I sound.

I have one large insert in my left ear and one extra large insert in my right and they fit great for my ears.

Fits Like Glove!!,"I've finally found ear pods that actually fit my ears!!! I've searched high and low for years trying to find ear pods that won't fall out of my ear while I'm walking but now I've found TOZO!! They came in a timely fashion and it came in attractive packaging. As soon as I opened the packing I was surprised at how nice the ear pods looked but what really got me was the sound quality! These little ear pods have very nice bass to them and the quality of sound allows you to hear little nuances in your music, that you ordinarily would not hear. Pairing your ear pods to my phone was effortless. You just have to make sure that you connect the (right earpod) first, which is the dominant ear pod and the left ear pod will automatically connect once the (right earpod) connects. Another nice feature is the charging case. Once you've paired your earpods and taken them out of the case, the earpods will automatically connect to your phone. When talking on the phone, the person could hear me clearly, which is another feature I look for in earpods. I have not had the earpods long enough to comment on how long the battery life is but if its anything like the other positive features of these earpods I'm sure I won't be disappointed. THANK YOU TOZO!! GREAT PRODUCT for a reasonable price!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very nice headphones,"I initially bought one for my dad and got myself a different one from a different company and the quality was so noticeable.  The sound was much clearer and more crisp on the T10's so I returned the ones I had and bought the T10s again. The comfort, the case, the sound quality is all fantastic.  Also the little features such as the waterproof ability and wireless charging case that you didn't think you need but now that you have it it is amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great quality for the price, I use these everywhere I go","Right out of the box, this product oozes quality. Everything is packaged very nicely. It comes with many different sizes of earbud covers, so I was able to find one that fit my ears perfectly. I can vigorously shake my head around and the earbuds stay on snugly. The sound quality is very good for earbuds, and it is very good at cancelling sound. In crouded hallways with lots of talking, I could barely hear any talking, and the audio was really clear. The case is very convenient, as whenever you take out the earbuds, they automatically turn on, pair to each other, and pair to your device. I would be listening to my music in less than 10 seconds after taking them out of the case, not even having to look at my phone. The battery life wasn't a problem for me, I haven't had to worry about it yet. For this relatively low price, I 100% recommend these earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Music to my ears!!,"Finally earbuds with the sound quality worth bragging about. This was my fourth set and was losing hope in finding a decent set of earbuds but persistence prevailed. Absolutely the best sounding earbuds at this price point.  I will also point out that once you put these in your ears, which TOZO actually gives you directions for proper listening pleasure, you are totally immersed in music.  I only use these in the gym and I can actually say I can’t hear anybody else around me and can’t hear that crappy music they play over their sound system!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
fantastic customer service.,"Update 3:

Customer service was able to show me how to connect a single device. I'm not sure why I couldn't figure that out. I'm still not entirely sure what the beeping means but I can get the right channel into a state where it beeps every 10-15 seconds indefinitely. Not complaints about the product.

Update 2:

After I had some issues I emailed TOZO. They responded immediately and offered to send me a second pair, no questions asked. They told me not to bother to return them. They also said the problem was rare. The next morning I got an email asking if I would like a free wireless charger. Definitely good people.

You can put them in your ear and they make noise but that's about it. You can't skip or pause tracks from either unit and if you want to use the right one only it will beep at you to remind you the left one is not connected. I would find another option.

Low-end/Bass heavy earbuds with quality build and overall sound,"The TOZO T10 earbuds deliver strong low-end and high volume capabilities. The mids and highs also sound good, but can sometimes be slightly overpowered by the heavy bass in particularly bass-heavy songs; however the headphones' loudness helps compensates for this. The build quality/case seems sturdy and can also support wireless charging. Compared to Pasaonomi PX7 earbuds, these are louder (by ~130%), provide much stronger/heavy-hitting bass, have a better/wireless chargeable case, and also fit better on those that don't have small ears.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My new favorite earbuds,"I purchased these because, yet again, I left my wired earbuds w/ wireless dongle at home. I have a one mile walk from the parking lot for a part of my job that I get to do once a month and so I finally had enough of leaving my earbuds at home.  I immediately hopped on Amazon and was planning on ordering a cheap set of wired Bluetooth earbuds to keep in my vehicle but saw these instead.  I decided on these because as a pool owner, I figured if I accidentally dropped them in the pool,w/ the ipx8 rating, they should be fine.  I received them in 2 days w/prime and read the pairing directions 3 times (I've had issues with pairing other items in the past) it turns out I could have  read the directions once and would have still paired them right as they connected quickly and easily.  After picking the right size earbuds, they come w/ 4, I tried them on and couldn't believe how great the sound was.  I couldn't hear my husband snoring at all.  The bass was deep but not over powering.  These really allow you to immerse yourself in the music.  So thrilled I decided on these.  They've become my go to set.  Extra bonus, they include a 1 year warranty with registration.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The BEST QUALITY-PRICE-VALUE for wireless headphones out there!!!!!,"I misplaced my Samsung wireless earbuds and went on Amazon looking for a replacement.  Usually, I don't believe the ratings or hype, but I decided to give these a try because I really can't live without wireless earbuds.  This is a real rating so listen carefully....THESE EARBUDS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST PERIOD!!!  I paired these up with my Samsung phone in seconds, without reading even the quick start guide.  I did glance at the packaging and I noticed that they said WATERPROOF.  Again, I didn't believe it because for sub $50 you don't usually get everything as advertised.  Seeing that Sony, Bose (who I love) and Samsung are selling the same type earbuds with less advertised features for hundreds of dollars more.

Well, I decided to wear these in the shower - since I purchased the Amazon extended warranty I figured if anything goes wrong I am covered.  Well I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  They performed flawlessly - hence my long review!!

I am totally satisfied with my purchase and you will be too.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE EARBUDS!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome wire free headphones,"I was seeking wire free headphones that were not AirPods (apple headphones tend to not stay in my ears). After doing a bit of comparing on Amazon with a few different brands, these looked like the clear winner.

Connection to my phone was simple and not spotty as I walk through the city. I will note that you don't have volume control on these headphones, or the capability to change your song, but this wasn't an issue for me as I have an apple watch and can adjust these things from there. Call quality is good - asked the person on the other end of the phone if they had any trouble hearing me and they didn't.

So far I've done various workouts in these and haven't had issues with them falling out of my ear. I've ran on the treadmill and did a HIIT workout (one that involved a lot of jumping) and had no issues.

I carry around 2 pairs of this earbud, and one charging case. When battery gets low, I swap the two pairs -- use the fully charged earbud, and place the low-battery earbud in the charging case. Switching bluetooth connections is very smooth (tested on my Pixel XL).

- For listening to music, the sound quality & bluetooth connections are solid.
- For calling, the mic is too quiet. The other person on the line has trouble hearing me, unless I hold the right earbud next to my mouth.
- Battery life lasts about 2 hours. Since I carry around two pairs of earbuds + one charging case, and swap the earbuds when one of them is low on battery, the battery lasts me all day.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Decent choice for waterproof and durable earbuds,"I got my T10 earbuds and used them for about a month now, and I am decently satisfied with them. I was looking for wireless, comfortable earbuds that I can use in the shower with an average price - here's my experience with the T10 earbuds so far:

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN PACKAGING
The T10 earbuds came packaged with the following items:
- Left and Right earbuds
- 4 pairs of earbud covers (XL, L, Med, Small)
- Black strap string (I haven't figured out how to tie this to the dock yet)
- Charging dock
- Short micro-usb cable (in case you don't have a wireless charger)
- Manual
- Small note to register my purchase with the TOZO store to claim additional warranty time

SIZE
The earbuds are fairly small in packaging. The dock itself easily fits in the palm of my hand, and the earbuds snap into the dock when placed for charging.

COMFORT
I recently developed a greater sensitivity to earbuds, where if the cover is too big and presses against the sides of my inner ear, it becomes uncomfortable until I'm feeling a consistent headache. Because of this, I'm very picky with the earbuds I choose. For references, I regularly use the JVC HAFR6B Gumy Plus earbuds with the smallest size earpieces, and those work perfectly for me. In comparison, the smallest size earpieces for the T10 earbuds are a snug fit and caused slight discomfort in my ears initially, but my ears adjusted to them over the month.
The larger size earpieces for the T10 earbuds certainly do a better job keeping the earbuds in your ears, but to do so they squeeze against your inner ear to create a tight fit.

For showering, I think they definitely get the job done. I've had multiple experiences where one or both earbuds would fall out while showering, but they seem very durable and were not damaged when they slipped out and fell onto the bathtub floor. I also feel significantly less discomfort in my ears while I shower, so the T10s are more or less exactly what I needed.

CONNECTIVITY
For showering, the T10s offer relatively stable connectivity even while covered in water. I noticed that connections with devices 1 room away does result in consistent stutters, so it's helpful to keep whatever paired device you're using close to you while you wash.

CONS
Changing the earpieces on the T10s can be tedious and difficult, because the earpieces are very tight fits. When changing earpiece covers, don't be afraid of pressing down firmly to get them on.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I will hopefully update this review in 5 months to check on durability.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not for runners,"I use the buds for running... extremely short range, maybe a couple of feet. I run with a running belt where I carry my phone. It’s a little aggravating when the music cuts out.  It also occurs when I turn my head.
I have started using these only for walks and working around the house. I have not noticed any appreciable difference in noise cancellation. I’m not certain the product has this capability.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless Earbuds with bluetooth,"I wanted to give the product 5 stars because there is so many positive things. The one drawback is the slave earbud (left side) occasionally has signal loss when I am riding bike with phone in pocket. It didn't matter which pocket (left or right front). Aside from that instance, walking around, working on computer, and streaming online audio - the pair of earbuds work great. I love the different sizes of ear bud options. and the construction and feel of material is excellent.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Skeptical buyer amazed,"I was always skeptical about buying these Bluetooth headphones because of the ease of losing them. You just have to be careful and mindful of what you do with them. I've had these earbuds for over 90 days now and I do not have any issues.

I had read online that most earbuds are high treble and that wouldn't suit my tastes. But these definitely have bass boosted nicely, without making conversation unclear.

I think I've probably had these earbuds fall out of my ears a handful of times but that was before I actually put the buds in the recommended way.

I workout in these faithfully and only twice have I had to keep one from falling out during cardio.

The battery life isn't long like my Bluetooth over the ear headphones but I also don't have 3 hour long sessions so the battery life is fine. Plus if they start to die, a 5 minute recharge will give you like 30 mins . The recharge time is pretty damn quick too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love them so much I bought 2,These are my 4th pair of Bluetooth headphones and every other brand before these were losing connection they wouldn’t pair right away. Sound was choppy but these work great I have one pair at home and a pair at work!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FINALLY earbuds that fit AND sound fantastic!,"I have THE hardest time finding earbuds that stay in my left ear. I have other wireless earbuds with the clip over the ear, and Apple EarPods with a wire, that do NOT stay in my ears for anything. These actually stay in!  And the sound quality is awesome, especially the bass. It literally booms in my ear and sounds great. I got them in white since my daughter has black ones. The white is very sleek-looking!  I am loving these earbuds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Makes Life SO Much Easier!,"I needed wireless earbuds because I do a lot of driving for work but need to answer calls throughout. Unfortunately, my car is rather simple and doesn't have a bluetooth system. I bought an FM transmitter in hopes it would take care of all the problems, but that didn't go well, and I returned it. When these earbuds came in, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to connect them to my phone and then to set up the charging units. So far, they've been wonderful! Music comes in strong, the pushing of buttons is simple, and they don't fall out even when I'm shaking my head intensely for... no reason.

I only have two areas of concern: 1) even with Spotify tracks, there's a bit of fuzziness in the background, and 2) using the smallest earbud covers, the earbuds end up being a tiiiiiny bit too big for my ears (but then again, maybe I'm the only person in the world with this problem, sigh).

Random note: I will be switching over to an iPhone in a few days, and I'm really hoping these work well with it!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Changing my original review to ""Great perfomer, fabulous customer service""","I rated TOZO Wireless Earbuds originally with one start and returned purchase because of quiality issues.
Couple of days ago TOZO Customer service contacted me and replaced original purchase with brand new updated version. This like day and night. For less than $50 those headphones sounds more than awesome. Rich bass and outstanstanding full range sound. Of course as with any BT Earbuds even twice more expensive expect sometimes connectivity issues when you make sharp head turn and you streaming device (phone) located in your pants. Charging is fast. Phone quality is in pair with Samsung BT earbuds and Apple AirPods. So I'm changing my rating from 1 start to 5 start because of quality, value and excellent caring customer service.

Lowest quality earbuds. TOZO didn't even include ear cups except ones attached to the ear buds. Forget about bass, only midrange. Left one constantly disconects. Call quality is unexceptable. Returning",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The last earbuds I will ever buy!!!Very satisfied!!,First of all the customer service is AMAZING!!They went above and beyond to resolve an issue!!These have been the best earbuds!The sound is very good quality and I love how convenient the charging box is!I also love that they have held up for almost a year now!!We haven't bought another set of earbuds since we purchased these!!Definitely recommend!!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for the price!,"I haven’t had these long, but I am impressed so far. Sound is clear, for us great, and the induction wireless charger aspect to them is really neat. Paired easily, and actually came with a manual.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Way better than expected. Highly recommend.,"These earbuds are awesome! Great sound, full bass, and importantly, they stay snug in my strangely shaped ear holes where other earbuds normally don’t. I normally have to send other Ill-fitting earbuds back.

 I haven’t tried running in them but they are good for weight lifting.  Noise canceling is just passive.  Not sure about the claim (at least in the instructions) about being able to use them when swimming.  Bluetooth and WiFi don’t transmit through water and as soon as there is any water between your eardrum and ear phone, the sound is absolutely muted.  Good distance for reception, they have held the signal up to 40 ft away.

Highly recommended, especially at this price point.  Definitely keepers!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great upon initial use, but reviews are fake","Good so far, but reviews are skewed. The company emails you after purchase and offers a free wireless charger in exchange for a 5 star review which they do not actually give you.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great ear buds at a great price,"Good purchase experience and great ear buds.  The sound quality is good and they fit great and are comfortable during my fairly active workouts.  The only thing that's a little disappointing is that I have to charge the case more often than I expected, maybe every 3 days.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Comfortable wear, easy bluetooth pairing","These are the most comfortable bluetooth earbuds I've had yet. They also pair easily with my phone, so no issues getting them to work (which is not always the case with other brands...). On the other hand they seem to be very sensitive to touch - if I just move them slightly while music is playing I sometimes lose it for a second, or hear this uncomfortable noise (but goes right back to normal afterwards). Also, when they say deep bass they mean it - a little TOO strong for me but if you like that you're good. Overall happy with these!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better sound quality and fit than any other earbud or headset I’ve EVER owned!!!,"I have purchased several wireless earbuds and headsets but NONE compare to the excellent fit, sound quality and noise isolation that these little gems have!!! From the moment I took them out of their charging case, I was impressed.  They paired with my phone and tablet device almost instantly!!  The enhanced bass, ease of use, paring and ability to listen to music or answer calls without picking up my phone, make these earbuds far more superior, than those well-advertised brands that I’ve spent $150+ for in the past.  The TOZO T10 5.0 Wireless Earbuds are an EXCELLENT buy and not only do I highly recommend, I would purchase them again in a heartbeat!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great purchase so far! Would definitely recommend.,I really like these earbuds. They sound great and I love the bass which was the one thing I was really concerned about. The battery life is good and they really do cancel out outside noise. I have to turn them off or take them out to hear what people are saying lol. And I love that they are waterproof. I have not had any problems so far and would definitely recommend these earbuds!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"For $50, Buy Something Better!","I’ve had these earbuds for about three weeks now, and I must say, for what I paid for them, they are terrible! The “sound quality” that’s so highly bragged about, just isn’t there for me. I’ve tried every combination of earbud covers they come with, and they still sound like $5 dollar store earbuds, with  a very tinny, weak tone. I’ve changed my equalizer on my iPhone a dozen, or more times and still can’t fix it. Just a small nitpick on them, and I would have said this even if I had liked them, they look absolutely stupid in your ears! Not low profile, whatsoever. If you lie down with them in your ears, you will have trouble laying on your side, as they protrude around half an inch out of your ears. Now for the real reason for the negative review; THE BATTERY LIFE! The battery life on these earbuds is god-awful! They claim 4 hours on a full charge (if I remember correctly, I didn’t check the listing before writing this) and when you unbox them, the features list on the box claims “a 3 hour battery life”. (Again, I did not check before writing this, however actual product claims hour less than listing here) Instant lie right there, folks. I have seen a MAXIMUM 2 hour life with mine on a full charge and that’s on volume click 4... Not impressive at all. And the “fast charging” feature, is not that quick. 45 minutes to get a full charge. For example, my old $12 Walmart earphones had a max life of 6 hours on a 90 minute charge! What. The. Heck. Problem is, they are very fragile pieces of junk, that crap out from on drop of water. That’s why these aren’t only one star. The water-resistance is really good, so far, and the 4 charge case is really nice, as well.

Bottom line; is if you asked me how much I’d say these are worth, let me use them for two days,then said name the price, I’d tell you $20. Fifty dollars for these is absolutely ridiculous. They are nice, in a couple of ways, but definitely not worth fifty bucks. There’s plenty of WAY better options on here, for that price.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Redeeming warranty after 6 weeks,"The sound is better than most earbuds. It’s loud and has bass. I love that I can’t hear people talking when I am wearing both. I have not tested the waterproof feature. They come with differences sizes for large or small ears. I have to use the smallest ones and still they regularly fall out of my ears. So often my left earbud stopped working. It’s completely unresponsive. It turns on rarely but never connects and always stops working again. After 6 weeks, I am redeeming my replacement. I am willing to get more because I do love these earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They don't stay in your ears.,"It's a good thing these were water resistant. They have fallen out of my ears into urinals, salads, weight room floors and puddles. Even after buying the foam mold tips they still don't stay in and I shove them in there pretty good. Waste of money.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Garbage! Avoid this product!,This product stopped working soon after I received it. I couldn't even return or get a refund.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well rounded performance,I've had this for about 2 months now and I have yet to encounter an issue with it. I've used it for almost 3 hours of continuous use without recharging. The case is handy and the overall performance of the headphones themselves is satisfactory. They are easy to pair but the only complaint I have is that you cannot control volume or skip songs using the buttons according to the manual at least. Other than that it was worth the money.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect budget headsets!,"I can't really say much because the left ear bud doesn't work.
EDIT:I contacted Tozo and all I can say is that their customer service is great! They sent me a pair and they work PERFECT. I have not tested battery life, but they are truly waterproof so you can wear them while taking a shower no problem",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Weak connection between left and right device,"The sound quality would be okay IF the left bid did not continually lose signal and quit emitting sound. I am contemplating returning these as I’m disappointed with the connection strength.
Update: TOZO did offer me a new pair of ear buds after my negative review. They told me not to return the old ones which was nice. Then they asked me to update my review even before the replacements arrived due to their goodwill gesture. I told them via email that my review was not for service but rather product quality. Unfortunately the new ear buds have the same issue. I fear that the Amazon reviews have been skewed to show good quality when many people have issues but receive additional product in return for them to improve their review.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Solid Set of Bluetooth Headphones,"My office requires bluetooth headsets in a room that is ESD sensitive so I decided to pick these up. I also have a set of $60 wired headphones I planned on using everywhere except for the ESD room but these have quickly become my new favorite pair of headphones. They dont come loose during workouts, they are fully functional in the shower and the range on the bluetooth is pretty unbelieveable. The set comes  with 4 sets of earbuds of varying sizes. I have found that the second smallest set provides a comfortable fit and minimizes external noise. Very satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Range leaves a thing to be desired,"Sound quality is surprisingly good for a $50 pair of independent wireless earbuds. Bass is really good. Full range frequency response is great. Highs tend to be drowned out by the lows although they do seem to have a ""break in"" period. Bluetooth range is terrible though. It cuts out with my phone just in my pants pocket similar to early bluetooth headsets from 10 years ago which makes me wonder if it's actually bluetooth 5.0. Both sides are in perfect sync though",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
One Earbud lasts about an hour.,I used these earbuds for listening to music at work (8 hours alternating earbuds) and working out at the gym(both earbuds). I have been using these headphones for about 4 months now and the right earbud only lasts about 1 hour and often it randomly connects while it is charging. Overall the earbuds work great just that the battery on the one diminished rather fast compared to normal Bluetooth headphones.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect quality . Could be a bit smaller,The quality is very good compared to the Apple air pod my old complaint is that it is very large. I thought it would be smaller and less noticeable that’s why I got the close to skin color khaki instead of white or black . I would recommend this over the Apple air pod considering it is less than a third of the price and you get the same quality I hope in the near future they make a less bulky version then it would be perfect,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
definitely a good buy,"First wireless earbud ever owned - after comparison shopping and some research, i chose these and i have to say i am glad i did. Great sound - good bass and crisp treble. Some issues connecting and pairing first time but could be because didn't read instructions. Reset the buds and they paired and connected with my Android without a hitch. No issues with connectivity on subsequent usages. Pausing the earbuds with the button does not stop the audio play - just mutes it. Have to pause in the app you are listening to if you need to stop playback temporarily. As for fit, these buds are lightweight and one of the 4 sizes of rubber grommets included should keep them in place. I have to push these bud back in now and then but over all they have stayed in place with jogging for 30 min. Recommended purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Nice earbuds, but bad sound quality","I got these with high expectations, due to all the good reviews, but these earbuds do not live up to it. First off, they are very bulky compared to others and stick out of your ear a lot. Second of all, the when playing music, it is very pitchy and hot on the higher frequency which hurts my ear. The noise cancellation is impressive, but still not happy with it. Do not recommend for people with any care for sound quality.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cool but battery life could be alot better.,"Overall these headphones are sick!!! Great sound. Had em for a little over a month. Couple of cons. They tend to fall out when excersizing and the battery life is maybe 3 hours tops. Overall, a solid 4 out of 5.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best sound at this price point!,The sound is the best I've heard in any headset at this price point. Or maybe even the $100 price point as well. They are incredibly stable in your ears and I love the wireless charging since I can power share from my phone. My only draw back is that I use my headphones all day at work and these dont last the full day without re-docking part way through. Thankfully the case holds a charge as well and the earbuds are juiced up and ready to rock in what seems to be 20 mins or less. All in all I'm very happy with this product!,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Disappointed, wouldn't recommend","This product only works within 10-15 feet of your device. I can't even clean my house with these in with my phone in one room without the sound totally cutting out. I contacted Amazon and they told me the max range is 15 feet.
I wish I knew that before I bought them as that isn't in the product information and to me it's just as bad as corded earbuds.
The sound is good but I can barely use these!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No good,I’m giving a 2 stars because the sound is good when it stays in my ears. I tried the 3 sizes and None worked. They keep jumping out from my ears. The noise canceling maybe because it keeps jumping is not good at all. Plus have to charge 2/2 days and I just listen no more than 1 hour music per day. Had a better quality and cheaper one but unfortunately I lost it,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great purchase,"I did not expect much from these wireless earbuds when I first bought them, but I figured that since they were on sale and I needed earbuds I would give them a try. I did not realize how great they were until I received them. They work really well whether you are in the shower or running in the rain, and the only connection issues I had was when I left my phone in my bag. Would highly recommend to anyone in the market to buy wireless earbuds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left side audio breaks up,"These separate earbuds are setup such that the Left Earbud is connected (wirelessly) to the Right Earbud (not the device).  When the earbuds are too far apart, the Left Earbud cuts out.  No problem, right?  You just put them in your ears and that's the only distance to worry about.  Well, it's a problem if the Left Earbud cuts out when they're in your ears.  I proved this by removing the Right Earbud and holding it mid-way across my face.  When I do that, the Left Earbud cuts out.  I'm able to reproduce this by either putting the Right Earbud in my ear, or simply in an outstretched arm.

I've been accused both figuratively and literally of having a big head, but it's silly that the wireless connectivity between the Right Earbud and my phone (in my left pants pocket) is fine, but the connectivity between my ears ... err... between the earbuds in my head is so very, very poor.

Easily the worst money I've spent on headphones, ever.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid Set of TWB Earphones,"I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this ""review"" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.

The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.

As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.

As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).

Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.

In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"The reviews are right, these are awesome!","Usually ear buds fall out of my ears and I have to hunt down replacement rubber ends for them. The Tozo buds came with multiple options. They’re comfortable and easy to operate. The first time I tried my favorite playlist, I was absolutely amazed. It was like being in my own sound bubble. The bass and sound quality are great. My friend was talking to me with both buds in, I didn’t hear a thing. No pain as of yet from extended wear. Great product! Also, I’m so happy that these didn’t break the bank like most wireless headphone/earbud options",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Defective Left Earbud (2nd update),"Sound kept dropping out in the left earbud.  Not sure whether it was a bad Bluetooth connection or a short in the earbud. Battery life was right at the 3 hour life as advertised. I am sure this would have gotten worse over time.  I returned the product after using two times.

07/24/19 update: Vendor contacted me and offered to send me a new set of earbuds free of charge to test and review. I am revising my original one star rating to three stars for good customer service. Hopefully the new earbuds will deserve a much higher rating.

08/04/2019 update: I received the new earbuds on Tuesday, July 30th. After fully charging them and pairing them to my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, I used them on my exercise walk the following morning. Unfortunately, within less than a minute of starting my walk, the left earbud started losing the signal and continued to do so for the next five minutes of me trying to get them to work. After 5 minutes, I gave up and turned them off and put them in my pocket. For those that are wondering, I wear my phone in an armband on my left arm, so distance to the phone is certainly not the issue. Just to be sure that the problem was not related to my phone, I paired the earbuds to my wife's IPod and tried again to walk with them while listening to music. The problem continued to happen with the iPod, so I know the earbuds are defective. Because of this, I am reducing my product rating back to one star. I appreciate the company trying to make me happy, but I am unable to endorse their product.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty impressed for the price,"I've owned Jaybird X2s for a while and while those headphones were nice, they were always a pain to charge and keep track of. These TOZO T10s are sleek and comfortable and offer an impressive sound quality for their price. Even without ear grips, these headphones have no issue staying in my ears and with extended wear, I don't feel any irritation. Definitely recommended.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sound and battery life,"Connect very easy. Awesome sound. Sound quality better than Air pods.  Stay in place while working out, running, and doing yard work",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I am surprised!,"First off these have so much bass!!! These sound like Beats or even Sony headphones! They are better than AirPods in my Opinion because they have more bass than AirPods. The case is really small and really portable. You can put these in your pocket easily. I love how portable these are! The battery life is very good. They are very noise insulating, which is good for keeping out noise. They come with extra ear tips if you lose some. They fit pretty well and don’t fall out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds!,Outstanding earbuds!  I do a lot of outside work with loud equipment and I couldn’t be happier with the sound and noise cancellation feature. Battery life is at least 5 hours.

Premiere Personal Listening Product at a Premium Price,"The Tozo T10 Earbuds turned out to be just as advertised and are high-quality, comfortable and very durable. I read the reviews prior to my purchase and was pleasantly surprised that the hype about these inexpensive earbuds was spot-on. I rarely give a 5-star review, but I don't think you could get a better earbud for the price. The earbuds come with multiple sizes of earbud covers that will ensure comfort to most users (unless someone has extremely tiny or oversized ear canals.

Price VS Quality is amazing!,"You might be thinking that since these are cheaper than those AirPods or whatever they're called, that these are no good; but, you would be wrong! These earbuds are amazing, as I've put them to the test in a real workout many times already. Great sound, great battery life, really everything is just as advertised. Get you a pair — you'll be glad you did!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Ability to use buds independently is a real plus,"Decided to try these out. As other reviewers have noted - the ability to independently use the buds or together is a real plus for me. If I am listening to an audio book (or listening to something where it is not a necessity to have both buds in), I can be using one bud while the other is charging, and then switch when the other one needs to be charged - is a great feature as this gives an almost indefinite listening time.

Unbelievable sound quality,Amazing headphones worked right out of the box. Full rich sound with deep bass.

Can’t wait to try these running. You won’t be disappointed! Great package too.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing quality for the price you pay!!,These are perfect to use for physical activities or at the gym. They don’t fall out which is a huge plus and the bass is better than expected.

The magnetic function in the case helps to be it secured even when it’s open.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great bass quality, sound, and easy to use","I actually purchased bluetooth earbuds from a different company of a similar price along with these to compare and contrast between the two and see which one I preferred better and these earphones really took the cake for better sound. The bass and overall sound quality was noticeably front and center and more apparent than the other brand I tried (taotronics), which sounded more distorted. I have other products from taotronics and was hoping their earbuds would be good too but compared to tozo's earbuds at least I must say these were much better by a landslide. I've used mine every day since I got them and had no problem figuring out how to connect them so the ease of use is great for when I'm gymming or when listening to music at home and want to dive into bed and chillax. I appreciate that these earphones also seem to have noise cancellation although it may not be advertised? The only issue is that it blocks out too much sound that it's dangerous when I'm on the stairmaster and don't realize how loud I'm panting because I can't hear anything else besides my music! Anyway I was blown away by the sound quality over anything else compared to standard quality of other brands I've tried, and that'll be the main reason I'm choosing these over others of similar price (and airpods are too expensive lol).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing earbuds!,The moment I took them out of the box I loved them! They look sleek and well made. The charging box is well made as well. The magnets that keep the box shut are very strong and I don’t worry about it accidentally opening and the buds falling out. I like the fact that the buds link automatically  once I take them off the charger. When I connected them to my phone for the first time and listened to them I was very satisfied. They are as loud as I like and they definitely are noise canceling. I can’t hear anything when I have them in and that’s how I like it.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbuds!!!,"I purchased the T10 earbuds and they worked great, did everything mentioned. I understand that some products malfunction so Unfortunately one earbud stopped working.

Comfortable and Secure,"These ear buds stay in very well. Battery life is as advertised. Recharging is quick and easy in carrying case. I’ve experienced quite a bit of cut out lately from one bud to the other. Not sure if it’s a pairing issue or charging issue. Will continue to monitor.

EXCELLENT,I loved these headphones. They are comfortable and don't fall out like some wireless headphones. The battery life lasts for hours and they are a lot less expensive than airpods.

"Good price, good battery and fair sound.",Is a good product for the price. My only insatisfacción is that on the calls not always sound is strong. Sometimes the other person do not hear and you are force to remove it. If you are in a not noise environment works perfect but if not probably the noise cancelation reduce the power of the sound. But if you have both connected is very good sound even though not that strong as expected.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Easy to Pair and Use Right Out of the Box,"This was my first experience with Bluetooth earbuds, and found them to be very easy to pair with each other and with my iPhone XR, my iPad, and Amazon 4K FireTV Stick right out of the package.  I have just begun using, but so far am impressed with the sound and build quality.  These appear to be a very solid value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than my Bose ever were.,"UPDATE: I have now purchased two sets of these.  The sound and feel and ease are more than I ever hoped for.  I wear them almost every minute I'm at work.  I wear them so much that three other co workers have also now purchased them because they liked them so much more than their airpods and bulky over the ear headphones.  I can't rave enough about these.  Probably the best purchase ever on Amazon.

I was ridiculously skeptical about these headphones when I ordered them. $50? I have $150 wired Bose in ear headphones that are starting to wear out. The wire was so annoying when trying to work at my desk and block out noise of my office. I had to get wireless.

All that said, these are BETTER than my Bose headphones ever were.  The weight of them is a little odd feeling at first but easy enough to get used to. Pairing to my phone literally took 15 seconds. I may buy another pair just to keep in my back pack so I have them when I travel.  Amazing find.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love these headphones,"I can't stop recommending them to others. I'm a guy who loves listening to podcasts and music as I go about my day, taking walks, running, taking a shower, etc. And these headphones are the best product for that. The charging case is amazing for keeping the headphones together and for keeping them charged. I have small kids, so the fact that the earbuds are harder to pull off are really good (yet, if they don't fit, you can still get them off and resize them), and the case keeps the headphones protected from my beloved little monsters as well. I kind of wish I could charge one headphone while listening to the other, that might make the product a little better, it would certainly prevent that awkward moment where you have to stop listening to charge your headphones, but that's a small thing.

Great product. I'm a huge fan, and I heartily recommend it not just here, but to everyone I know.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Easy and effective,"These buds are great! They're easy to get started, fit snugly (they offer multiple bud sizes) so I don't hear other stuff when listening, and they sound clean and clear.

Left ear bud continued to cut out,"I purchase these to ware while working out. I used them for three weeks and the left ear bud continuously cuts out or fades in and out. At first I though it was just a glitch between my phone but then it kept getting worse and it also happened when paired with my watch. It was so frustrating trying to work out and listen to music that kept cutting in and out in one ear. I spoke with Amazon and I’m returning them. Thank you Amazon for the great customer support!

Basic Headphones with “Great Reviews”,"Very happy to upgrade from cheaper TaoTronics to these after seeing reviews. The buds came fully charged which was great, but did not come with different ear plug size options. They came with the generic size which I feel is a normal ear size. I do a lot of cardio and they slip out every 3-6 minutes. It’s so annoying. The tutorial video they advise you to watch, suggests you twist the bud in your ear. I can twist it all day and still slips out of my ear. The sound is ok, but very very basic. I would absolutely never buy these again. I wished I would’ve returned these upon arrival. Good luck with your purchase otherwise.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Ear Buds!,The Tozo earbuds are very convenient and provide very good sound quality.

"Worth it - good sound quality, blocks some noise, makes riding the metro pleasant.","Purchasing these headphones were worth it. Pros - wireless, minimal issues pairing, and while they are not noise-cancelling, they are in-ear so they block a lot of the outside noise. Cons - a little bulky of a fit, but that's kind of to be expected. The other thing, while not exactly a con, is that they are quite loud. I keep them on the lowest volume most of the time, otherwise I think they probably would be bad for your ears. Overall, would definitely purchase again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The positive reviews are real!,"I am very satisfied with these bluetooth wireless headphones! I will be honest,  I was a bit skeptical based on the price and features. I just figured something would he inferior to the big name headphones that cost three times as much.
I read some reviews stating one or both of their earbuds would cut out and was hoping that was not the case for mine, I am really happy to say I have had zero issues so far!

I use mine with my ipod nano and once i paired them for the first time they automatically pair now.  I really like that they give voice prompts as to what is going on. So you know when they power off and on and when they are pairing and have paired.
I have many styles of headphones and these are near the top. The only pair that have more punch are my WIRED pair of Sony xtra bass. But you can't compare them as they are wired and wireless is SO much nicer in the gym. These tozo buds beat out the plantronics bluetooth that I'm replacing.  They still use a cord to connect both buds.

These get more than loud enough I usually do not go past 3/4 volume and i listen pretty loud.

I also have not had any issues with them falling out. Just make sure they are in your ears. I use the ear piece that came on the buds but you get a total of four sizes to get the right fit for your ears.

The case is solid too and the buds click right in with a satisfying snap as the magnets meet. The whole case charges wirelessly too and works great on my wireless charger.

I'm glad I went with these and saved about 100.00 over the big named ear buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"TOZO T10 ear buds exceed expectations with sound, noise reduction and fit.","This is the 4th pair of wireless headsets that I have purchased. Very simple to 'install', join up quickly, find other bluetooth devices quickly. So far they are the best, and the noise reduction is very good - better than the noise reduction headset that I use on airplanes, tho these are a bit newer (technology). I picked a banjo + guitar piece on my phone, played it on top volume on the table and could barely hear it while listening to a clarinet and orchestra solo with these buds. Pretty excellent. The various size ear seals makes a tight fit possible. Not sure if I'd run with these on for fear of losing one, but walking and performing simple tasks, leaning over, etc., is no problem at all. Like these a lot. Can't judge battery life, just received the set, only have ~ 2 hours after charging.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Ear buds do not charge while case is charging.,"My rating generally stems from a comparison to another product.  I purchased both these and the ""SoundPEATS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds in-Ear Stereo TWS Bluetooth Headphones Wireless Earphones"" as lightening deals on Amazon.  On one note, these were about 20% cheaper so that has some weight to it, however the fact that the ear buds do not charge while the case is charging is miserable.  Battery-wise these are no comparison.  After 4 workouts these ear buds & case are dead and need a recharge.  The SoundPEATS on the other hand lasted me 3 weeks (15 workouts) on a single-case-charge and unlike the TOZO Earbuds, the earbuds can charge while the case is charging.  On the plus side, the battery does last the length of a workout for me (about an hour) but the fact that they don't make it through a week of workouts is a sticking point.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

This is my review of these earbuds after three months of usage.
Pros:
-Louder than expected.

-It works in the sauna, and the shower
-perfect for workouts

Cons:
-doesn’t work under water

"Sporadic cuts outs, microphone is terrible.","I really wanted these to work well. I particularly liked the wireless charging feature of the case - it is very convenient just to drop it on my charging plate. I have no complaints about sound quality, but I typically listen to audiobooks and not music, so I might not be as demanding as others.

Unfortunately, these earbuds have a few serious flaws.

One killer for me is that the microphone is terrible.  It is extremely quiet.  I left a voicemail as a test call, and when playing it back I had to crank my PC volume to the max to barely hear it. I don't make many calls with earbuds, but I do get them occasionally, and I don't want to have to take an earbud out, fumble in my pocket for the phone and switch the audio device (without dropping the earbud) before I can take the call.

Another problem, and one that would likely bother everybody, is sporadic drop-outs of the right earbud - it goes silent for a moment, and then comes back. The time between dropouts has been as short as every couple minutes, and as long as half an hour.

A final annoyance is when I pull the earbuds out of the case and they pair with the phone, they crank the volume up very high, so my ears get blasted before I can turn it down. I've never had any other bluetooth headset do that.

I'm using Android 9 (Pie) on a Samsung Note 9.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I would buy them again in a heart beat,Hi I don’t work out so I can’t rate them. I have small ear canals so I use the smallest buds they great. The noise canceling is great as my wife snores loudly.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy to start using,"So far so good. Only used a few times but couldn't be easier to charge and connect. Very good sound, plenty of bass. I actually had to turn down the bass on my phone to get to a sound I wanted. Use them to exercise, no problem falling out at this point.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"So far, so good - well worth the price","These headphones have not disappointed.  I've only been using them for a week, but so far I am really impressed.

Big Pros:
User friendly/Easy pairing - connecting to a phone is super easy, simply take the earbuds out of their case and they start looking for a device to pair with.  Simply go into your phone's Bluetooth menu, select TZ10 and done.
Battery Life - The earbuds themselves hold a decent charge, but coupled with the built-in battery in the case means they will last a really long time.
Comfortable fit - I must admit I was worried when I first got these that I would not feel comfortable wearing them.  I was pleasantly surprised in how well they fit in my ears.  They provide several different adapters to ensure you get a comfortable/snug fit.  I also never felt any discomfort with while wearing them for longer periods of time.
Waterproof - come on, that kinda says everything right there.
Customer service/warranty - Maybe not a big thing for some people, but for me this was a big one.  This device comes with a 1 - year warranty.  Getting the warranty activated was very easy, and the agents I talked to were very courteous and helpful.  For me...major plus.

Concern: To be fair, I have to voice my one big concern at this point.  This is likely true for all similar earbuds, but I worry that devices that small are easily lost.  Even the charging case the buds come in is quite compact, but does come with a cord to allow you to secure it to something larger.  I guess in the end it comes down to how diligent you are about with taking care of them.

As I said, I've only been using these buds for a week now.  If I have any additional experiences later I will definitely add them to this review.  But as I say in the title: So far so good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"If you have tiny ear holes, these are not for you.","I'm still on the fence of whether or not I will return these.
Pros:

Sound quality is good, battery life is SUPER long, and they stay in my ear holes when I am jogging. I generally have problems with buds falling out, and was worried when I read the other reviews, but I have had no problems.

Cons:
The beep constantly for the first few minutes after I pair them and it gives me the rage. I have no idea why they do this or how to fix it.
When I run and I put my phone in the pocket of my running tights on the opposite side of my body, my music cuts out more than every second. When I move the phone to the same side as the ear bud or have the phone in my hand, perfect quality. It brought me back to the days of having a skipping walkman and also gives me the rage.
The smallest ear bud size is still too big for my tiny, precious, delicate ear holes. This is probably not a problem for most people, but they start to hurt after a while and I only like to have them in strictly when I'm running. I'll use standard headphones when I'm listening to something on my computer or on an airplane.
They're super easy to lose... I currently only know where my right one is lol... good thing I only need the one. This is my problem, of course... but it would be cool if they beeped or something so you cold find them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice set of Buds,I just started using y TOZOs this week. I like them very much! They stay in my ears when I work out and the sound quality is better than average. Charging is quick and easy.

Overall great earbuds for the cost,"When I first got these they were cutting out. Found online that others fixed it by resetting the earbuds and pairing again. This worked for me. Since then I've had no issues and used them for between 3 - 6 hours per day the last few days. Has good level sound (so many headphones attempt to boost bass these days, usually poorly). Charging the buds in the case works great and charging the case is really convenient if you have a QI charger. I've taken calls on these in my office and they worked great. I like the freedom of still being able to use my hands when I talk. The only negative I have found is that the Bluetooth on these doesn't penetrate through things as well as my over the ear Bluetooth headphones. For example, if I leave my phone in another room of the house it will cut out, but I can walk far away form my phone if there is line of sight. I usually have my phone on me when in use so this isn't much of an issue for me. Be sure to register for these and you get a 1 year warranty.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They work fairly well most of the time,"Had some initial pairing issues, same with the second set, but once I got them paired they've been much better than the first.

HORRIBLE battery life-maybe bad from the mfg.?,"Bought these for runs of about an hour to 1 1/2 hrs..besides screwing around with trying to get these TOZO's  to bluetooth connect with the iphone (and break off with connection to car ) i spent far too much fiddling around in doing so..first right then left then right then start all over shutting them down etc etc :-(  The biggest CON was the battery life. Perhaps they were duds from the manufacturer?  Anyway I think I had ONE run where they ran for almost a full hour and a half after they were on charge all night (4 blue light on charge case) and taken off charge immediately b4 run.  I would no sooner start out and the female voice would repeat 'battery low  needs recharging' OVER and OVER again til it went dead about 5 minutes. Checked the connecting pins they appear okay/intact, 4 blue lights on case always fully lit right before I take them out, I am so disappointed in these that I'm just going back to wire earpieces for running...waste of 50 bucks altogether....If you are an athlete, and going out for distance runs etc forget about these....",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

OK, I have been living with these phones for a while and I am less and less impressed with them.
Same opinion of the sound as above.
They do have a tendency for one or both channels to drop for a fraction of a second.
The quality of the mic for phone calls is not good. I often end up switching to just the phone itself...

Worth the price!,I have bought at least three other wireless earphones and Tozo is the only one that has worked properly and has great sound. I’m not very tech-savvy but I was able to follow the instructions on pairing and getting it to work on my smart watch. The sound is clear and doesn’t have any static at all; the power lasts longer too. The other earphones had horrible sound and didn’t last longer than two hours. I also appreciate that Tozo has three earbud sizes because earphones are usually too big for my ears and never stay in place. I used the smallest earbuds for mine and they always stay in place even when I am running. So worth the price!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The price to performance ratio is incredible,"I skeptical at first of the TOZO T10 due to how low the price was as compared to some other wireless earbuds, but now I feel silly for ever having such a feeling. I don't have any complaints at all. They sound better than nearly all of the earbuds I've ever used and they fit very securely in my ears. In addition to this, they charge very quickly in their case. When you combine these factors with the fact that they aren't nearly as expensive as the alternatives, the decision to buy them is a no-brainer.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound; comfy fit!,"The case is very sturdy and well made. Set up was a breeze.

The fit of the headphones is great! It comes with various size ear-pads so you can pick what suits you most comfortably. These headphones cancel sound well for the listener and also do a good job keeping the sound down for folks around the listener.

When on a call the person using the headphones is audible; however, definitely quieter than when on a device/headphones with a mic closer to your mouth.

Good buy. Good and weird company.,"The product has good sound Quality and relatively good bass for the price point. The charging has never been an issue for me and I have worked  out walked around campus (college) with these on. I will say I was sent a slightly alarming email that seemed like spam with highlighted words, and a lot of pressuring language to give a 5 star review in exchange for a wireless charger. I still would like the charger but I also know that a reputable company would not create false positive reviews in exchange for a free wireless charger so I expect to see mine in the mail regardless of me not giving them a 5 star review. I will update.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better bass than my apple headphones and no cord to tangle,"Pros: These work well and have better sound quality than the corded earbuds I was using. The case charges with a regular microusb cable and the buds make a satisfying click when they snap into it.

The batteries last several hours for sure but definitely will need charging on e.g. a longer trip.

Cons:

You have to remove both from the case in order to use either.

Loud audio feedback in each ear whenever anything connects, disconnects, or is trying to pair.

My iphone doesn't auto-pair with them, I have to click them manually (but it does auto-pair with my bluetooth speaker).

Packs some power in a small sleek setup.,"I can’t do AirPods . Not only do they not fit, but every time I see someone with AirPods I’m reminded of the scene in There’s Something About Mary where he has... well... “stuff “ dripping from his ear.

I bought these based on the reviews and how they look. I’m tired of catching the cable of my headphones when I’m in the gym.

Look, if you’re skeptical, I understand, but don’t be. I just got them and started tinkering around with the ear plugs and charger and it’s a pretty sleek setup. Just make sure to pay attention to the directions in the box.

High Quality Sound,"When I first purchased these ear buds, I was a little skeptical because affordable high quality sound seems to be hard to find.  I was pleasantly surprised!

Great headphones at a great price,"This is a solid pair of headphones! The audio quality is very clear and the bass is deep, but not muddy. My biggest suggestion is to take the time to find the right fit for the earbuds. They give you plenty of options and finding the right size helps keep them comfortable as well as secure.

I'll agree with the 3 hours of battery life while in constant use (I wear these at work) and the case does a good job of giving you about 3 full recharges.

I'm currently having issues with the charging case not holding a charge, but I reached out to their support people and got a very prompt response with directions on how to proceed next to get the replacement case.

My only criticism would be that they will occasionally drop the signal to my phone and then reconnect if my phone is in my left pocket (the headphones connect to your phone through the right earbud). Typically it's a very brief pause in the music, but noticeable. Hardly a reason not to consider these an excellent find, though.

All in all, I'm very happy with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good product with great service.,"I bought two pairs of T10 Bluetooth earbuds for my daughters and they both enjoy them. I find my self borrowing them as well. The sound quality is about what you would get from any decent wired earbuds like a $10-20 pair of Phillips. I connected them to every phone, tablet, TV, PC etc. that has Bluetooth capability that we own and had no connectivity issues. They have been worn in the shower and there was no damage. The batteries seem to keep up with two teenagers who live on their personal devices. The cases are convenient and reasonably fast charging. The case does not seem delicate and magnetically holds the earbuds and lid firmly in place making them great for on the go. The earbuds look pretty slick and not goofy like other designs of various brands. They stay in place with a strong shake of the head and even when tilting an ear hard to one side. As for the support I had to reach out and confirm the extended warranties and the response during their business hours was prompt and courteous with them looking to resolve issues expediently. They answered multiple e-mail replies in the same day. I am very satisfied with the product and the service.

Update: I have fully showered with these several times and rinsed them off with no damage. The water proofing is the real deal as far as I have experienced.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Great sound, easy to use, LOVE the case","I’ve never spent money on nice headphones before. I’ve only ever bought the cheap $20 or less headphones with wires. After using a friend’s super nice ($250 range) headphones of a similar style, I knew I needed a pair, but wasn’t willing to dish out that much (I’m not a sound snob). I absolutely love these. They fit my ears super well (I don’t even feel them once in), stay in, connect SUPER easily to your devices, and the sound quality is great (for the things I do with them).

Good product with a few flaws,"Product gets the job done, but has a couple flaws I wouldn't expect in a $50 product.

1. Microphone is super quiet; no one can hear me well when I use it, so it's basically useless.
2. Volume is too loud; pretty unpleasant to listen to when I'm at the lowest possible volume setting on my phone

Not bad, but I'll be testing some competing products since I'm sure there's something better out there at this price point",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Stellar Sound,"I received these yesterday and love that they came almost fully charged. I connected them right away (I was excited for new headphones, haha.)  I've listened to a few other branded headphones and they were sub par at best. These actually have a full sound. The fit of the ear buds is important, but I immediately switched to the small ear bud size knowing that's what I need. I was definitely not disappointed. These have such full sound. They have full bass and highs without being tinny. The sound is very clear and not muddy. I have daith piercings in both ears and due to these I have a hard time finding ear buds that are comfortable for long wear. These have been great. I've been wearing them all morning. I love that they cancel the noise of the room around me. I can't hear anything when music is going and everything is so much quieter if there is no music going. I love that if I leave the left ear bud in the charging case that it automatically switches the right bud to full sound instead of stereo. (I have quite a few songs that have sound for only left and right ear that pan accordingly but when only one ear bud is synced you don't lose those pieces. I work where I need to use just one ear bud sometimes and so this is an important feature for me. These have great range around the house. I can leave my phone in one room and be in a different room and still have clear sound. I've had problems with other brands and my phone being in my back pocket and cutting out but that's not an issue with these. I have only made one call so far  but the person on the other side said it was clear and easy to hear me. Its easier for me to hear the other person with these than with the iPhone speaker.

I will update once I've had these a little longer.

EDIT: I’ve had these for 9 months now and they still have stellar sound. They are comfortable. I don’t get complaints from the people I call. They charge quickly and hold their charge well. I still highly recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TWS done right,"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.

With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.

Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.

The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.

Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.

Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.

All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disappointing battery life,"I work out in the field. Utility company.  I have used a bunch of headsets, ear buds etc. These are not for me. Battery life is more like 3 or 4 hours. Right bud has to be on so the left can work. With the short battery I tried using right for 3 hours then left. Nope, cant do that. The left needs the right bud to work. Sad, I was hoping this would last my entire shift.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Happy customer,"I have not tried these in swim yet, but I plan to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like it's more bass than mid or high range. The bass comes out beautifully, but the high notes in songs don't come through as well. I have to customize my equalizer on my handset to get it to where I'm happy with how it sounds. I listen to a lot of hip hop and rock, so I need both the bass and the high notes (for those guitar rock solos, yo).

But I'd get them again.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Obvious Quality Control issues...but they made it right!,"EDIT: pleased with customer service! They reached out and offered to send us another complementary set of earbuds. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a new set and they worked perfectly!!!! Yay! Thank you Tozo for going above and beyond to make this right :)

So I wanted to buy a pair of True Wireless Earbuds for myself and my wife.  I received the initial trial pair to try out since I was skeptical at first.  I unboxed the first set and everything worked great.  Both ear buds worked great from the start.  They paired with one another, when placed in the charging cradle, both earbuds indicated they were taking a charge by lighting up and automatically restarted/reconnected out of the cradle.  The sound out the earbuds were impressive and were a comfortable fit.  I was happy with the purchase.  I went ahead and ordered another pair for my wife.  When I got the second pair, I unpacked the TWE and immediately I noticed the left earbud didn't start up right away and pair with the Right.  I had to turn it on and wait for it to pair.  When I placed the earbuds into the charging cradle, I noticed the left earbud did not indicate it was taking a charge by lighting up and did not restart/repair upon taking it out of the cradle.  Both earbuds seemed to work but I had no way of telling the earbuds were taking a charge.  I did not want to risk the purchase so I asked for a replacement.  Amazon of course made excellent on the replacement and I received my third pair.  Sadly when I opened the third pair, I experienced the same issues after unboxing but this time it was the right ear bud acting up.  Again, if it doesn't work properly out of the box, I am inclined to return it right away.  I took a refund on the third pair and will look for a completely different pair.  The initial pair are working good and am happy with them.  I am just disappointing I could not get a second pair for my wife.  I will have to go shopping again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Slim fit great quality works in shower , update review on one stopped","So far I have used these for two days and I really really like them!! They are not obnoxiously big , and have great sound quality. They say they are waterproof also,  if I come into that situation I will have to update this review. I really like the container they come in that also charges them nice quality!
Update so I purchased these on 9/16/19 and as of today the left one will not charge nor work. I have worn them in shower and they work wonderful, just upset on the one that no longer is working. Going to find the 1 year guarantee and see if it’s covered.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth it,I was worried about these at first but I love them! I use them everyday at work and they cancel out the noise to the point I don’t hear people trying to talk to me. There are multiple ear pieces to choose the perfect size for you ears. The battery life could be better but it does last most of my work day if I run them non stop. I would buy these again.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product,  a must try for the price","I was looking for wireless earbuds to try and not go broke in the process. I took a chance on these and I love them!
I had trouble with my  ears being too small since every other product that I tried was too large and heavy that they would just fall out of my ears. These come with several sizes and the small one really did the trick for me. They stayed in my ears even after a 40 minute treadmill run! I have not showered/swam with them on, but I don't think I will ever do, so I can't confirm if they are truly waterproof. I picked the white case so as not to lose them in my black gym bag.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great set for a great price,"Great Earbuds, especially for the price. The bass is perfect and the noise cancelling is very good for a set of Earbuds at this price.

Amazing!!,"I bought these to help for my schooling. I am very pleased with the fast delivery. The sound quality of these is pretty good. The initial setup took me a few minutes to get the right ear bud linked to the left, but i believe that was do to my errors. There is no lag when watching videos. I was able to watch 2 hours worth of lectures for college classes without the need to charge. the case is durable and has good weight to it. I highly recommend these to people. Now i also tried them when working out, but they kept trying to come out when jogging. Walking or other exercises was perfectly fine. Very pleased with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

More Choices Best Fit and Superior Sound Quality!,"The sound quality of the TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds is the best I have ever experienced and because of the tightly fit of the ear caps, the outside noises are mostly reduced into muffled sound which makes the music coming out of the earpieces crystal clear and seemingly coming from all directions. This pair of masterpiece also boasts of its deep bass which makes you feel more like in a theater enjoying live band!

The most crucial thing is to choose the right size ear caps that fit your just right. Fortunately, TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds come with four sets of ear caps making the fitting easier and more precise.

Another convenience is charging. The two ear buds are sucked into their beds and you never worry they will get loose. The capsule can also provide the earbuds at least two or three charges ensuring you continuously enjoy your favorable music all day long. TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds are the best in-ear wireless listening device I have ever had!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Ear Buds!,"I was not knowing what kind of quality to expect from my TOZO T10 wireless bluetooth ear buds. I must admit, I am really pleased and happy with the quality, sounds, and comfort of these buds. The noise canceling quality is so good that I don't have to turn my volume super high to hear my music. Good Rich volume all the way around. I'd encourage everyone to give these babies a try, you won't be sorry!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well put together product for the price!,"The Tozo T10 wireless Bluetooth earbuds are such a great product for the price. Pairing and syncing the earbuds to devices is quick and simple. The sound quality is really exceptional, especially considering the price of them; I was truly surprised. The bass is punchy and mids and highs are well rounded. I find the battery life to be pretty good—I can get about 4 hours of use from them on a single charge. At first I thought that kind of sounded low, but I realized there isn't really a point in time where I have earbuds/headphones in for that long anyway.

The earbuds come with a super cool charging case that is a remote charging battery. You can plug the charging case into any USB device and it will fill the battery pack. You can then place your earbuds into the battery pack which magnetizes and secures them in the sturdy battery case and it will charge your earbuds on the go. The earbuds charge fairly quickly. You can tell they are charging by the red LED light on each earbud. Likewise, the battery charger/case has four (4) LED lights that are blue, which lets you know how much power is available in them.

I really enjoy these earbuds because they are versatile. I primarily use them in an office setting, but I also use them when I walk my dog, or go on long runs/to the gym. They are great and cancelling outside noises, almost a little too good. At work, I have to wear them one so I can overhear if anyone is talking to me/asking me a question—which leads to my one and only complaint—you can't really use these one at a time. If you turn off one headphone, the other will constantly beep as it tries to pair with the earbud that is off. However, I believe you can put the left earbud in the charging case and the right one will still work. In all honesty, it's not really that big of an inconvenience.

Overall, I really enjoy this product and because of their price, I think I will be purchasing multiple pairs to give away for birthday/Xmas gifts.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"High Quality Sound, Clever Technological Features, Comfortable","I primarily use these earbuds to workout. I also use them for general use around the house, because I style my hair and using over-the-head headphones would ruin my hairstyle.

My previous headphones was the Amorno Wireless Headphones. The TOZO T10 is my second set of earbuds. I needed a new set of earbuds because the Amorno Headphones charging case usb connection thing broke (not my fault).

Overall, I definitely noticed that the TOZO T10 yields:
 - Nice/Great sound quality
 - Convenient technological features, such as earbuds turning on automatically when pulling out of charging case AND earbuds turning off automatically when inserting back into the charging case
 - Uses magnets to securely charge the earbuds with the charging case
 - Durable charging case
 - Long lasting charge on the earbuds and charging case
 - It also comes with a 1 year warranty, which I doubt I will need to use because of the quality of the product

Horrible product ! Do not trust reviews!!!!,"Not as expected , doesn’t work well, battery full charged lasted about 2 hours, pairing separately, a nightmare !

Total garbage,"I generally don't take the time to write reviews of products on Amazon but this product was so BAD, I felt it was my duty as a consumer to say something. I was given a pair of Apple Airpods as a gift and I loved them but, as we know, they are crazy expensive and, like a moron, I lost them. So I started looking at what might be a suitable, affordable, alternative. I saw a lot of positive reviews about the TOZO's and so I figured...why not?

Let me tell you why not:
1) Pairing is intermittent. These things connect and disconnect randomly with your device which is really annoying when you're actually trying to talk to people.
2) The battery life is awful. These things die...real fast. The charging case also dies quickly.
3) They are heavy in the ears, which makes them kind of uncomfortable.

I gave them a chance before writing this but today was the final straw. I've had them less than 2 months at this point and today I tried again, I really tried people, but they wouldn't stay connected and cut out during two significant calls. These things are going to be bound for the e-waste facility and I'm going to go find another option. I'm open to any suggestions.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product for the gym,"I like to listen to my iPhone while working out at the  gym, and the T10 is perfect for that.
I love the fact that it is waterproof.

There is an awful lot of background noise at the gym.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones!,"All I can say is wow! Sound quality is excellent,  so much bass I had to turn it down on my phone. Pairing was effortless,  automatically connects both & case that is also the charger is great. Only had them 1 week but so far they exceeded my expectations.  The only question left is longevity,  time will tell",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"a solid ""eh"" out of 10","for the price, it's a pretty decent pair of wireless earbuds, but they're honestly kinda a pain! i've tried all the earbud sizes and none fit right; they always fall out in minutes or are in so tightly they're uncomfortable. recently, my left earbud has stopped connecting with the right ""master"" bud, or when it does connect it periodically disconnects. it's sorta hard to jam out when your earbuds are constantly going ""DISCONNECTED... CONNECTED. RIGHT CHANNEL. LEFT CHANNEL.""

noise cancellation is ok, and the volume is pretty loud (though i honestly wish they could go quieter). there's not any features with the buttons on the sides of the headphones other than pause and play -- no skip function, volume adjustment, etc.. they're shaped very oddly, in a way which makes them very hard to adjust and, again, stay in properly.

i'm kind of mad, especially because i have missed the return deadline by one day, which you can bet your bottom dollar i'd be taking advantage of had these stupid headphones used up the last of my patience even a day sooner. considering how much air pods are going for, this is an okay alternative if it's simply not within your price range, but if it's a matter of taking the time to save up for more pricey, high quality bluetooth headphones, just do it.

tl;dr: these feel like more of a liability than a piece of $50 luxury earbuds. okay if they're the only thing in your price range, but don't expect much comfort or efficiency from them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, when they work...","So just to keep it simple and brief. I ordered first pair of these and was quite excited based on reviews and some research on my part. I found them to be comfortable and simple to use. However, the left earbud would not stay connected and kept going in and out while the right was constant. Did everything I could to reset them and try to get a stable connection. Had a second pair sent and same problem after less than two days of use. Really just disappointed overall. Could have been a great pair of gym earbuds. Guess I’m trying something else.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They lack some features like auto pairing to your phone (at least for me) and you are not really able to listen with only 1 ear bud in unless you have the other one playing in your pocket or something. They also sound good but do have a fair amount of bass, this doesn't bother me too much but worth noting.

Like them but don’t love them,Overall I like these. I don’t love them. They stay in my ears well in the gym but I guess the excess movement the left ear bud cuts in and out constantly.

Hearing Quality Excellent,"Like:
1) Hearing quality is excellent
2) Charging is easy - if you charge up the base fully, you can use that alone to charge up ear buds instead of looking for a plug
3) No problems with connection

Don't Like:
1) Sometimes have to yell for caller to understand or hear what I am saying
2) Listening to music on ear buds, make them die out quicker
3) Right ear bud is dominant, therefore if it dies, the left one automatically stops working also. Both ear buds pair up on your phone, but you can only talk using right bud
4) Haven't figured out how to store them close by when not in use, so ear buds aren't just sitting in ear

Haven't Checked:
1) Waterproof",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great, except one issue","These sound great, last about 3 hours on a charge. But, the left earpiece keeps dropping out and back in. It's only the left ear that does it. Right always stays connected.

Awesome Earbud ..But,"Bought this set after losing my previous single earbud from Focus. The sound is great and they are very effective at blocking out other noises though they are not noise cancelling. The batteries last long enough for me which is my whole shift. I gave  four stars because they tend to fall out of my ear even with the smallest insert. I did not have that problem with my Focus power ear bud. I am 5'8"" , 145.

Good headphones when they're working...,"Pros: Great sound quality. Fits in my ear perfectly. Case charges fast

Cons: You can't listen to the left without the right. But you can listen to the right without the left. Very sensitive, I dropped my right one on the floor and now it doesn't work. Which is bad because now I can't listen to my left one because my right one doesn't work.

Finally a good set of bluetooth headphones,"I actually bought 4 pairs of these, one for each member of the family.  After looking through Amazon for a good pair of bluetooth headphones it was nice to find some with REAL reviews for the product listed.  These Tozo T10 headphones have been great so far.  The charging case has 4 LEDs that show it's power level, and the headphones themselves have a little light that lights up when they're charging as well. The charging case cover is translucent so you can see the charging light and the headphone light through it, so you don't have to open it to know the status of either.  Sound quality has been fine and calls work well on them.  We have 4 iPhones in the house that these are connected to and we've not had any pairing or connection issues.  Wireless charging seems to work fine as well, or you can use the supplied USB cable to charge the case if you don't have a wireless charging pad.

You cannot skip songs with these,If you are looking for a little bass...these are not the headphones for you. They are loud and have a lot of treble...good for Metal. Bad thing about these is you cannot skip songs. A double click will redial your last number called. I'm not sure if I will keep these...only because sometimes...you just got to skip the next song in the middle of a workout.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great hardware marred by poor firmware design decisions,"Firstly, the hardware for these earbuds are really great. I love the fact that the button is a clicky push button instead of the capacitive buttons you see on many of these headphones. Good battery life though I haven't tested extensively. The case a a little large to be comfortable in a front pocket but not terrible. Not too heavy, pretty comfortable in the ear and really good sound.

The issue with these is that a couple small things ruin the overall experience for me. Firstly, I use 1 earbud at a time a lot, probably more than I use both together. When you first put a single earbud in your ear it connects then searches for the other earbud to connect. The problem with this is that, whoever wrote the firmware for these, decided it would be a good idea to have the earbud beep every time it runs the search for the other earbud. So, every 7 seconds or so for about a minute after you put it into your ear, it beeps at you and there is nothing you can do but wait for it to time out. For someone who puts the buds in and out of his ears many times throughout the day this got old and unacceptable real fast.

The other issue is that the LED on the earbuds will blink briefly every 5 seconds as long as they're on, just to remind you that they're there. Why?! If I have these on at night listening to something while my wife falls asleep, these things are practically lighting up the room. Again, nothing you can do about it.

It's really a shame since I really love these headphones otherwise. Fix those 2 lines of code and I will gladly use these but, for now, they are getting returned before they drive me insane.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Amazing bluetooth earbuds for the price,"Usually, you would pay about $100 for a decent set of Bluetooth earbuds, but these are a great bargain. The earbuds connect easily to your phone and the volume is loud. I keep mine at a low volume and still get a full immersion experience. They cancel outside noise to a high level to the point I could not hear car honk the horn right outside of my house. The battery lasts about 4 - 5 hours of continuous play time and the earbuds charge super fast in the carrying case. My only gripe is that the earbuds tend to come out from time with jolting movements. I ride my bike and hit bumps and an earbud has come out in on two occasions. Make sure you have the right size ear piece on for your ear but that still will not prevent the occasional loosening from extreme movement. I had no problem with them coming out when doing a gym workout.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The sound goes out in both buds.,"Recently I bought these earbuds, I bought them because they were way cheaper than any other wireless earbuds I was looking at. At first I loved them! They connected to phone in seconds, the sound and noise cancelation was awesome. But recently the sound will go out... at first it was just the left bud (I thought I was because of the distance of my phone, but then remember that the phone could be 100 (?) meters away and still play), but now it's both buds. I would love to keep using their products but I dont have the money to keep buying them. (Bought: April 12, 2019)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for what I need!,"Incredibly convenient and compact. I went running with these and I had no issues with them moving around or falling out. They have great sound quality too. These are great because my wife and I can each use one while watching a movie on my phone and we aren't restricted to a 1 foot radius because of a cord.

The only complaint is that it doesn't totally cancel out the noise around you, but for the price I paid it is definitely a great pair of headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No regrets!,This product is awesome!!! I love bass and this thing be boomin! This earpiece set gives quality sound and makes you feel like it’s just you and the music in the room regardless of who is around or if the tv is on.  As far as the fitting - won’t stay put in my ears but I have that problem with Apple headphones too so 🤷🏽‍♀️ ...it just may be my ears! 😆,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Incredible sound quality!!,"These were easily one of the best purchases I've made. Definitely very soundproof/noise canceling (I wear them at work all the time and can't hear I thing happening around me 😆). The bass is awesome, it feels like your body is vibrating not just your head. They stay in place when you have the them in after you adjust them to the right angle for you. The only thing I would say to work on is while they are extremely water proof, when I shower with them in they keep slipping out of my ear. Maybe look into making a detachable ear hook piece for each earbud to help stay in place for people like me? Other than that, pretty much flawless.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"TOZO T10 EARBUDS, BEST CHOICE FOR THE MONEY ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Great sound and fantastic price.  Best earbuds out on the market .  I am so glad that i bought these and didnt put out the $169 for the apple earbuds as i originally planned.  Only one thing bad about them, i let my wife use them once and she kept them.  I have to buy another pair.  Great base.....you wont be sorry...
Follow up review, 1 month update:  the earbuds are absolutely out of this world, when i can pry them out of my wifes ears.  Wear them at gym and they never even move, great sound.  Company contacted me by email and informed me they were going to send me a free tozo wireless charger.  Just got it and it is a quality product, works great and is free.  The only drawback is that the company is in china and it takes 2-4 weeks to arrive.  BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!  PRICE IS GREAT!  Hannah the lady i dealt with through email, was top notch and very courteous.  1/3 of the price of apples ear buds, and just as good if not better....⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Ok, but.....","I was pretty hyped up to try these but I was quickly disappointed.  Headphones work great when I'm looking directly at my phone but when the phone goes into my pocket.... sound cuts out intermittently.

Updated Review:
I'm updating my review from 1 star to 4 stars
It seems that my headphones cut out when I'm in the gym in front of the dumbbell racks.  When I'm in other areas of the gym, they seem to be fine.  Outside the gym they are great and haven't had an issue.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pros and Cons,"This is great for sedimentary uses. I tried to use these for a jog and the earbuds kept falling out. It has great call quality, but the sound quality isnt the best (what can you expect from 45$ earbuds??) Lastly, when I was first pairing it with my phone, holy guacamole... it was a bit of a challenge. I had to play with it for a while even after reading the instructions. Battery life is great.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Kept falling out,"There were several problems with this product: The sound quality was great but they would lose syc with each other and constantly break up. Another is that they just didn't go far enough in the ear canal to really stay in, 1/4"" deeper in and they would be perfect! Sent them back and got another pair and those are going back too! SAME ISSUES!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not Too Shabby,"Overall, these are pretty nice Earbuds. The tips are on the cheap side, but the rest of this package is better than average.
The Bluetooth can cut out if you have a thick head, or bury the buds too deep into your ears. The carrying/charging case is a nice touch. You can also purchase the passive charge pad (which I did), that works just like a pad for your phone would charge. I'm on the fence as to whether the price is justified...",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sleek Look however poor sound,"Just purchased these a week ago and i have to admit, these might be the lowest sounding wireless earbuds i have ever purchased.  With my volume at max, the sound might only reach half the volume of say my bluephonic, focuspower or smartomi earbuds.  Such is disappointing because I do like the look of these and the case that it came with is pretty cool since it can charge the buds up to 4 times.

Edit: Increasing my rating,  Customer service was actively trying to work with me and replace item as well as provide additional support products.  Because of that i have increased the rating.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality for a great value,"This is my fourth pair of wireless earbuds I've tried (all from various makers) and have enjoyed these most. Buds are lightweight and comfortable. They also seem to recharge much faster than the previous earbuds I've had in the past.

The only complaint I have with them is connectivity. As long as there's nothing blocking the beam they work wonderfully, but when trying to pass through, say a human body, they tend to cut out frequently.

Overall, however, a worthwhile purchase!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Quality,"Wow..!!! I did not expected it to be that GOOD. The sounds were amazing. Bass & Treble were exceptional. Love it. I really enjoyed these Bluetooth Earbuds.
These are amazing and worth the money. The packaging it's good. The charging case is well built and won't open in your pocket. Ear buds are comfortable, have amazing clarity, bass,treble. Easy to pair up. Best thing is it comes with an extended 1 year warranty, you can't beat that.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Beautiful earbuds with fast connection,"I love the feel and look of it, ordered a white one. The case feels sturdy and has a strong snap once it's closed, it's about the length of my plam, approximately 3 inches long.

The sound quality is nice however I did hear a bit static here and there but not very noticable. The first time I used it to watch a video, there was no delay then I used it a second time to watch a video, I noticed a very faint delay but maybe it was because I had been using the earphones for quite a while and draining the battery, I'm not sure but will update later. I will say that these earbuds connect very fast! I was very impressed at the connection of it. I did use it for calling and the sound is crisp and clear. The person on the other line did hear me well and there were minimal to no background noise from my end of the call.

I had to give this rating a 4/5 stars. Why? The earbuds do not stay in my ear very long. It falls out constantly and I had to fix it by jamming it into my ears. I've changed the the tips to the various sizes that came along with the product and still it keeps falling out. At first I thought it was just my ears but my boyfriend has the same earbuds too and his falls out as well. I'm wondering if these earbuds are compatible with the ear clips? I'll have to find out and will update this.

The direction was very clear and easy to follow however, I do recommend the company to change its names for the right earbuds and left earbuds. The right earbud is the leading/main earbud and the left earbud follows, in the manual, it was called ""master"" and ""slave."" Mmm, wrong choice of words. If those are fixed, then I say it's a positive manual.

Not all bluetooth earbuds are perfect, everything will have its flaws. But so far I've been impressed with this device and definitely recommend it. If it didn't fall out of my ear, it would've received a 5/5 stars. The package arrived the very next day after I ordered it so I'm content.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bluetooth earbuds at a reasonable price,"I have owned other more expensive and less expensive earbuds and this set is probably the best I bought given the price range. Setup was easy and straight forward. Audio quality is decent, not far away from even those that are more expensive. It does come with different sizes of buds so it will fit your ears. Quality is excellent, looks well built and solid. I am using for my workout to replace a pair that I lost, so I will provide more updates in the coming months.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Exceptional Wireless Earbuds!  Great Customer Service,"These earbuds are great .  Pairing and connecting was easy little effort required.  Sound quality is great.  I work in a loud warehouse and the sound is outstanding.  I like the effortless recharging of the earbuds in their dock.  I can't believe wireless charging of the dock.  A great value.  I purchased these to see if my ears would tolerate them before spending $130 to $250 dollar earbuds.  I am sold, don't think I will purchase the higher priced ones.  Might buy more of these TOZOS earbuds.

Ear pieces,"I seriously like these. However, the rubber buds are horrible for my ears. I wound up putting my old Skull Candy pieces on to get the deep bass I want along with the comfort. Update: The body of the bud hurt my left ear after I spent a couple of days rotating it back to get better bass depth. I still like these but I just want to worn against doing such a thing. I wear them all day long since I work in a loud environment. Now I can only use my right bud for a while until my ear heals.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are legit!,"I've probably have gone through near 10 style earbuds in the last 15 years ranging from wired, bluetooth to truly wireless bluetooth, but these are by far the best in every column. Whether it be the price, battery life, noise cancelling, sound quality, pairing, staying connected and I can keep going on!

They were simple to pair, charge and stay connected. I've had very few drops in connection, it might be interference from someone else being in proximity with their own bluetooth device(s). I'm enjoying the fact that while at the gym, I can block out all the noise around me without blowing out my ears at 100% max, be able to walk freely around the weight room without hardly any interference whether by equipment or other gym goers technology. I'm not audiophile, but it sounds really good, bass doesn't sound blown out. Battery life is spectacular, an hour of continuous use only consumes 20% of battery life and doesn't take long to fully charge as well, I don't think I've seen it drop below 80% after a gym session. Being waterproof, I don't have to fear washing my face after the sauna with them on.

We'll see how they last long term, but as of right now they are perfect for anyone who likes a quality product that has good sound, noise cancellation and phenomenal battery life.  They might be the simplest bluetooth device I have. They just work every time without connection issues.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO is an amazing company!,"I bought these because they had great reviews. And it's true, they do sound great. They stay in my ears well. I use the smallest ear hole pad that they supplied and they fit well and are not uncomfortable. I use them often in the pool but according to the instructions they don't recommend staying under water with them for too long, which is not a problem for me as I usually just chill on float anyhow.

But what makes TOZO a  great company is that after two months I was having trouble with the right bud so I sent an email asking about my warranty. They responded the same day and were very sympathetic. Two days later there were brand new headphones on my doorstep. This was some of the best customer service I have ever experienced!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for price!,"I’ve been searching for a new pair of headphones that are wireless, comfortable, stay put and can be used in the tub. These fit the bill and def are a decent price. I was also happy to have a 1 year warranty attached to the product. The sound is also quite impressive. My biggest complaint would be that I can not adjust the volume from the headphones themselves.

Useless battery life,"Do not buy these, I have been using them for 10 months. First, the connection is weak, you constantly hear the hopping sound of them trying to connect even long causes disconnection.

Buds are just ok,"I've bought a bunch of Bluetooth wireless headphones and buds.  These could be the best.  But some things that I don't like are that with phone in my front pocket when walking or bike riding the buds disconnect.  Weird because I can leave phone in one room walk to next and keep connection.  Decent sound but not Beats level, but not Beats price.  I bought 3 of these so I can cycle through each if one charge.  I still have plug in beats buds that I like for certain situations and these for more mobile use and when charging phone.  These should really be 4.5

Been using two pairs for several months now. I will not use these for phone calls.  And I still loose connection turning my head or when walking or riding bike and phone is on one side.

Great bass and mids,"The bass is incredible as are the mids. Drum sound is better than any earbuds I've listened to at this price point. Sound is clear and realistic. The highs get a little muddled but I found a solution for that. I replaced the tips with a pair of Comply SmartCore tips. They make a huge difference in the sound most noticeable in the highs, which now sound as good as the rest. The buds pair very well and fit nicely.

Great Value for Money,"I am a runner and honestly pretty hard on on my equipment.  Running in the rain, heat, and freezing weather will chew through shoes, headphones, and smart watches pretty quickly.  I have used a pair of Bose Sound Sports for several years now and had to replace them 3 times.  These were always under warranty, but most recently after getting my new Soundsports back, they were overheating and failing in less than a week.

I was not excited to drop another 150-200 dollars on headphones, so I decided to give these Tozo T10 wireless buds a try.

Sound:  The sound is great.  Really good stereo effects and I can crank the sound up and really blast music/movies.
Fit: I have a weird ear canal.  The medium fits as well as any other bud, but I still pull my headband down over them to make sure they don't fall out while I am running.
Battery Life:  It is true to its word which is about 3 hours which is less than I am used to, but again it matches what is advertised.
Range: This is the biggest issue with these.  I get a bit of interference when I am running and my phone is on my running belt.  This is not enough to cause major distress, but again it is less than what I would prefer.

All in all, for the price, after a week and probably 10 hours of use, I am very pleased with the Tozo T10 buds.

The charging case is durable as well.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Only 6 hours of use in 4 days....then died,"The first day I used these rhe sound kept coming and going from both left and right earbud. I left them charging overnight and the same thing happened on my next day of use at the gym. I used these for a total.of 4 times and each time.for no longer than 1.5 h that I train at the gym. The sound cancellation is not that great as I was able to hear the constant rattle and noises of the gym. At its 5th day they automatically decided to shut down. I heard a voice say ""power off"" , that was not a happy day at the gym. So I cahrged them.for 2 days and still no response. Word of advise save yoirself the money and buy better quality products.

If you only use one earpiece and it won't stop beeping!,"I was getting so frustrated trying to use just the right earpiece but there was a constant beeping every 10 seconds or so - rendering the earpiece utterly useless!  I scoured the eleventy billion Q&A on the product page and nothing seemed to actually address the issue until I found the answer deep in the bowels of all the questions.

For one earpiece use without the constant beeping you have to start by taking BOTH ear pieces out out of the case, let them pair with each other, let them pair with the device - THEN - after those steps are done you can put one of the earpieces back into the case and while you'll hear a disconnect notice and another annoying beep that's it!  No more constant beeps and the remaining earpiece will still be connected to the device.

Sound as good as wired and DOES have a USB charger (in the case) and cable.,"I've always used regular earbuds with my phone to listen to podcasts or music while I mow the lawn. The Pixel 3 came with no headphone jack, and the USB earbuds that came with it rest in your ear , rather than actually sticking in the ear and 'sealing'. In addition, the USB headphones don't work with the belt case I have for it, so I needed to consider other options.  I was a bit wary of these, my concerns being if they would be loud enough and 'seal' against the ear hole well enough to cover the noise of the mower, and secondly whether they would stay put. Ultimately I was very pleased, and honestly surprised how well they stayed once you got them right (not REAL easy, but I'm glad it's POSSIBLE to take the time and get them seated perfectly).  In addition, while I wouldn't mind if they were able to go a hair higher, I don't know that I'll ever actually need it any higher, I just like a little headroom. But both music and podcast were plenty loud and full, and came through clearly over the mower noise that did get past the seal.
The case is great too, charges on my 'Pixel Stand' (wireless charger) and for those who like me didn't find it clear from the description, it DOES have a USB charging port in the case and includes a USB cable. It ALSO allows wireless charging while in the case, which is a nice touch for the price. They're $50 headphones any day of the week, even without the wireless charging, so including that is great, and will become even more handy as wireless chargers become ubiquitous.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left Earbud Failure - Seems to Be a Chronic (and Common) Issue **UPDATED**,"Updated 09 OCT 2019 - received the replacement earbuds quickly and packaged perfectly!  Unfortunately, they have the exact same issue as the original ones... they work and sound amazing inside, but as soon as I go outside the left earbud breaks up.  These would be great if I only wanted them for inside, but that isn't the case.  Sending these back as well....

This is a perfect example of ""I should have read the reviews.""  I was initially very happy with these earbuds.  Charging and connection were pretty seamless, sound quality and noise cancelling (while initially wearing them in the house) was great!  During my first attempt to wear them while walking outside, the left earbud kept going in and out (as described in so many other reviews).  I unpaired and repaired, as well as unpaired from other devices, thinking it may reset the earbuds and possibly eliminate interference... but no change.  After returning home I reset the earbuds per the instruction manual and again they worked great inside the house...but just walking into the backyard made the left earbud fade again.
I have scheduled to return these earbuds to Amazon and will give the replacements a try.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews and identify the number of similar issues until after I elected to replace rather than just return for refund.  Fingers crossed my replacements won't have the issue.  I'll update the review after receipt.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Over exceeding product!,"I couldn't hear people calling my name, so the cancellation was amazing.

Sound quality, I hated it because i was expecting something far less for the price they were offering. I would easily put these up against ANY other earbuds. Bass is deep and crisp. The highs and lows are balanced.

I'm not sure about the battery life that's why I gave it a 4. I havent used it for more than 3 hours yet so I'm just giving a honest post. But the 4 star can also go to one minor flaw in the making of the device, and that the button on the earbuds. It's kinda hard to push if it were a touch feature or a easier to push button this would kill and bud in the market.

It pairs easily with out hassle. Plus if you cant read the instructions then maybe you dont need these earbuds. Overall a 5 star product!!! Thanks guys!!!!!!!!!!!🎶🎵🎧",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

BUY THIS PRODUCT,"These earphones are honestly the best purchase I've ever made. I'm a really picky person so this is an honest opinion of this product. The tozo earbuds really do secure onto your ears without any chance of it falling off especially during a workout which is full of movement. I've had these for about a month and these are great for the price and quality and comparable to Apple Earbuds or dare i saw BETTER.

I recently lost my carging case in which the eabuds go in and I applied for the year time warranty discussing the incident and they responded the next day reassuring me they can do some arrangements for the loss. I'm currently waiting what the next step is so I'll keep you updated! Also when applying for the 1 year warranty they added a free wireless charger so I'm excited to see how that goes.

The only issue I have would be the packaging in terms of actually securing it somethere like a keychain specialized for the case since I did lose mine. Obviously it was my fault but the extra security would've definetly helped",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
LOVE MY TOZO WIRELESS BLUETOOTH STEREO EARBUDS!!!,Finally wireless blue tooth earbuds that have excellent sound and seem to be top quality for the price.  I have shopped and shopped for weeks and feel so very fortunate to have found these little treasures.  So easy to pair with my smartphone and right away I could hear beautiful crisp sound.  And my calls are crystal clear too.  I use these earbuds at work to help me decrease my stress while I concentrate on my projects.  I usually work 2 hours at a time and the battery seems to last a little past that time.  Everything feels so sturdy and expensive.  The only issue I have is the USB cord that came with the unit didn't fit and I had the darn-est time trying to open the USB charger port.  With some real effort I finally opened it.  I was offered the free wireless charger sent to my home by customer service.  Great service and support.  Great purchase and warranty.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
First week it broke but support was quick to help!,"I was very impressed with these earbuds! They hold a great charge and they sound great for the price! Although within the first week one of the charging pins fell off, but these earbuds come with a one year warranty! The support was nice and quick about getting a replacement out. Took about a week to get a new charging case, other than that these earbuds are definitely worth it for the price!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value for a good price,"I purchased this product for the purpose of daily walking as well as conference calling. Pairing with my iPhone is automatic out of box. The receiving audio quality was great with the first trying. I was a little concerned about microphone at the beginning since I did not put them in correctly. But once I adjust the position, the microphone works great! Great value!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
works really good! and the quality is excellent !,"If you want to buy a wireless earbud , this is the one for you, good price!, great sound and quality , the battery is good too, last enough time and you can charger again with the case , even call you can make and the quality is fair , I highly recommend this product! great purchased !!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Overall,"These are great Earbuds, the sound quality is awesome, connectivity is great. I only have two small issues. I cannot control the volume from these and they tend to fall out so hoping the other size ear covers will help them stay in.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome Customer Service,"I used these buds for several months.  Sound is excellent particularly in the bass which was what I was looking for.  I give 5 stars for performance.

However, I did have an issue.  I could not get the buds to charge.  I stewed over what to do for some time.but I did finally figure how to reach out for customer service.  I sent my message at 10:30pm Sunday night and at 4:12am Monday morning I  had a most generous and convenient offer to send me a new wireless charger f.o.c.!  How about that for customer service?  So 5 stars also for outstanding post sales support.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
[Update 2] Great deal,"Used it with my Galaxy S6 and returned it the next day. The sound quality was nothing of note, it did it's job when I was walking the dog. But turning my head or having my phone move around in my pocket caused frequent disconnects that drove me up the wall.

The case and build quality were great, the sound was okay, just the connection that drove me to return them.

[Update]
Tozo customer service rep contacted me about the product and indicated that my headphones might have been defective and that they were going to send me a new pair to try. Updated to 4 stars for the customer service, and will update again upon receiving the new buds.

[Update 2]
After receiving a new pair (Thanks to Christina at Tozo), there have been zero problems with connections. Put my phone in my room, closed the door, walked into the bathroom and downstairs. Zero disconnects. While the sound quality is not as good as my daily headphones (Senn 650's), the quality is not bad and the IPX8 rating means my sweat is not going to be a factor.

For $50, these are a damn steal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality,"I tired multiple wireless ear buds and these were the best. Waterproof, so no need to worry about how much you sweat. Great sound quality. The new headphones today tend to amplify the Bass which is annoying to me. These produce clear, true sound. The design is excellent and fits my ear very well. Noise cancelling is dependent on getting the correct fit with the included ear pieces in multiple sizes.. I recommend that you use the largest one that fits your ear to get the best noise cancellation.
Bottom line -  Great product, excellent value, GREAT customer service.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Must buy for the price and quality,Can’t say enough about these earbuds for the price I feel your getting everything the more expensive earbuds provide. After doing me research the only thing that these earbuds don’t have that 200$ earbuds have is about 2hrs more battery life . I haven’t had a problem with battery running out while using them and if so I would just put them in the Wireless charging case provided. Of witch other brands charge more for wireless charging case. All in all I’ll take a couple less hours of battery to save 150$ and have a premium waterproof pair of earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bright blinking lights main problem... few others,"Returned these after a few days. Reasons:

1. Like to listen to podcasts/music while going to sleep. These have pretty bright blinking lights in the dark—wife didn’t appreciate it and plus I felt like a freakin borg.
2. These are a bit chunky/heavy. I have pretty normal size ears for a 6ft guy and I had to put on the smallest earpiece cover to approach comfort
3. Bluetooth pairing was a bit fussy. These were the first Bluetooth headphones I’ve tried so maybe this is normal, but they got confused between my iPhone and iPad and would unpair/pair sporadically until I made sure Bluetooth was deactivated on all devices except the one I wanted to use.
4. Seconding what another reviewer said about racially insensitive language in the manual: referring to the left and right as “slave” and “master”?? Cmon wtf is wrong with you? Creepy and a turnoff.

Other than that, pretty good sound I guess?",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality but not connected underwater,"I was super excited to get these! I love that they came with smaller ear bud covers because now they fit my ears perfectly and don’t fall out. I swam with them and unfortunately I cannot go completely underwater with them or they lose connection. I think if I had a waterproof iPod they would stay connected. The Bluetooth connection of my phone is only good for like 10 feet, so putting my phone in the middle of the pool would work best.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality for the price,"I use these earbuds to listen to class lectures on my laptop. They are such an upgrade from the Apple earbuds I was using, which I found very uncomfortable to have in my ears for hours at a time. I especially like that there are different ear bud cap sizes provided to find a fit that works for you. If you're the type of person that is really into peak sound quality and very picky about that, these probably aren't for you. I still use my Beats to headphones listen to music. I would say that given the price, the quality of these are pretty good and I would recommend them to a friend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and great customer service!,I only received one pair of ear caps. The larger ones but the instructions says to try on all of them but there is only one size in package. But the company has already replied and sending them to me me. The sound is great and when I receive the new caps I’m sure even better. Customer service has been top notch! Thanks Tozo,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Product-And they fit any ear!,I literally have to wear the right Apple bud in my left ear and the left in my right ear because they do not fit me! These come with options to fit different ear sizes and they fit great.I love to listen to something while walking my dog and hated being wired up to me phone. These solved that problem and the walk is much more enjoyable! Support is great also....had one bud stop working after just 35 days and they replaced it with no questions asked. Definitely recommend.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Quality Surprised Me!,"I received my earbuds a day or so earlier than I expected.  They were packaged very well, and arrived undamaged.  They're pretty intuitive, but I followed the directions, got everything charged up, and started pairing them with all my electronic stuff.  I have paired them with my iphone, ipad, Lenovo PC, and my Samsung smart TV.  I love it!  And when they're in your ears, very little sound gets through from the outside.  Also, I didn't realize when I purchased them, that the case is also a charger.  I'm sure it said it, but I didn't notice it, so that was an extra bonus for me.  I have no idea how well these work with an Android, but they sure work well with Apple products.  Get some today!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound for the Price,"For the price the sound quality is great!  I use them on the plane and can't hear any extraneous noise when playing music through them.

The noise canceling is basically the result of plugging your ears with buds.  There doesn't appear to be any type of active cancelling.

The only thing I'm disappointed with the is the case which is used to charge the buds.  It does not hold a charge well when the buds are not actively charging.  I had the case fully charged along with the buds and after a few days of no use the case lost about half its charge.  The buds themselves seem to hold a charge pretty well.  I've only had this product for about a month so time will tell.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Affordable, elegant, and sounds awesome.","With the TOZO Bluetooth earbuds, I was blown away at the sound quality, the design, the fit, and ease of use. As someone who has larger ears, standard earbuds are always falling out. The sound cancelling is so good, people have to tap me on the shoulder at work to get my attention.  These earbuds are a great buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great fit and sound!,"I purchased this ear pods as a gift, and the owner reports the following:

The pairing of the ear pods went well without a hitch, though they needed to be paired again. It's just a matter of following the directions exactly.

The sound quality is excellent, with great stereo separation. The bass sounds very good, too. Also, the range of the ear pods is great, in this case it was greater than the 10 meter range described in the manual.

The ear pods fit snugly in the ear and are unlikely to fall off like Apple's Airpods. The fact that Tozo's ear buds come with four sizes of nubs for the ears is also great.

If there is something that could be improved is the ""L"" and ""R"" markings on the ear pods could be lighter in color, as the color is very close to the color of the pods themselves.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best TW earbuds I’ve ever used!,"Love these earbuds!  They have a great sound quality when worn properly.  Easy to use, easy to connect and very durable.  So much better than all the others I’ve tried including the little white ones from the fruit company that won’t stay in my ears!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds,"I recently got these earbuds to replace my older wired earbuds I use while I'm at the gym. The Tozo T10 earbuds are great! The sound is really good to me! I listened to drum&bass music, metal, rap, and classical to test out the sound and everything sounded crisp and clean. The wireless charging feature is fantastic! I keep them on a wireless charging pad I have in my car so they are always ready to go when I get to the gym! The charging care is also super nice, and pairing them to my iPhone was really easy. Also the instant on feature is awesome!

Just get them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Earbuds I've been searching for years!,"I've always had difficulties finding a set of earbuds that fit comfortably and sound good, at a convenient price. I've bought many pairs over the years that would have a tendency to pop out of my ear, even changing to the different size inserts. I've resorted to buying the corded buds with the ear loop. These would become uncomfortable after awhile and just didn't want to mess with them. I was using a pair of padded, over the ear headphones at the gym but didn't have a good Bluetooth earbud solution until I got these TOZO T10s! They fit fantastically and are comfortable for long periods of time. The sound actually blew me away and have been impressed with them! I have them connected toy Fitbit Ionic and just love it!!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Range,"The range distance is a bit disappointing. I'm still testing it but, so far I couldn't go from by bed room to the kitchen. I didn't even make it there and it's not that far away. That being said, I'm very very happy with it so far.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They Work Mostly,"They work for the majority of the time but the sound cuts out everyone now and then for a split second.
Not the biggest deal in the world but it would be better if they never cut out.
The sound itself is alright.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible Value!,"These are incredible! I bought these headphones to replace a different brand of earbuds that stopped functioning.  The earbuds arrived quickly and in a great carrying case. They pair with each other quickly and then quickly pair with my phone.  The sound quality is incredibly clear with a rich sound.  The base is very strong.  The noise blocking feature is an added bonus, I hear very little environmental noise while outside.  These will be great for my next flight.  Customer service has been superb, checking to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase, unusual in today’s world.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to buy a good quality affordable pair of earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for at home listening if not picky about sound quality,"Sound quality sounded great for the first few uses. After that, it seems to have dropped pretty significantly. They cannot handle the “bass booster” equalizer on Spotify without sounding like crap. These are what I’d consider average sound quality these days.

While working out in a crowded gym, the Bluetooth is virtually useless. Sometimes I’ll get through an entire song without the music cutting out, other times it cuts out every 5 seconds. Very frustrating.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Consistent! Worth the money!,"So... I'm new to these bluetooth earbuds. I had to buy a few in order to find that these were my pick. What's good about these is that they're consistent all around. Solid sound quality, especially for the price, good build, easy to connect, and no drops in sound despite being bluetooth. That was my big gripe with the Tribit, which I do not recommend. Much clearer mids as well, lesser treble and bass though.

It also has a pretty good range, despite some reviews. Can kind of go through walls.  Just don't count on being more than 10-15 feet away from your casting device. Overall, very solid buy, excellent bang for your buck. Jack of all trades, and just generally good all around.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty legit,"So I honestly bought these strictly because it had over 10thousand reviews and was rocking out 4 1/2 stars.
The reviews and star rating are spot on! I instantly fell in love with these when I was comparing them to some of the other “true wireless” earbuds I got. They fit snuggly in my ear, the sound is GREAT and it does cancel out the outside noise fairly well. Definitely would recommended to others and worth every penny",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Battery life and tonal quality,"I replaced my OEM AirPods I used with my iPhone with these.  Great fit in the ear, waterproof, great sound and battery life...  a sturdy wireless or wired charging case... who could want more ...",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Legit Wireless for the Price,"I work out 6 days a week and need a good, durable set of earbuds. So far, these hold up. I've had two sets of PowerBeats Wireless and two sets of Bose. Wear and tear sets in pretty quickly, so I was tired of spending $200-$250 on a new set. Came across these and decided to go the alternative route after reading the reviews. Obviously, I was worried about quality and sound given the price point, but these can stand toe to toe with the top brands I've used in the past. Great sound that drowns out gym noise, no distortion even at max volume and the portable battery pod is awesome. They fit comfortably in my ears and only come a bit loose when I'm doing high impact moves.

What a product for the price. As someone who wears earbuds daily, these are a great get.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works Well So Far,"Had the earbuds for two weeks. They seem to work as advertised. The sound is great..lots of nice base. They connected very easily to my iphone.  Lasted about 3.5 hours on a full charge. Not great for phone calls but acceptable....music however sounds really good. Only concern would be how long they will last based on other reviews I have read.here. Will post an update on longevity if i have any issues. FYI, these will totally plug your ears and you wont be able to hear any outside noise which can be a strange feeling. Also, I paid 49.99 for the earbuds and they are now on sale for 29.99 which is a little annoying.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect For the Price,"First off, these are really well built for the price. They feel sturdy, not cheap. Even the case feels good.

Second, they fit comfortably in my ear. I've been wearing bulky wireless headphones because I've never been able to find earbuds that would actually stay in my ear. I'm fairly active and previous earbuds would just keep falling out. But my headphones get crazy hot when I'm active. I was skeptical at first, but these earbuds are great! Follow the instructions (a simple twist in the ear) that come with them otherwise they won't fit right. I've been out but riding my bike, mowing my yard, and chasing my dog and these have remained firmly in my ears. I'm extremely impressed.

The sound quality is great. I didn't notice any difference between these and my headphones. That's all I could really ask for. Another feature is that you can use the Right earbud independently, but not the other way around. Not a huge deal, but nice when you still want to hear what's going on around you when you still want to listen to music or a podcast.

There's a lack of versatility with these buds. I mainly use them to listen to music and the only controls available are play/pause. The other controls are for phone calls. And it's only one button for everything. There's no volume control. You can't skip forward/backward on your playlist.

Battery is what you'd expect for the price. It's good, but not great. My headphones could get double the play time, but again I'm going for convenience here so I was willing to sacrifice. The case is able to charge the earbuds up to 3 times, so that's a plus. But now I have to carry around a case of I go on longer excursions.

The Bluetooth range is about the same as my headphones. Maybe a little bit less. I usually have my phone nearby anyways so it's not a huge deal to me. And if you don't have a smartwatch you need to keep your phone close by because of the lack of audio controls on the earbuds.

I gave these 5-stars because these are really great for the price. I was sick and tired of my bulky headphones making my head hot and these have exceeded my expectations so far. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for their first pair of affordable wireless earbuds.

Pros: well built, PRICE, good sound quality, charging case included, convenient

Cons: lack of audio controls, average battery life",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Jah definitely Feel!!!,"Update -

So all y'all saying these pods fall out of your ear and ish, need to change the bud size that comes in the box. That solved the issue for me. They snug af. Jah heard?

Yo, unpacked these little pods or whatever you wanna call them. I've used plenty of earphones, headphones, bluetooth headsets and all failed me for one reason or another. Sometimes, the audio quality was excellent and the call quality sucked major a$$.

Very Satisfied,"Had these for a few months now. Really happy. Great range, probably 40-50 feet before they disconnect. Great sound quality for my needs, gym, sometimes at work. No issues pairing to my phone (Google Pixel 3). For some reason I find the Apple style airpods horribly uncomfortable, no issue with these as far as comfort. Charge lasts for ages (I use between 3-4 hours a day and can easily go 3 to 4 days between charging the unit), and earbuds recharge quickly once you put them back in the case. Would definitely recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Quality,"I am completely impressed with the Tozo T10.
The matte black case, sturdy plastic that facilitates cleaning. It also has an anatomical shape that gives a good grip on the hand. The strap of the box can be used to attach to the briefcase or backpack.
The  earbuds are perfect and extremely comfortable to wear.
No matter how much I jumped, they stayed in place! The important thing is to find the ideal shape that fits your ear.
Pairing them with my phone was very easy. All you have to do is remove them from the charging box and they are ready for pairing (just a quick note, make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right headset is the main one).
The sound quality is impeccable with good highs and lows with a good amount of bass. The sound is much better than what I have in my car!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Base,These Earbuds are amazing 😉 I ride a Harley Davidson that  has a pretty loud exhaust system on it and when riding on back country roads with the Tozo earbuds in I can’t hear my exhaust!

Great product and support,"Great headphones for a fantastic price.  Use them during my workouts and handle both sweat and pool just fine.  Fits well in my ear with no risk of falling out during workout.

I did have on problem and reached out for support, which was handled quickly and professionally.  Nice when a company stands behind the products.

Pretty good piece of equipment,Received these yesterday and have been very satisfied so far.. sound quality is solid no distortion. They dont fall out through my.entire 5 mile run and that is key for me.. wish battery life could be a little longer.. it will run out of charge during an 18 hr transpacific flight.. but not that big a deal since case can be charged by USB and most long haul now have USB ports even in economy.

I charged it last night right out of the box.  Used it a little bit just before bed time.  This morning, it was charged to 80% just before my morning workout.  2 hours later, it was complaining that it needed to be recharged.

#2.  I've tried using it on 2 conference calls and a regular call.  Each time people complained that I could not be heard or that I was going in and out.

Wireless Earbuds That Work Well!,"I bought these a while back and so far so good.  I did tons of research looking at reviews from different sources and settled on these.  I like that these don't look crazy in my ears (like Frankenstein with bolts sticking out).  It has plenty of bass and enough highs to balance everything out.  I have run with these and lifted weights and there have been no issues with them falling out.  I haven't run in the rain to test out their waterproof capabilities but based on everything else that works well, I'd imagine it wouldn't be an issue.  Customer support after buying these has been great and checking in on me.  No issues with these earbuds and I am loving these so far!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Item was a let down, but seller was outstanding","I really wanted to like these earbuds, and at first I did. But I’ve tried various different sizes of the rubber tips it comes with and I still can’t get them to stay in when doing a workout that requires a lot of jumping and/or moving around, and I’m constantly adjusting them to make sure they’re firmly in place. I’m switching back to my other ones which, although not “true” wireless, at least the ear tips have a small hook that keep them in my ears. Maybe it just the way my ears are shaped but these weren’t for me.

UPDATE:
The seller contacted me after the initial review and wanted to make sure nothing was wrong or defective with the unit. I explained that I thought it was simply a poor design and not suited for intense exercise. They were eager to make things right and offered a different model free of charge. When I declined, they offered a refund on the original item with no need to send them back. Unbelievable customer service. I have no doubt they ultimately wanted an updated, positive review and I am more than happy to do so. Updated to five stars because they refunded my money immediately and were truly interested in make me a satisfied customer one way or another.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great for the price!!!!,"They fit well, and stay in place with whatever you are doing. Haven't had an issue with movement yet. The pairing process can be a bit funky at times, and I have to place them back in the holder on occasion to get them to pair and connect correctly, but only a slight issue and one I am sure happens with whatever earbud you might be using. The sound is ok, kinda heavy on the base, but most people seem to like that when working out which is what I use these for mostly. I don't notice the base nearly as much when I am listening to an audio book though. As far as connection, I have noticed a random dropping of connection for like a split second sometimes. Usually it is because I have moved from my phone or the battery is low.

Absolutely PERFECT!,"Just like my title says, I'd say these are absolutely perfect for my uses. I needed wireless earbuds for yardwork and runs. While certain name brand earbuds would run you $150 or so, a price which would result in me NEVER taking them outside, I figured this pair at 1/3rd the price would be cheap enough not to care about them. MAN WAS I WRONG. While the price may be cheap, the quality is not by any standards! Not only do they fit well, even if my ears tend to be very small and not work with in-ear headphones, but I also found the sound quality to be damn near perfect. After doing a few days worth of yard work, as well as going on a few runs, I've found they stay perfectly snug as well. I even dumped a bottle of water over my head, forgetting they were there, and had no issue. All in all. The product is absolutely wonderful! Very much worth the purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor call reception,"I kept getting told by people I was talking to that my voice was too soft, or sounded far away. I ended up turning off Bluetooth on calls, and I've only had it for a week.

After reading the reviews for the Tozo Earbuds I took the risk and order them. I was not disappointed! These earbuds come with plenty of different sized silicone pieces to fit you perfectly. The sound quality is great and the noise reducing aspect is quite good as well. I have already recommended these earbuds to a few people. Try them out for yourself!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The earbuds are great!,"Edit: I wanted to edit my review because I finally managed to get in contact with a customer service representative who was willing to help me. They shipped out a new pair of earbuds within 24 hours of my email, and they work great!

TLDR: The earbuds are ok, but if you get a faulty pair like I did, their customer support is nightmarishly bad.

I ordered these earbuds so that I could listen to music while I walk. When I received the earbuds and set them up, I noticed that the left ear bud would lose connection at the slightest movement of my head. When I sit perfectly still, I like the earbuds, but that's not very realistic. It seems clear that I received a faulty pair based on all the positive reviews these have.
The biggest issue has been customer support. In 6 business days from emailing them, I have received one, poorly translated email, telling me to try resetting the earbuds (which I have tried many times). It has been 4 days now since I responded to that email, and it seems clear that the company is going to drag their feet. If you buy these earbuds, you are taking a gamble that you are throwing away $50.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Good Heaphones for the Price,Needed something to wear in the hottub while the kids play in the pool so I can drown out their constant need for love and attention and these did the trick brilliantly.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great headset, user preference gives 4 stars","I only gave this product 4 stars for several reasons.  I used this set for phone calling all day long.  I found it cumbersome to end and start calls by pressing the side of the unit.  It fit well and provided several sized ear bud covers, however, it did not meet my needs for the reason I was using it.  I'm guessing if you use them during workouts or other situations where you leave them in and don't accept lots of calls during use - they may work better.  The SOUND WAS GREAT.  If used for music or video's - they would be a great set.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Didn’t last long, but now testing their customer service","Works great out of the box, good sound quality, decent (but not excellent) battery life.
However, after just 4 months of regular use, the right earbud suddenly stopped working, no longer shows a Bluetooth signal, speaks in a different tone of voice. Support department, took many days to answer my emails, but when they did, they have offered to replace the device.

Earbuds stay in ear during workouts & sound great!,"The TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds were my second purchase as I was trying to find a set of Bluetooth earbuds that would stay in place during my workouts. The TOZO T10's worked great, stayed in place and sounded great. They also appear to be resistant to sweat (this caused issues with another model which this one replaced).

Worth the money,"UPDATE AT 30 DAYS: I’m really not a big review writer, but these headphones are definitely worth the price! The noise cancelling aspect is great. I sat on a 3 hour flight with a screaming baby, with the head phones in, no screaming! Wonderful! I now have the wireless charger and it works perfect too, and charges my iPhone. All in all, 30 days in, totally worth the $30.

Good wireless headphones for the price. Worth the buy. Comfortable, like that the case recharged them in between every use even if it’s only a short period of time.

I went on a 3 day trip, charged them before I left and they have still not died. Comfortable to wear and easy to pause your music or show. They connect to your Bluetooth as a pair or each individually which is great for me.

ONLY reason I didn’t give 5 star rating, don’t expect to use them for a phone call, the mic is very low and people on the other end of the call have a hard time hearing you. By for headphones alone, great buy!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Battery lasts a very long time!,"I wanted to give it a few weeks before writing a review but I will say I am very happy with these headphones. The battery life is amazing. They fit perfectly in my ears and I have had trouble with other ear buds. I had to switch out to one of the different sizes, but now they fit great.  I spent the extra $5 on the extended warranty if anything happens to them, but so far so good. For the price, you can't go wrong with these ear buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I've never owned a pair of wireless earbuds (had to get rid of wires because my cat chewed through three of my other wired earbuds) so this is my first foray into that jungle but so far I'm completely satisfied. Also, the charging case is definitely one of the major highlights for this product.

Great sound,Using both ear buds when you are alone and do not need to be tuned to anything around you as these are quiet and great sound for music.  It is convenient to use with one in your right ear to hear others and still hear your phone music or phone calls too.  I haven't used them much on the phone.  Mostly for music listening.

Amazing convenience,"Product is great. The charging is easy. They cancel out almost all noise around as well. For example, I can mow my lawn and still hear the pod cast I am listening too. I also wear them daily while running.  Most importantly, they stand by their product.

Greatness arrives in these headphones.,These headphones are a ridiculous deal. After unboxing I took them out of the case and my phone found them very quickly. I swapped out the rubber enclosure with a larger one and they instant became noise cancelling headphones. They have not fallen out of my ears and I love the way they sound. The driver pumps out more than enough bass for your music. The call sound is great and very clear. Great work on these bad boys.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Junk - dont waste your $$$$,I gave these a fair shot and if you keep your phone in your pocket and thing you can use these like a normal person think again - the quality is so bad it is useless. The phone call is choppy and is like you have poor service.  You have to hold the phone closer to the earbuds - well then whats the point - just hold the phone.

Awesome quality and sound for the $. Good AirPod alternative.,"Bought these for my daughter as an “AirPod” alternative. She absolutely loves them! A couple cool things to note.

Great for gym workouts,"I purchased these headphone because my Beats just stopped working and I had difficulty with customer service so I said forget it. I have had the TOZO wireless earbuds for over a week now. I can say that they provide great sound quality during my gym workouts and while I'm hiking on trails and cycling throughout the city to work. I am a heavy sweater when it comes to working out but I have had no issue with sweat getting in my ears and shifting the buds while I run. The earbuds stay in place. They are inconspicuous, which I LOVE. They can be used separately. They fit snuggly in my ears so I dont worry about them slipping out. I do participate in water sports and a few extreme sports but I'm not sure if these would hold up well while I'm in action. I'll come back in a few weeks to update those that want to know how they hold up while doing water activities such as rafting and canoeing. So far I am happy with the earbuds during my regular daily activities.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Sounds great but battery last life need to be longer.,"The headphones sound really great when compared to other headphones in the same price bracket( enough bass and great acoustic). Although, the battery life sometimes does not even last a full movie. This definitely needs to be improved . The headphones does not support active noise cancellation(ANC), but does a decent job of lower the ambient sound. Also, it takes time for getting use to pressing the multifunction while in ear, as it may hurt in the beginning.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Solid, affordable TWS earbuds","I have had my earbuds for about 4 months now. I am a highly technical person, and I love music, but do not think I would classify myself as an audiophile. I now have 3 different sets of TWS earbuds, and out of the 3, these are my favorites. One thing I did that makes a difference, at least for me, is I replaced the included tips with memory foam ones that I have used on a number of different earbuds over the past few years.

Pros:
Good sound quality
Good bass, especially with replacement tips
Good battery life
Rapid charging
Wireless case charging
Solid build feel
Good customer service

Cons
Stiff buttons
Intermittent connection loss

Sound/Bass:
These sound as good as any other headphones I have used over the past 5 years or so. I do not spend the money for high-end brands like Bose or Beats, so I can't really compare these to them. I was able to hear a full range of frequencies and there was good clarity. With replacement memory foam tips, the noise isolation is good enough to block out 75% or more of my 20-year old lawnmower's engine.

Battery Life
I have researched and used enough of these to realize that I am not going to go 9-20 hours without having to change the buds. That said, even at high volume levels, the battery life on the buds exceeds what I expected. I can get from 2.5-3 hours on full volume, usually, and longer if I am not playing music/audio books the entire time. They charge pretty quickly in the case too, which means minimal downtime if you need to charge them up. I particularly love the wireless charging for the case. At night, I can just drop it on a charging pad next to bed, and well before morning, the case and buds are at full charge. Between the buds and the case, I am able to go all day without having to recharge the case.

Build
The buds and the case have a solid feel to them and have held up well. The case, in particular, is solid and has survived my pants pocket and laptop bag admirably. Another brand that I purchased, the cover broke off the case within 2 months.

Customer Service
I have had to reach out to TOZO twice about my buds. The first time, was due to intermittent loss of connection, the second, when my right earbud died. I received responses in a reasonable amount of time (usually, overnight), and there was no hassle dealing with them.

Stiff Buttons
I find the buttons are a bit stiff on the buds, and when I press them, I sometimes feel like I am forcing the bud deeper/too deep into my ear canal. It is not a huge issue, but if you push at the wrong angle, it can be a little uncomfortable.

Intermittent Connectivity
This is probably the only, and biggest, issue I encountered. All TWS buds that I have encountered, and even bluetooth headphones such as the Leophile Eel and LG Tone (any version) can lose connectivity. What I found is that there are a couple of places where the buds regularly get disrupted for some reason. I realize it must be the concentration of wireless/bluetooth signal, but it is inconvenient. It has never reached a point where I felt I needed to go out and buy a different pair to resolve the issue.

My other TWS earbuds are the Enacfire E19 and Enacfire E20. As much as I like the E19, these are just enough better for me to move them to the ""backup"" set. I just got the E20, and the shape/size of them is odd enough that I am not sure that I can enjoy them. Compared to either, the TOZO buds win.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nearly-perfect wireless headphones,"Overall, this is a very good quality product and I would definitely recommend it, especially for the gym!

Pros:
1) The charging is easy and convenient! The box is pleasant to hold and easy to carry with you.
2) The interface is pretty intuitive and it does not take much time to figure out how to use this product.
3) The battery life is wonderful, for me, it lasts for 2-4 days.
4) The design is very well thought of.
5) I absolutely love that they don't cause any discomfort for the ears.

Cons:
1) The sound quality is mostly good, but sometimes drops, but then reappears again. It might be related to the qiality of the Bluetooth connection.
2) Switching the connection from one device to another (eg, phone to laptop) might be a bit annoying.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buyer Beware!,"The product that I received looked nothing like what was in the images on Amazon!  The box was a cheap cardboard with a label on the side indicating the name and serial number.

I didn’t have high expectations but I didn’t want to spend a lot on another “flagship” item yet again....  so I took the plunge and tried these out.  They exceed my expectations and the sound is GREAT!.  Noise cancellation was key for me as well and these do a good job as long as you have the right size buds in.  Try all sizes to assure the best fit.  Also LOVE the battery life!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Headphone but a little big,"Updated: these units are highly frustrating. When I use then for voice calls the person on the other end isn't able to understand me. Also if I am slightly active they cut in an out to the point that at times I can barely understand what is being communicated over them whether it is music over Pandora or listening to a podcast. I have had to fall back to my Bluetooth receiver and headphones. Boo!

These are a good set of headphones with nice battery life. That quality of sound is pretty good though a little on the brass side not quite enough bass. They are big and don't quite fit comfortably into my ear so I can't wear them for extended lengths of time. Also I using one (1) headphone is irritating, when I remove the right one from it's base it connects fine but if I don't take out the left one as well I get this constant beep in the right one, would be nice as I am sometimes in areas that I need to be able to hear in one ear. It would be nice if they had an app I could install on my phone to see battery life and maybe other controls. I like the ability to charge on a Qi wireless charger so I don't have to fumble for a chord all the time and the headphones charge quite quickly too. They stay in the ear well and I haven't had one fall out yet. Voice seems to be clear as my wife didn't seem to notice when I was wearing them and talking to her or talking on my LG G6.

Over all decent sound for the price with decent battery, a little big for my ears, would like an app and the ability to only use one ear piece at times.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredibly happy with these earbuds!,"I'm immensely pleased with this purchase. I've had trouble in the past finding earbuds that were comfortable in my ears (especially anything Apple-made). These earbuds are comfortable and snug, and it includes different-sized heads to ensure you find a right fit.

Given the price compared to the features included in this product, I was worried there would be obvious sacrifices in audio quality. Nope! I'm no audiophile, but the sound is crisp. I've previously bought cheaper wireless headphones on Amazon in the $20 range, and there's a world of difference between these high-quality speakers and some of the cheaper options out there.

I was I was in for a nice surprise when I realized that the case supports wireless charging. I lazily skimmed the product listing before purchase, so I assumed the charging case wireless charged the earbuds and thought ""cool, whatever."" But it's much better than that: the case itself can be placed on a wireless charging pad, which charges the case and the headphones. Neat! It works great with my Samsung wireless charger, and I'm about to purchase a Galaxy S10 phone which advertises that it can wirelessly charge *other* devices, so I'm optimistic that I'll be able to charge these headphones from my cell phone in a pinch!

Another worry I had was that I've owned products that charge using magnetism to pull exposed contacts together, and sometimes you have to line it up *just* right to make contact and start charging. Not a problem with these earbuds! Each headphone is pulled snugly into its slot with a satisfying ""click"", and I've had a true 100% success rate with the metal contacts making a connection.

The carrying case is a bit bulky, but it includes a built-in 600 mAh battery (along with the wireless charging hardware) which has to go somewhere. Can't complain on this front.

How's the battery life? Not sure. I have yet to push the limits of my battery since it's simply so convenient to charge these. I largely just use these for 1 hour or less and then return them to the case. No problems on that front.

Each earbud has a tactile button that can long-press to power off, or short-press to play/pause on the connected device. I do wish the media control could've been taken a short step further (skipping to the next song is the main use I have in mind, and volume control would be great). Oh, and double-clicking a button will redial the last called number. This is probably something I will literally never want to do, so it seems like an accidental call waiting to happen. Luckily the buttons have some nice tactile resistance, so it seems unlikely that I'll accidentally double-click.

Finally, the pairing process is as easy as I could ask for. The state of the pairing process is announced in clear, plain English over the earbuds as things get connected (instead of forcing you to rely on obscure patterns of flashing light like some other devices I've used).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Fantastic sound quality. Crystal clear highs and pumping deep base,"These are my second pair of wireless earbuds and I couldn't be happier. I was initially drawn to the TOZO brand due to  offering IPX8 waterproof. That is great, but the quality of the sound and power output is fantastic. I have a large lawn and I love to listen to music while mowing. These are able to cancel out the mower noise without barely exceeding half volume. I also use them while on the bus commuting back and forth to work and love them. I highly recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound.  Comfortable . Sleek and feels built with quality,"So I was a little skeptical about making a purchase  for ear buds like these only because I know my self and it's only a matter of time I misplace one taking them out on the fly or one falls out do to my clumsy nature with that I would rate myself 3 stars .  But back on track here.
I've only used them for about 5 days and am quite the  sound snob when it comes to listening to music.  Ive had a pair of blue tooth headphones before but they were true wireless the bud style was similar but a tiny core wrapped around your neck . So for starters

I love the true wireless set up which I know is pretty standard now  a days . But its great.

The sound quality is far superior then any ear buds I've ever used at max volume the sound and bass is consistent where with some especially lower end ones the sound starts to get a little distorted or the clarity  gets lost.

I had to adjust the size on the one bud but the comfort level it's great and they lock one pretty well . I did a motion test .ex.  jumping up and down, moving around quickly, power walking etc.

The case is compact and sleek with led indicators to tell you the battery life and also comes with a lanyard which is great for  someone like me. Makes it easier to track down if it decides to grow legs and walk away .

I was a little confused on pairing with my phone the only picked up 1 bud. But just some quick thinking that my device reads it as 2 sound outputs  so I had to go to my bluetooth settings and enable left ear speaker and right ear speaker. (Something  to keep in mind)  my phone  galaxy S10+ .  ..  also your phone at least mine tells me the battery life of each ear bud in the bluetooth menu.

I'm 32 and yes even tho most electronics say water proof ir resistant.  Im still semi old school and dont dare to risk it. But built by the quality of these buds sound and crafting I'm sure it is true to its name . But I'm not willing to test it.

So I left them on(purposely) and they do last about the time they claim can't give you exact I was sleeping when they finally died.

I've only used or examined those core features so that's all the idea of the product I can give.  I. Would recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These Will Drive You Insane,"These headphones are not worth the money. The sound and fit were very good but the bluetooth signal is so weak and unstable that if you move your head, cover one of the earbuds or even chew with them in, they cut out. Doing anything physical in them is impossible. Unlike lower priced models, they cannot operate with just a single bud in. They must both be connected, otherwise the left earbud beeps constantly, like a bird sadly calling out for its lost brother. I bought these on a recommendation of a coworker, who has since experienced the exact same issues. They just aren’t very good.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not gonna get a 5 star review because you asked for a 5 star review,"I have never written a review for a free product. This company wanted to send me a ""wireless"" charger if I said the headphones ""had the best bass"", ""good build material"", etc.

After I bought the headphones, I looked at the reviews and half of them were falsely sounding.

Here's a genuine review:

The headphones work and that's a plus.
They stick out of my ear canal so it looks like I have two plastic cylinders protruding out of my ears.
Sound quality is just ok. I have Airpods and they almost comparable not ""exceptional"" like some of these reviews state.
The headphones lack mid and treble so when you listen to a song, it sounds muffled a bit.
Charging is fast and the headphones hold a charge for about 2 hours.

Sound quality is lacking.,"Pros:
Seem to be put together well, and they fit in the ear nicely. The case is good, although the ear buds don't fit quite as easily as they should. So far it's charged my earbuds about 4 times without requiring recharge. I like that they both have power switches. They're light in your ears and hold very well, I wouldn't want to jog with them but they'll be good for most other activities. They do fine watching videos, there's no noticeable ""lip lag"" on my phone or my TV.

Cons:
You'll notice the tinny, thready, bass-less sound right away. Pretty bad, honestly; not $5 earbud bad but maybe $10 earbud bad. The power buttons are plastic membrane type, they'll wear through quickly. No noise cancellation. They last about 3 hours between charges.

Overall:
For $50 I expected better sound. Otherwise minor niggles. If I'd paid $25-30 I'd be happier but I'd still give them away.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unfortunate.,Dang.. I wanted to love these headphones! The sound (when they work) is awesome. I bought my first pair then the right earbud stopped charging and wouldn't turn on.

Great Earbuds,"I'm very happy with the sound and quality of the earbuds. The case is nice and keeps charging the earbuds when it's unplugged. I like the indicator lights so I know when to charge the case. I tried cheaper buds, and they were not good at all. These are very reasonably priced and the sound is excellent! Nice bass (just enough for me). Great highs and mids. They pair up quickly and easily.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than standard apple headphones (and most other headphones I’ve used),"First and foremost, I really don’t like using ear buds as it makes my ears hurt, and it tends to fall out especially during workouts HOWEVER, these are the most comfortable headphones I’ve used (next to apple’s), and it does not fall out what so ever. Sometimes it feels like it’s not even there, but it’s secure and snug. Additionally, the sound quality is amazing. I can hear a wide range of sounds, crisp, clean, snappy, and the bass is phenomenal (without it sounding overbearing). Highly recommend this product. The noise canceling is really good as well, sometimes I can’t hear the person next to me even with a low volume of music.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Decent, but won't stay in ears well.","CONS:  I would be giving these earbuds five stars if it wasn't for the fact that they frequently slip out of my ear when I am working out. The product says you can use them while swimming, yard work, etc, but I would not trust the earbuds doing something like that. Would never wear them out somewhere where it would be hard to find it if it fell out. I am even using the smallest buds it came with. The medium size won't fit me. For the price I spent on these, I honestly had higher expectations for the fit. And because of this lack of fit, the noise cancellation is pointless. Sound quality is good until it starts slipping out.
The phone call feature is basically crap. Tried it out, the other person couldnt hear me at all.

PROS: connection to phone is easy. Battery life is good. Sound overall is good, if it wasnt for the lack of proper fit into my ears.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect Bluetooth pairing,"Great product! I had another brand of wireless headphones in the past and lost the master headphone but still had the slave, making them completely useless. I love that this set I can use either just one or both together. And I was really surprised at how great the range is! I can set my phone down and walk all over my house, even up stairs and still be paired. The price can't be best for the quality. I loved the different sized ear bud pieces to find my right fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very affordable,"I love the buds, not as expensive as the Airpods I have purchased already. These Tozo10 earbuds fit inside your ear canal and doesn't move unless you take them out. You will have to discover which size silicone cover best fits you. The price was definitely on point. Everything in the photos are included plus you are offered a free year's warranty, within 14 days of purchase not to mention there's a 3 year warranty offered for about $6.00 (optional). I noticed that there's a beep for a few minutes but it does stop. The charge is within 20-30 minutes, only a USB cord is included all you need is a block for the socket. There's a string just incase you may lose or misplace the charger box. Please remember the right bud is the main source, you don't have to use both at the same time, but you will need to use the right one.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WOW!,"I am 69 years old and I was clueless on how to pair the earbuds to anything.  So I went looking for a young person at our local restaurant, and sure enough in walks two young people.  I asked him if he knew how to pair bluetooth earbuds and he said that he did.  I was so excited about finding someone to help me, that I paid him for his services.  Such a nice young man!  I can now listed to my echo while my husband watches tv without him complaining my music is too loud.
Life is good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Affordable and Convienient,"This Product works incredibly well and has amazing bass quality. The sound quality is terrific also, you can hear the clarity in each instrument. The earbuds last about as long as advertised (3.5 hours a charge) and the charging case they come with holds four individual charges for the earbuds so you'll have music all day. The waterproof feature works incredibly well and I've yet to have an issue with it in over 2 months of use. Very reliable product, would reccomend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the price!!,"First off my fault for not looking at the battery life.  But barely 5 hrs and I didnt even play anything for some of that time.

Then same issues as the other 1 star people.  Left ear cuts out, bluetooth cuts out constantly.  Its cuts out constantly if there is a little wind or if it's in your pocket.  Haven't tried to swim yet but the bluetooth is so weak I doubt that will work at all.  And no volume control!

The only star it earned was because the sound quality was good at least.

WAY OVER PRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo T10 great product great price.,"On February 16, I received two pairs of headphones, one pair for me and one for my wife. After almost a month of use, I can affirm that the product is wonderful, that the sound is to our liking, for which we are happy with the purchase.

El 16 de febrero recibi dos pares de audifonos, un par par a mi y otro para mi esposa. Luego de casi un mes de uso, puedo afirmar que el producto es maravilloso, que el sonido esta a nuestro gusto, por lo cual estamos contentos con la compra.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
GREAT for first time wireless headphones user!,"Love the sound quality these produce.  Super easy to use and link to device.  After reading other reviews, I did learn about the other sized ear bud adapters that are included in the package.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good for talking on the phone,These connect to my phone easily and reliably. The water resistance is great. But talking on them doesn’t work well - literally every person I’ve talked to over the phone while using these tells me it sounds like I’m in a wind tunnel or drowning in plastic trash bags... really kills the “cool” factor of these for me,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound - left ear but was cutting in and out,"I suffer from tinnitus and after riding my motorcycle on the highway for any great distance my tinnitus goes into overdrive after the ride and makes life miserable. I recently purchased these to use while riding my motorcycle on the highway. Went on my first road trip today.

The Pros: There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). Real easy to pair the ear buds with your phone or iPod. The sound on these is incredible! I didn't have to crank the volume for good quality sound while riding.

The Cons: The medium ear pieces fit and felt the best, but overall the earpieces feel large and I did not have that sense of security that the ear buds were secure in my ear. Later on in the ride, the left earbud would cut in and out when I was turning my head. It did not loose it Bluetooth connection like other reviews. just seemed to cut out for an instant. I have read in another review about a similar occurrence and the individual did a reset and that seemed to resolve the issue.

I HAVE NOT TRIED THE PHONE FEATURE. I doubt anyone would be able to hear, or understand me, if I tried taking a call while riding anyway. Not with the half helmet I wear most of the time.

Overall, four stars (for now, and subject to change). I will do the reset and get out for another ride before the warranty expires and see how they do. If that left earbud continues to cut out... I will send them back.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good pair of blue tooth earbuds,"These are very comfortable and fit in my ears well.  I walk often with them and they have never fallen out.  Sound is excellent on the few times I have used them for music (usually listen to podcasts or mp3 books).  Even wore them in the shower once to see how they stood up, and had no issues at all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product but not for me,I bought this to use on my TV.  I could not get the buds to connect.  I went into Best Buy since it was right by Kohl’s. They told me you needed special buds that they sold in the TV section.  Before I returned them I tried to connect to my iPhone.  No problems at all. Great sound.  But I already had apple buds for my iPhone and only wanted these for the TV.  I was sorry for had to return them but I couldn’t use them.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbuds!,"The TOZO T10 earbuds work really well. The sound quality is really crisp (I mostly listen to podcasts, however) but it is at least as good as any corded earbuds. The convenience and ease of use of these earbuds is over the top wonderful though. They charge when in the case, so it easy to charge when you're not using them. They seem to hold a great charge, as I use them for hours at a time. They stay in my ears securely - yet are very comfortable. They look great and have many other great features! I would recommend (and plan on ordering a second set for my girlfriend.)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Pretty solid earbuds.,"I got these about a week ago. I used them at work, and at the gym. Got to say they are pretty nice! Good, loud sound. They actually fit into my ear, and don't fall out or become loose. Customer service has been awesome. I love that they come in a rechargeable case. I had other earbuds where the only way to charge them was with a USB stick they came with. I had to keep buying multiple earbuds, because the USB stick would break on me. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. Definitely worth $50.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You wont be disappointed.,I love these units. They are very comfortable to wear and last hours on a charge. The sound is amazing. I use them every day(have had them several months) and the battery doesn't seem to lose any charge time.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very satisfied - Great value,"These earbuds are perfect for workouts. The fit is great and they withstand the heavy perspiration that goes with running and cycling. In the past I've had trouble with expensive, high-end earbuds shorting out due to faulty moisture wicking capabilities. I am pleased to report the TOZO earbuds do not have that problem. They are also as easy to pair as the product description claims. Just take them out of the case and they automatically pair with your device. Since they are so reasonably priced, I'll probably buy a second pair to have one in my car and one in my gym bag.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound but sometimes it loses connection,"The sound is really nice and, even though it's not active noise cancellation, it does a pretty good job.
However, sometimes, when I tilt my head a certain way, they lose connection for a fraction of a second.
Also, there's no way to control anything other than play/pause.
Other than that, I love these earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A STEAL FOR 50! BEST PODS IVE USED. CHARGING CASE AND PODS ARE FIRE QUALITY. 10/10,"I was looking for the best earpods in the 50 dollar range and didnt want to buy the Samsung ones for 120 when I can get a pair that 12,000 people have reviewed as amazing. First of all... the charging box is awesome. Theres literally enough battery life in each charge for most my day to day use. And its 4x full charges in the magnetic, solid plastic and well designed case. The magnetic lid that rotates open snaps back when closing with a strong but easily accessible magnet. The earpods themselves are minimal and a.matte black, and has standard size swaps for ear shape/size. They kind of rest back under a part of the ear helping secure or prop it into place. I've yet to have them fall out or even feel iffy (have not ran or worked out with them yet. You can wear them in a pool swimming laps. And I'm hesitant but they have a year warranty. And claims waterproof. The sound is better than the tether wired powerbeats 3, by far... in all aspects including the much needed and lacked by ""beats,"" bass. They knock harder than expected. Not so much as some, but just right. Works great with movie and game surround sound. As a person who never writes reviews but am stoned and HIGHly impressed... forreal. Now I can tune out my talkative can drivers at 5am daily. Buy these. They're what you're looking for. Unless you like trash.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Earbuds for the price, starting on poor customer service","I do truely love the TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds.  The description was spot on.  The only draw back I have found it that my set doesn't come with the different size earbuds, ie the 4 ear piece sizes.  This would make it easier to know which item to purchase for the future.  If you dont have the right fitting earbud YOU WILL LOOSE IT BY IT FALLING OUT.  They have contacted me about an update charging case and replacement earbuds, but seem to be just emailing back & forth Since April 28th.  Will change rating depending on Customer Follow through.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lots of features for such a small item.  Really worth the money!,These things are awesome!  I didn't think I would enjoy them as much as I do.  I used them for working out but also started bringing them to work.  I can just use one at a time so it allows me to listen to my music but still hear and talk with people around me.  Kind of like the normal bluetooth you use with your cell phone but less obvious.  The sound quality is great!  Charges fast and I like the wireless charging.  So you just put the case with the buds on it and it just charges!  Not bad for something that is less than $50!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Nice for the money, but don't expect professional quality","Was sort of disappointed by the sound quality, but they're nice for the money and it's not terrible. They came fully charged and were incredibly easy to set up and pair.

Also came with 4 different size silicone earbud attachments so you don't have to worry about them being too big or small for your ears. Haven't tested the waterproof functionality yet, but hopefully they won't suffer the same fate as my last pair of earbuds when I inevitably drop them into a bucket of mop water on accident.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the purchase,Works good. Switched the rubber for smaller ones included in the packaging. Still have to adjust to keep in my ears when running.  Keeps charge for a long time. Haven't died on me yet.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great value for money product with good quality sound output,"I bought these for fun but the quality of sound was beyond my expectations.

I haven't tested the battery life yet but overall, i am pleased with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I'm really enjoying them so far,"I've only had them for a day now, but I've tried the wireless charging, I wore them in the shower just for fun to check the waterproofing, and obviously I checked how well they stay in my ears. I was very happy with all of it. The noise cancellation is good, the sound quality is good, and it's a great price for the quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Truly Wireless.....Great Sound!,These are the third pair of wireless pods I've had over about ten years (batteries wore out) and I definitely like these the best. Truly wireless. They paired up easily and synced to my iPhone every time I've used them since original setup. The bass is awesome!  The controls for phone answering are much easier to use the the other pods I had.  The fact that they're waterproof is great as I like to listen to music while hot tubbing and the Bluetooth range is good.  Very pleased with my purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Loving it!,"Five stars all the way around! I am loving everything about these earbuds! One of the best features about these is NO CORDS!! I have really long, thick hair and my previous Anker Bluetooth earbuds were good but had the wire connecting them and it was constantly a nuisance getting in the way or tangled in my hair, so its SUPER nice to not have to fight my hair or shirt, etc... with these ear buds. They look nice, the case is great, they are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is fantastic. I can really hear the bass! I like that I can use the ear buds separately as I wear them at work for background music and get a full day out of the batteries by swapping them. I have used them for a couple calls and the person on the other end had no issues hearing me or with background noise so that's a definite win! The noise cancellation is great, maybe too good, even if I pause my music when talking to someone I still sometimes have to take the bud out to be able to hear them properly but not a big deal, it's great to drown everyone else out at the gym. My boyfriend was super impressed with them as well when I let him listen, he guessed they were double the price. I am very happy with this purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than Congress,"You'd think for 50 bucks, they would be as effective as Congress. NOPE, they work magnificent, if they worked any better they would have to change the name to the PERFECT $50 EARBUDS that is better than Congress.  I have paid off a small home loan in all of the ear buds I have purchased over the years, so far they are amazing, 3/4 volume on my phones, and I cannot hear anything but my playlist. I dont even hear the dentist drilling my teeth. (TRUE) After 3 needles full of Novocaine I didnt feel it either. I now have badass earbuds and fixed teeth.
PRO: affordable, easy connecting to blue tooth. they stay in my head whilst Im lifting weights, rowing, getting drilled
CON: would be cool for an APP/ equalizer sound control (bass-mids, trebel)

Now let me tell you why I picked them. I wanted to try RAYCON, but what I wanted was sold out. I checked on Amazon, and I only look at 4+ stars and this one came up, with 10 billion reviews, - Im like well SHIZFIRE. 10 trillion people either like them or its a conspiracy and the Russains hacked Amazon and it all a bunch of lies.
So I took a chance, (so you dont have to) and Im glad I did, whether or not it is a hack job, I got a darn good pair of working earbuds, I look hip, i feel hip.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds,"These earbuds are some of the most comfortable that I have ever tried.  They have excellent sound quality.  I wear these at work and am able to focus while listening to my music.  I love the case with the wireless charging.  Since most devices are wireless charged now, I take them home and charge them each night.  Even talking on the phone with them is great.  Everyone is able to hear me clearly and I can hear them without having to mess with another headset.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality at bargain prices,"I bought these under my wife's account, so I can't show up here as a verified purchaser, but rest assured, I bought these headphones here on Amazon last week, and have been using them for about 7 days now.

About a year ago, I bought a pair of Zolo Liberty wireless earbuds for over twice the price of these, and had nothing but problems. The earpieces would often fall out of sync, and would lose connection with the phone in my pocket. These are much better, plus waterproof, and I greatly enjoy the fact that I can drop them on my wireless charging pads and come back to full batteries. The sound still cuts out every once in a while, but it very quickly improves, and I am not bothered by it when I'm listening to music or podcasts walking around in crowded areas. The sound quality and comfort of these earbuds is at least as good as that more expensive pair, but I lost those for a direct comparison.

(I am writing this review because the company sent me a request to post a review with the promise of sending me a free wireless power bank, but the words are true, and I am glad to try to convince others to buy this pair of headphones instead of wasting their money on a more expensive brand name.)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are excellent,"I’ve been looking for something with a good bass kick for a long time and finally here it is. These are really great for the cost. Small and not bulky like the rest of the stuff on the market. And seriously light.

Sound quality is really good.
Battery will last about 4-5 hours which is pretty good their size.

Very easy to pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great noise cancelling and bass!,The design of the earbuds and case feel quite sturdy and thus far have worked flawlessly. The noise cancelling is quite good as well and I am fond of the bass levels too. All in all I'm pleased and based on what I've found so far I would definitely recommend to a friend!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the purchase price.,"I like these headphones, fit is crucial and these do fit good with the default rubber earpiece. This of course is subjective. I did see one other reviewer noted these didn't seem very loud. I agree with that as well. But again subjective. Overall pretty happy with them. I would recommend them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are junk!,"These had great reviews so I got two pair. Both are total junk. The battery life is a joke. With the case I have to recharge it weekly. My old treblab800 lasted this long on the internal battery with no charging case.
The leads that connect the the ear buds in the case that charge them are to short and allow the ear buds to turn on and connect to your phone at random. I had to sand the area on the ear bud where the leads connect to allow them to make solid contact. The plastic in this area is to thick. Another design flaw!
Connectivity is a joke. I can put my phone in my left pocket and loose reception and get it back by moving the phone to my right pocket. I can’t walk more than 10 feet from my device without loosing connection.
The left ear but on one set won’t stay in place and the right one with the other set won’t stay in place. No option to control volume or skip? Man $8 ear buds have this ability. Also the wireless charging does not work on one set and sometimes does not work on the other.

These are total junk and not worth the wasted money. Go with treblab for cheap sports ear buds and be very happy.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid buy. Get these.,"I'll admit that I initially didn't have very high expectations of these, I've been burned many times by earbuds that claimed to be great and even had decent reviews. Thankfully, these were NOTHING like any other earbuds that I have tried.
First, the fit. They are actually very comfortable. They come with 4 different size ear pieces. I personally have to use two different sizes because my ears are odd, but they stay in place perfectly. Most of the time, I forget that I have one in.
That leads me to the sound. The sound quality blows away literally every other set of earbuds that I have ever owned, hell, they blow away every set of headphones that I have ever owned without a doubt in my mind. These things are on par with the audio system in my car (4x Kicker 6x8s, old enough to not remember the model, 1x Rockford Fosgate 15"" subwoofer, powered by a 1000w Kenwood amplifier, and driven by a 200w Kenwood head unit). I CANNOT recommend these enough
The call quality on these is awesome as well, most of the Bluetooth headsets that I have used over the years have had problems with either picking up too much ambient noise, or just generally being too quiet for the other party to hear, but these are loud and clear, and don't pick up much of the ambient noise at all.
Finally, for battery life. I haven't run them long enough for them to go dead yet, but I can definitely say that they will last you a few good hours of steady use.
The case is a little bulky, but not completely unmanageable for men's pockets. Women, you'll want to stash this thing in your purse
The wireless charging works pretty well with my cheap 3-year-old wireless charging pad, and the buds themselves charge up pretty quickly too.
Overall, a very solid buy, and very happy with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earbuds for price/value,"I love wearing headphones when listening to music so I got a pair of these so I can go cordless when walking around and trying to be active.  These earbuds are perfect, they synced to my phone and gear S3 watch without any problems. I love the case they came in and how I can use it with a wireless charger if I want. Plus the case they came with has a built in battery to always top off the ear buds in case you need it.

It was everything I asked for and I'm very pleased with them. Didn't have to spend hundreds on them for a superior product.

Bass was powerful too!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for driving or traveling,"The fit and function of the earbuds are good.  With different size cushions you can custom fit to your specific needs.  Sound quality is good, but lacks a bit of bass punch in my opinion.  I travel a lot and use them for listening to audio books and music.
Touch controls are simple (pause/play, on/off and answer call), but effective.  I've tried earbuds with sensitive touch response, and was accidentally pausing, fast forwarding or some other function when I reached up to adjust the earbud in my ear.  Pairing with my phone was very simple.
The holder/charger protects well and is easy to carry in backpack or pocket.  Recharge of the earbuds and charger are quick.
I liked these so much that when I lost my original pair (left them in a airplane seat pocket) I ordered a replacement set right away.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Earbuds,"After trying many different brands, which were a disappointment  I purchased the TOZO T10 Wireless 5.0 Earbuds and am very happy with them. They are comfortable and the sound so clear, something that not all earbuds have. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends. My search is over!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Thank you,"It really deserve five stars eventhough for some reason it doesn't stay on my right side ear and also I wish it come with bluetooth connector b/c I am gonna buy connector for my laptop, It is very quality product and 100% waterproof.  Thank you so much",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Average Quality, Below Average Comfort","These earbuds were very uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time (30+ mins). The sound was average quality at best, very treble-heavy. The instructions were broken English and sketchy.

Anyway. I was disappointed with the purchase and instead returned the item. I'll spend an extra $20 and get a brand name pair that I can rely on.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You can't get better for triple the price.,"Okay so I just got these in a few minutes ago... I charged them for a little bit and then took them out. They immediately paired with each other and said ""pairing"". I selected Tozo-T-10 on my phone. Again, they paired immediately. I put them in my ears. I put on the song ""Vivir Mi Vida"" by Marc Anthony. I then proceeded to pick my jaw up from the floor. I am blown away. The sound quality on these earbuds is beyond belief. For the price, you CANNOT GET BETTER. I am a musician and a DJ, and I know music. These are phenomenal. The bass is nothing short of intense. The mids are clear. The highs are crisp. Oh, and by the way, I'm writing this review in the shower. My Note 9 is waterproof too. Did I mention they're waterproof?

These are nothing short of perfection for every category under $200. Absolutely incredible. I'm quite impressed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the Money,I like the fit of each bud.  I was skeptical at 1st if they would stay put while working or playing.  They do. I didn't have to change out the rubber ear pieces .  The ones on the buds fit just right.  The bass is amazing but the treble is a little weak.  The battery life so far has been about 3 hrs between charges on the base unit.  That is less than my old wireless jlab set that would go 5+ hours.  Maybe these will get better.  Noise cancellation is extremely good.  I can't hear my work hand held radio and have actually missed calls addressed to me because of the cancellation.  I have to loosen them in my ears just so I won't miss any more radio calls.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect in every way,"My main concern when buying earbuds was the sound quality coming from my side during a call. With these earbuds, I have no issues whatsoever with sound quality both incoming and outgoing. When listening to music the experience is amazing, and the noise cancellation is flawless. Additionally, the ability to pair one earbud to one device while pairing the other to a separate device can be incredibly helpful.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Broken Out of the Box,"Thank goodness the warranty card is the first thing you see when opening the box, because you’re probably going to need it.

Like many others, the left earbud kept cutting in and out sporadically. Attempted hard resets and unsynching from my phone, but still the problem persisted. With the thousands of good reviews, I feel Tozo has to have poor quality control with this product. Will be returning for a refund.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WOW these are good!,"I bought a different set of wireless earbuds: the sound quality was pretty bad and after 5 weeks they stopped pairing together and became individual devices, so you couldn't listen to music. Successfully negotiated a return (THANKS AMAZON SUPPORT!), and decided to take another chance. BOY am I glad I did!

Sound. I wasn't expecting much, because wireless, but I was wrong. Great bass, good overall sound, and you can pause music with a touch.

Connection. They have a good manual which details exactly how to connect them, and what to look for both on the buds and in your Bluetooth list. Worked great every time.

Fit. The other ones I got had a weird protuberance and shape that made them fit weird, and they stuck way out. These are GREAT. Multiple ear canal adapters, so whatever size your ear, they'll fit snug. They also don't stick out too far, and are very comfortable.

The only minor issue is that having volume and skip controls on the buds would be cool. But otherwise these are excellent earbuds for a good price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall good quality but will not stay put in my ears,"These seem pretty high quality overall, and I really wish these worked for me, but they absolutely will not stay in place no matter which size tips I use which makes these utterly useless for me.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Solid Bluetooth earbuds for the price (2nd pair I’ve owned),"This is the second pair of wireless earbuds I’ve owned. I’m not in any way an audiophile, but the sound quality on these definitely blows the Enacfire ones out of the water. Also, so far I haven’t experienced the same issue of my body interfering with the signal when my phone is in my pocket. The build also feels sturdy. I haven’t tested them out in the water but from close examination they seem pretty solidly sealed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great product,This product is absolutely amazing in terms of both sound quality and battery life.  On one charge of the case with the headphones inside my headphones will last me around two weeks with me using them at least an hour a day.  Not only that but the sound quality is great with deep bass and clear sound. I have yet to try them out in any wet conditions so I can't speak for that feature but I am impressed with the quality these offer.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buy! You won’t regret it!,"Great product, I was skeptical and I am very picky when I choose headphones, but I thought why not and gave it a shot.

Never automatically connects to my phone,"These work fine overall, sound better than the TaoTronics equivalent and quickly connect with each other 3-4 times you take them out of the box. The 4th time you might have to put them back in and take them out once or twice, but then they usually connect to each other again. The primary challenge I'm experiencing is that even though they are paired with my phone, they cannot connect to it automatically when I take them out of the box. Each time I want to use them I have to go to the settings on my phone and select the TOZO option from my paired bluetooth list.
These are the only bluetooth device I've ever own that requires this extra step. Consequently, I can never just pop them into your ears and start listening. Every time I want to use them I have to take that extra step. Ultimately, I use the TaoTronics version more often because they don't have this issue, nor did any of the other 20+ bluetooth headphones I've owned over the years. Of coure the TaoTronics version has it's own severe problems because they often can't connect to each other, but that's for another review.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds!!!,I was looking to get a pair of truly wireless earbuds for a while and these caught my eye. The earbuds are really good for the price. You cant really go wrong with them. To be honest I was not expecting the sound quality to be this good. The bass is deep and the high and mids are super clear. They are super easy to use and the ability to just use one ear piece for calls is awesome. I have not faced any connection issues so far. After paring them with my phone they automatically connect to my phone as I pick them up from the case.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Choppy connectivity in both ears,"The headphones feel great and have great noise cancellation however the connectivity drops constantly when you are in motion. The choppy sounds make these headphones unbearable as your music/podcasts keep dropping every second. Sometimes it is just on the left earbud but many times it affects both of these.  This issue seems to be happening to a lot of users. When sitting or laying these headphones are great however what's the point of them if you can't walk, can't imagine how running would be.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buds cut out and loose connection when using during active sports,"Upd.: After few weeks of usage I have some updates. First of all, whatever is said in the original review is still true provided you're sitting behind your desk and do not move around. But after I wrote the original review I took it our for a run. Surprisingly, as soon as I started actively moving, it started cutting out on me every 30-40 seconds. Of course, it is impossible to use them like that. I took them off and finished my run without them. Then I did initial round of troubleshooting, resetting, reconnecting etc. and the second day I took it out but had another buds with me (the kind where two buds are connected with a wire). 15 minutes into my run I stopped and switched to those back ups.
Then I returned these buds and god replacement sent out. Tech support said that it was because ""interference with other electronic devices"". Yeah, right. I'm sitting in the office with tens of electronic devices around me, and they work just fine, but as soon as I get out onto a forest trail, it suddenly sees ""electronic interference""?
So, I was told it might have been a bad device and I agreed to get a replacement.
Got it 5 days ago and was taking out those buds almost every day. Everything was more or less OK (3-5 cut outs in 30min run) but today it started cutting out every 30-40 seconds again. I did some more experimenting and realized the following: Your own body shields these buds from connected device. If you put your connected device somewhere on your lower back on the left side - it completely blocks the signal, as there is lot of flesh and bones between the right bud and your connected device.
If you connect your buds to your smartwatch, as I do, and wear it on your left wrist, then as you run or walk, you'll be moving your arm in and out of area of good connection, causing cut outs. Even if you have some long sleeve closing - it will reduce signal a lot and your buds will start cutting out. And don't blame the connected devices - I tested that with another set of buds, it is the intrinsic problem with this specific model of buds.

As such, these buds are only good in office, where you keep your connected device close to your right bud and do not actively move around. But in the office you can use something more comfortable and with higher sound quality. The whole point of these buds is active sports, they are waterproof and light, so you can take them out for runs, hikes, etc. Unfortunately, they fail miserably in their intended use.

Original review:
I was surprised how comfortable these are and how good the sounds quality is.
I have more expensive (around $180) buds from a well known brand name, and I was quite disappointed with them. The problems were: impossible to get a good fit, buds were falling out all the time, material was causing my ears to itch like crazy, very poor sound quality which depended on how they fit, absent bass and noticable lag.

These buds that are almost three times cheaper, have none of those problems:
Great fit, stay in the ears
Solid bass, no squeaking trebles
Almost undetectable lag, less than 100ms.

Great passive noise cancelling, based on the tiny holes on the buds I suspect that this thing might have some kind of active noise cancelling, but haven't read anything about it and haven't tested it yet.

Another nice touch: wireless charger. I just need to put it on my charging plate, no plug/unplug hassle.

Have yet to see what the battery life is and if it makes my ears itch after long time use.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cannot use just one; charging case does not hold a charge,"Pros:
Light weight, great for runs and work outs.
Seem to be sweat resistant.
Extremely quick charging.
Cons:
Don't come with deep fitting rubber ends, and if you have your own they have to be removed every time you charge.
Cannot use just one at a time, they constantly look for each other.

Excellent Earbuds with a Pumping Bass,"I purchased these earbuds with careful evaluation on the sound quality and bass coverage. And boy I was glad I got these. The sound quality at this price point in my opinion puts the other premium companies/headphones to shame. The bass is really kicking and the design helps eliminate a lot of the ouside noise. When I reported a wierd problem happening with my earphones (sound from the right side earphone got very diminished) to the company's customer service, they immediately got back offering to send a new pair as a replacement. Kudos to a very positive experience overall as I await the replacement.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Earbuds!,These are great earbuds.  They fit comfortably and secure in the ear (which was one of my main concerns) and come with 4 different size buds.

Great headset but after,Great ....update after a few months they are great today aug 13th the only time that i actually drop the case the spring loaded charging pins for the head phone broke off never dropped the case ever since i bought them in April until today my headphones werent even in the case at the time little upset about it also now and then i would have to reconnect them but just turning then off now and then isnt a big problem just care full with the case,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

UPDATE:
Connectivity issue, for some reason, I'm having the left side disconnected every time I'm outside, not a problem when I'm indoors but as soon I get out of the house the earbuds start losing connection especially on the left side,  is very annoying,  Im gonna keep trying them a little more.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great option for complete wireless headphones,"The bluetooth connectivity connects easily with my device, almost too good at cancelling out noise, recharge quickly and I love that the case holds the headphones as well as the magnetic feature to hold them to charge.

Good but may have issues,"So let me start by saying that the earphones are good, when they aren't failing you. The issue these earphones have is the sound. The sound continuously cuts off. It goes a little something like this, the sound is playing and when I apply pressure on a certain part of my phone the audio starts cutting off and when it comes back it comes back in a faded manner. I've had a similar kind of issue with other bluetooth earphones. My second problem is when I was using both earphones, it decided to pause therefore, I set one down in the charging slot, then when I tried using it again I had issues trying to get sound on the earphone that I put away. I imagine what solved it was leaving both in the charging box for a length of time.
Besides all this the sound is good and does a good job of blocking sound from outside sources. I'm thinking of returning though I wouldn't like to deal with the annoying issues any further.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud drops out.,"Everything about these is great except for on major issue. The left earbud (slave) keeps losing signal with the right (master). Kills the listening experience. Tried a factory reset no luck. A shame I have to send them back.

Also, the terms slave and master are not racist as another review implied. They’re audio terms. When one speaker gets a signal from another speaker instead of from the source, it’s consider the slave. The speaker getting source signals is the master.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bang for the Buck quality,"I just unboxed these about a half hour ago. I ordered based on a lot of bang for the buck reviews. So far, I'm very happy with them. The case had a charge in the box, but I charged it up to be sure it was a good charge. The buds charged up in about 20 minutes. Pairing was a cinch, just have your device set for Bluetooth and scan for new items and remove them from the case simultaneously.  They paired up in a snap. Sound quality is even better than I expected for the price I paid. I've gone through several wired bluetooth earbuds,  mainly Skullcandy and Beats. The bass in these Tozos is clear and full. I highly recommend fitting them with the different cups or caps to find the right seal for your ears. It will make a huge difference in sound quality and comfort. I can't give a true rating on battery life yet, but ao far so good. I will be gifting a set to my kids in the future. I'm very happy the overall product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for such a low price...,"These ear buds met expectations as described by other reviewers. The charging case is an added bonus being able to be recharged wirelessly. But ear buds themselves are great. The sound quality is excellent especially with the add low range. The only issue I had was with the selection of ear tips.  I have tiny ear canals so had to purchase smaller tips, but they were inexpensive and allowed a perfect fit. I can move around without the coming loose. I will say that in my case, eating while wearing the buds does cause then to dislodge a bit but they do not fall out. I can highly recommend these buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Mostly Satisfied--Generally speaking,"The sound quality, especially for under $50, is great! The different sized earbuds help keep earbuds in ear. The charge lasts 3 to 4 hours; however, I never timed it. My ear canals are large (I guess?). So, I do have some difficulty keeping the earbuds in place, especially when running or doing ""jumpy"" exercises. For me on exercising with buds, this product is better suited for weightlifting than jumping around a lot.  I also recently cleaned some corrosion (green stuff) that had formed on a connector in the unit's charging box (Q-tip & rubbing alcohol--a 2-minute job). Other than that, I am mostly satisfied with the purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds for a great price!,"I have tried several truly wireless earbuds and these provide the best combination of features.  While i think I could use an in between tip size, they are pretty comfortable and never fall out.  The fact that the case can charge them in my pocket and I can also use just one at a time makes for hours and hours of uninterrupted listening.  I prefer to listen to podcasts or audio books while doing various chores like mowing the grass or cleaning the house or even just taking a trip to the store.  Would definitely recommend.

When using just one earbud, take both out of the case and let them pair, then put one back.  The one you are still listening to will beep that is has lost connection a few times.  I don't honestly know how many times because I decided I was just going to try to deal with it and hours later i realized i wasn't hearing the beeping.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than others,Really like these. I had problems with other similar products where the left channel would constantly drop out. Not these. Great sound quality too.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality for the price,"I wanted, since I own AirPods, to get Beats Pro for better noise isolation when needed but cost and bad reviews on quality prevented that purchase.  I've used these for several weeks now on my morning walk and on balance am very satisfied with my purchase.  Yes, they do sometimes get out of sync with each other but then so do my AirPods, though not as much.  I keep my phone in my right back pocket and if I move my right arm up or down sometimes that will cause the issue and sometimes nothing I do causes any problem.  (Bluetooth is just weird.)  I listen mostly to podcasts and audio books but they are acceptable for music with decent bass with the proper seal.  On that issue, I could not get a proper seal with the included ear tips.  Or if I did they fell out easily.  No problem, I have lots of tips from over the years and found a set that works.  As far as the charge goes, they last through my walk which can be up to 90 minutes.  After two recharges in the case I have to charge the case itself but for my purposes that's not a problem.  I can't speak to how long they'll play without being put back in the case beyond the 90 minutes.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A Very Pleasant Surprise...UPDATE - Maybe Not So Pleasant,"I was somewhat despondent after our puppy chewed my Bose ear buds into a very mangled and unusable versions of their former selves. Since purchasing another pair would be fiscally irresponsible at this stage, I decided to give the TOZO T10s a shot. Figured there was not much to lose at the price.

I will admit to initially being quite impressed with the overall presentation and packaging upon receipt; however, packaging doesn't mean much if the product doesn't deliver. Well, it delivered for me. The one step setup and pairing could not have been easier. Both wired and wireless charging is quick and works well. Battery life is consistently right at 4 hours with my usage. As for the fit, I feel extremely lucky that the T10s fit perfectly for me right out of the box, but it is good to have three other tip options just in case. In fact, I have been in the gym with them and have not felt the need to stop and adjust them as I move around. For my amateur, untrained ear, the sound quality and call quality are well beyond my expectations with noise cancelling and waterproof being nice bonuses.

At this point, I couldn't be happier with the T10s after my first week with them. They definitely give considerable bang for the buck and have me rethinking my views on wireless earbuds in general.

Update - Actually, I find myself very disappointed because in many ways I still feel the same about my previous observations; however, I guess it was too good to last or be true. Connectivity - Over the last couple of days, the left earbud began losing connection once in a while but ultimately it began happening regularly. The right earbud maintains slightly better connection unless it is too far from my Samsung S9, which is apparently the distance from my pocket to my ear...especially if I turn my head away from my phone. I have reset the Bluetooth connection and the connection between the earbuds without success. Rating reduced to 1 star because lack of connectivity in wireless earbuds is kind of a big thing and back to Amazon they will go.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid product with good quality,"I really like this product. It is easy to use and has very good sound quality. Although the IPX8 is kind of a overkill, I wear it all the time during workout and commute. The noise canceling is very good. One thing to point out is since it is inserted to the ear channel and it has very good sealing. There is a “unbreathable” feeling after long hours of usage. Overall, I will give it a solid 5 stars.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Customer Service,"These are my first pair of bluetooth headphones. I mostly got them for going to the gym. They are a lot easier to deal with then regular headphones with cords.  They work really well in the gym setting, didn't have any real problems getting the right fit and them staying in.  I pretty much use them all the time now, not just in the gym setting.

The only gripe was that it only lasted about 4 months before the charge base wouldn't hold a charge, unless I kept it plugged in. (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5)  I'm not sure if I just got a bad one or not.  I ended up emailing TOZO to see about a replacement.  They sent me a new full set (Headphones and Charge base).

Awesome Quality at Great Price,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best earbuds I've ever owned,"I've tried out several Bluetooth earbuds and none of them even compare. I would say this product surpasses the Apple AirPods in every category. I would expect a pair like these to cost easily over $100 yet I got them for a quarter of that. I have let my friends try them out and got 3 of them to order a pair without hesitating. Do yourself a favor and just buy them. You won't be disappointed. If for some reason you don't like them, Tozo has incredible customer service and will gladly reimburse you. Overall 10/10!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

solid,"I only use this to listen to music and podcasts while I'm working or exercising, and have only used it once for making a call. Sound quality is pretty good, and the battery life is fine for what it is. It seems to charge quickly enough from the included charger so I don't wait too long between listening sessions. The only issue I have is that sound will drop off from one of the buds when they are a few feet from each other. Other than that, no complaints. Solid for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Sound, Easy Pairing","The T10 earbuds produce fantastic sound even at low volume.  They fit comfortably right out of the box.  The carrying case acts as a recharger battery when not connected to a power source.

Im impressed!,I was kinda skeptical about ordering these at first but i must say these are impressive for the price very solid and premium feel too them these headphones almost feel like they’re worth $200 excellent sound quality and they provide you with extra ear tips for different ear sizes. They’re magnetic so you don’t have to worry about them falling out of the charging case not to mention it’s pretty convenient that you can charge the case wirelessly too. I must say well worth spending $50 on these. I’ll provide picture updates later on but they even provide you with a one year extended warranty in your package as well free of charge!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than iKanzi IPX7,"These wireless buds have great bass and mids. They fit well in my ear and, of course, come with multiple size ear inserts to get the perfect fit. Most imporantly, they aren't overly sensitive to touching. My previous earbuds, the iKanzi IPX7 wireless waterproof earbuds, would stop playing at the slightest touch (a problem when you are just trying to wipe sweat off your head). And they didn't fit nearly as well. These are excellent.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Company sent me another set free to test. They ended up functioning as expected and sound great. I just think there may be some products defected but I am glad the company was willing to make sure they resolved the issue as best they could.

Like other bad reviews, when I walked around at all the LEFT earbud would cut out for a split second then come back on. It was more annoying than not having any music!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So far so good,"I was a bit doubtful that they would work well on a run.  I am a noob when it comes to using wireless earbuds when working out.  That said, I started off using these on an 8 mile treadmill run and no problem.  Mind you, I was only running 10 min miles but they did not move nor was there movement that caused sound degradation or the like.  I hope they keep up.  I will update if there is any change when I do faster interval training, outside run, gym workouts and the like.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price.  Battery life is meh : 3-3.5 hours.,"I had to read the tiny instructions before I realized that the typical “pair” trigger isn’t initiated with a button press, but rather by sliding the buds into the case for two seconds, and then quickly taking them out - simultaneously.  LOLZ.

Very respectable buds for the price.  Would recommend to family and friends.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Music to my ears,"Needed a pair of earphones to use running as my regular ones constantly came out of my ears. I was wary about these at first. They arrived quickly and in the box are the head phones, charging case, ear pieces to adjust size as needed, USB cord to charge, instructions, 1 yr warranty, and a cord to attach to case for carrying.
Very easy to use. As soon as you take them out of the charging case they pair to each other. If your Bluetooth is on - they will then pair to your phone. Good fit - no issues with falling out at all. Sound quality is great - could even make out bass on songs which sometimes isn't as clear on cheaper headphones. I was able to go a good distance from my phone before they disconnect. If you need to hear something or speaking to someone you will need to take one out even on low volume or off. Charging is easy - stick them back in the case. They will charge up to 4hrs if case is not plugged so great for work. I am very impressed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and fir!!,I am always nervous about Bluetooth headphones. I have had some that had a horrible sound- almost tinny. I have had some that wouldn’t hold a charge. I have had some that couldn’t pair with the 2nd earbud. I am glad to report that these earbuds have great sound! They fit great in my ears which was another concern. So far I love these earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice earbud for the price,"Just receive the product. Really nice Bluetooth earbud for the price point.  It has good sound quality and nice design. Haven't test the water proof yet but I trust it would work. The battery is what I love the most. I used it for 2 hours straight with one charge and it still has juice left after that.

"Good quality, but may have Bluetooth signal conflict.","Very good performance. Sound quality and noise cancellation is as good as expected. Mic sensitivity is a bit weak.
However, it has a bit conflict with my laptop. Whenever it is connected with my laptop, there is always a high-pitch white noise in left earbud. When connected with other devices, e.g. my iphone, no high-pitch white noise. I suspect it is due to signal frequency conflict with my laptop Bluetooth signal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality,"Theses are nothing short of AMAZING! Great deep rich bass, crystal clear TWS synchronization. So easy to pair, just pull them out of the case and they will link right up to the last device used (if in range with bluetooth on).

I have tried many sets of headphones like these, but they always fell out of my ears. The Tozo earbuds on the other hand (once the right ""buds"" were put on) are a very snug fit. I can walk, jump, or even run, and they stay in place.

Not only do the earbuds get 4 wireless charges out of the sturdy travel case, but the case itself charges wirelessly. Simply set it on your wireless charging pad and walk away.

You simply won't find a better pair of wireless earbuds in this price point (double it for that matter).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Budget Friendly Wireless Earbud,"The big selling point on these for me was the volume. Other earbuds in a similar price range just simply weren't loud enough on the volume unless you were using the right bud. With these, I can use either bud independently of the other. Also, the volume on either bud is plenty loud enough even when I'm brushing my teeth with an electric toothbrush. Overall great quality for the price and seems sweat/water resistant and drop resistant. Get a pair of these if you want a good quality bud without paying 2-5 times the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

A Company that truly cares about their products.,"A few months ago, I purchased a TOZO T 10 and in my review mentioned I was less than satisfied with the quality.  Shortly after the posting, I received a package with a new T 10. Since I had not expected anything including a response, I thought it might have been a mistake. Turns out, it was not, when I received an e-mail from TOZO inquiring about the delivery. As promised, I opened the replacement immediately and I was delighted with the outcome.  The “replacement “ TOZO worked better than expected and I am delighted to rescind my original review with one more in line with the product offering. I especially want to thank them for their outreach and efforts in caring about my original disappointment. I highly recommend looking at the T 10 for future purchases.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Left ear keeps disconnecting,Just got these today and I'm overall impressed. The sound quality is much better than I was expecting. It took a bit of getting used to when it came to wearing them as I'm used to headphones but these are amazing. They stay put in my ear and had no trouble connecting and pairing.... at first.

Constantly disconnecting and people can't hear me,I am quite dissapointed as I was looking for something comparable to airpods but not $250. I initially liked these I use them as a headset for work a lot and also to listen to music at the gym. When I have them in for extended periods of time they will just do this wacky beeping and disconnect and reconnect. No clue why. I often talk to people who say they can't hear me so I have to switch to another headset which is a huge pain and when I leave voicemails people call me back and say they couldn't hear a thing I said. I am going to reach out to support and see what they say because they are really not working for me.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Excellent price. Excellent product.,"I've had these for about a week now, and really like them. I previously had wireless, but wired earbuds, and it's amazing how much more comfortable running is without having a wire on your neck. The build and feel of the headphones are great. Sounds is perfectly fine for podcasts/audiobooks. Battery life is a bit of the shorter side ~3h, but since you are conditioned to put them back in the charging case, it stretches the battery life to a more substantial timeframe--I've only had them ask to be recharged once in the countess instances that I wanted to listen.
Will continue tracking longevity, but so far these are excellent and I'd buy them again! Bargain pricing at <$50!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the cost,"I finally needed to get a new pair of bluetooth headphones after my wired around-the-neck ones had too much dropout from the wires being old and used from the extending and retracting process, so I chose these.  The two most important things to me about this choice was the fit and the charging.  I immediately did the ""shake test"" and after making myself dizzy from shaking my head, I was pleased that these were still comfortably secure in my ears.  The second thing was the wireless charging.  I have several wireless charging pads throughout my house and office (call me lazy) and it immediately begins the charge and goes quickly about it.  I've never waited more than 30 minutes for these to be back and ready at 100%.  I must also say that the built in bass boost is awesome for listening to music.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Excellent Product and Customer Service,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

And TOZO T10 allow me to do just that. But the only problem that I am currently experiencing is that when the inside of my ears starts to sweat, the earbuds start to slip out.

Excellent Sound Quality and Bass,The sound quality and bass reproduction are excellent vs other Bluetooth ear pieces I have tried. The only issue I have notice is they take a long time to connect to my phone once they are removed from the case. I have used them in the pool and while walking/running and had no issues with sound quality. I would have given 5 stars but there is the issue of them taking a long time to connect via Bluetooth and once in awhile I have lost connection to my phone when running and my phone was in my backpack.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Keep them always charged and try to keep then connected if possible,I use these head phones for everything working out and driving because I am a truck driver. When working out at times the head phones go in and out of the music when I am at different angles. When trying to connect the head phones to my phone using bluetooth they keep switching to one side then another side then start going back and forward and then the bluetooth connection is lost and they just stay on but not connected but after a while they connect back and if I have an important call that's incoming I lose the call because of that situation happening. When I am on the road it is hard for some people to hear me while i am driving even when I have the window all the way up and air off but they are alright. Like how they sit in the case which is cool and how they can charge with a plug or on a battery pad. Easy to carry around.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Better than AirPods!,"I loved the noise cancelation that these have. There is no software based NC, but they do seem to plug your ears very well. Audio quality is above and beyond a 50$ pair of earbuds, has wireless charging, case is built really well. I have walked about 50 feet from my phone and had no dropouts in sound.

I would get these over AirPods.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
OK Quality...While They Lasted,"To start, I've had these for just over two months. The sound quality was OK - not great. Better for podcasts/videos than music. The connectivity was OK when the phone was in my pocket, but getting a few feet away or being in a crowded place, the earbuds would cut out constantly.

The issue is, after two months, the portable charging case will no longer take a charge, and so the earbuds are dead with no way to charge them back up. Very disappointing given the number of 5 star reviews this product got. Definitely would not recommend, and definitely not worth $50.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Changed my life.,"I run a business in which I work hard, fast, and needed a way to use music to zone while moving a lot with yanking a cord every two minutes. I was worried about the more expensive wireless earbuds in case my level of activity would be too much for that expense. These proved to be perfect. The sound is great, however slightly lacking in migrating mid-to-high levels (minor detail, not a deal-breaker at all). The bass is perfect for a d&b-head like me, and they stay put. They come with 4 different sized pairs of earbud attachments and I found my ears are happy with the second-to-smallest (I'm female). I have tried them in the shower and it was fine until I started to shampoo and the soap dripped to lubricate the set and they started to slip a little but didn't fall out; not a product problem - function and reliability were not at all affected.

It's important to find the correct-sized earbud adapter (included) and install them correctly - get the ends moist to help slide them on. Install into the ears correctly, too: Put them in with the base pointed down and out toward your face, then twist them up and back so the base now fits into your ear flange and pointed back and up. That'll seal the earbud into your ear.

I've used these extensively, have not had the batteries run out yet, and the ""battery pack"" charge style is SUPER helpful for someone like me who may need to charge these up without having access to a power outlet.
Overall, more than highly recommended over the $$$ earbuds out there that probably work just the same :-)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The right earbud started speaking slowly as if it were a tape recording,"The right earbud started to give pairing problems and speaks slowly.

Great BT Buds for a great price,"I had been wanting a decent pair of bluetooth earbuds for a while, and these fit the bill quite nicely. I’ve only had them for about a week, they do a good job of noise-cancelling, the bass is pretty deep for the price point, and they’re comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, which is something I can’t say for the Apple EarPods. I love how the case can be wirelessly charged, and the case itself holds enough of a charge to fully re-charge the buds a few times, which is super cool. Haven’t tried out the waterproof aspect of it and probably won’t, because I don’t feel the need to use them while showering or swimming. All in all, I’m really happy with them, especially for the price I paid!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Did NOT work for swimming,"I bought these for lap swimming.  They lived for about 5 laps - then the left one died, likely due to water damage as they were fully changed.  When they worked they cut out every time my head was underwater - thus I only heard sound when I was breathing to the right.

The sound quality was great - nice deep bass.  They connected really easily and quickly.  They would be great for sports, just not for real swimming.  I am returning.

Update:  I heard from Tozo who wants to make things right.  They are sending another pair free outside of Amazon and hope that things will work better.  I will add two stars for customer service.  Should the earbuds work underwater and not short out I'll update again.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the casual user,"I got these about two weeks ago knowing nothing about wireless headphones, having an iPhone I knew AirPods weren’t going to work for me and the case I use is waterproof so I didn’t want to have the charge port open all the time. These fit well in my ears, were a little snug to adjust to the size and weight but after trying various sizes of the adaptors my ears just needed time. The sound is good, no complaints, there are times where is can cut out or jump between the buds but it’s manageable. I’ve been able to wear these around the house with good quality and little Bluetooth loss.  I have worn these in the shower with care, I am not sure how waterproof they may be but they work for my needs.

"Not great, but not horrible, getting what you pay for.","I bought these to replace a halfway decent bluetooth headset I used for running that crapped out on me after a solid 18 months of use.  I am pretty sweaty so I figured I'd give the wireless earbud style a shot and see what it was like given the IPX8 waterproofing certification.  The price is... compelling.  50 USD for a pair of wireless earbuds is hard to ignore.

So... how are they?  Decent.

The sound quality is decent.  I am no audiophile, but I wouldn't call the sound quality to be any more than that.  Acceptable range so most music genres sounds nice, podcasts come through clearly enough.

The Charging Pod is convenient and keeps the lil stinkers from bouncing around in my bag and maintaining a good charge.  Given I routinely loose small things, this is something I am actually pleased with.  Magnets keep the earbuds fixed in the case for storage and charging.  The case itself acting as a battery pack is a nice touch to avoid constant re-charging.

I've not had any significant issues with connection in-and-out while running.  I admittedly do not use these for just normal listening or phone call purchases.  They paired to my apple watch without issue and play with only the occasional hiccup.  They seem to have better connection quality to my watch than my previous running headset so that was nice to see.

First mildly annoying issue are the buttons and controls.  They are more than a bit on the unresponsive side.  Difficult to press the button on either of the two earbuds without my finger slipping or feeling like I'm going to crush the plastic housing into my ear.  Both sides have the same control options, and there is no volume control so you are going to have to use the source of your audio to manage that.

The fit is not bad, but not great.  There are a nice set of optional silicone sizes to try to get the optimal fit.  And for a cursory test of music walking through my home, that seemed like a good fit.  Then I went for a run.  They just didn't 'quite' fit right, with one or the other starting to wriggle its way out every 4-5 minutes or so.  Not so bad for a short run but if you go for distance, this will probably become infuriating.  It very much feels like a loop or band could (and should) be affixed to loop around the back of the ear to combat this with a minimum of fuss.  It honestly seems like they are on the cusp of a solid robust fit that would handle the trials of head bouncing from any vigorous exercise.

I'd give it a 2.5 Star Review if that were possible.  Given the price and the relative quality even to wired sets I've owned, bumping it up to 3 seems fair.  But pretending these are great is being very generous indeed.  A better set can be had, just be prepared to pay for it.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality,"Finally ones that work! I have tried two other brands. They were awful. Junk. These are easy to use, sound great. Good seller. Shipped promptly.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not IPX8 or Waterproof!,"Not IPX8 waterproof!  I took it lap swimming and within a minute the left ear bud shorted and the right ear bud was muffled.  IPX8 is defined by depths beyond 1 meter.  I don't know how this company says it can be submerged for 30 minutes, nonetheless in only 2 feet of water without breaking.

The Bluetooth connection was spotty also.  The music would cut out (Bluetooth transmission from my Garmin watch) when running if I move my arm slightly too far back.  My $10 Walmart Bluetooth phones worked better for running.

When it was working, the sound was pretty good.  Slightly heavy on the base.  The case it comes with is pretty sweet too.

I'm returning it, looking for a better product.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound quality!,"Wonderful sound!  Easy to use and most of all a great price!  Numerous ear buds for any ear size.  I also bought TOZO wireless charger for my phone and these ear buds. It’s outstanding too!  I was so impressed that I told all the people at work about these headsets and they bought some and were thrilled with them! The only con is when you change the ear bud part it takes a little patience. They fit pretty tight on there. If somebody has an easy way of doing this please post, that would be great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So much good stuff for the price!,"Wow, set up too all of 2 seconds, you get a bunch of size options so you can really get a great fit and they stay in really well. 1 touch operation on either side to pause music, answer calls, it reject calls.  If there's music playing you can't hear anything else. Can't wait to use these on my next flight.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Update: Seller sent me a replacement,"2nd Update: the seller sent me a second pair that are far better than the original ones I got. I only hear an occasional bit of static or dropout in signal.  These earbuds seem to be a lot louder and have better Bass. For these reasons I'm upgrading my review the four stars especially because the seller is very concerned about making sure the customers are satisfied.

***UPDATE: The sellers are clearly bribing customers for good reviews by sending you an email offering a free charger in return for a good review. I've used the earbuds a few times now and the static just keeps coming back. All I have to do is put my hand near my face and I get static and lose connection in one ear. I never realized how much I touch my face until I try to use these headphones!

I also noticed they're not as loud as the wired ones that came with my phone. I primarily use headphones when mowing my lawn and have a hard time hearing when using these compared to the wired ones.***

I bought these after seeing how much less they are than the ""premium"" brands, and saw how many great reviews they have on Amazon. I opened the box, took the earbuds out of the charger and they connected to each other immediately.  Connecting to my phone was super easy and the sound is very good. I love the magnetic charging case, too.  At first I did have some static so I did a full reset of both buds, per the included instructions. I believe it has fixed that issue.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The Search Is Over,"After trying several different true wireless ear buds (and some not so wireless), I have finally found the perfect pair.
 I workout a ton doing functional training and needed to be free of cords.  I would constantly get the cord tangled and ripped out of my ear mid workout.  OR they would just fall out if I didn’t constantly keep readjusting them. I’m looking at you AirPods!
I tried some true wireless ones and would never be quite satisfied..either they sounded terrible, the battery would die or the sound would cut out cause the phone was too far away....like in my pocket.  I recently ordered these and another pair from amazon that both had extremely high ratings to try them out and get to the bottom of my search.  The other pair were small , sleek and were easy to pair.  I’m thinking alright! These are starting out pretty cool. Nope! They were the worst sounding earbuds I have ever owned (briefly) and would not stay in my ear cause of the TINY earbud portion on them.
 I started to loose hope.  Then I opened these. The TOZO T10!  Right away I loved the design of the buds and case. Feels sturdy. The ear bud portion of it was a perfect snug fit (you need that to get the noise canceling and bass)!  It paired with the phone with in seconds and it was off to the races!  I seriously tried to knock these things out but they stayed out! And the sound?  These are phenomenal for the price!  Deepest base I have ever had and definite noise cancellation!  Plus the IPx8 waterproofing gives some relief cause I sweat! Never a problem! The battery lasted forever too. Don’t think I charged them the whole week working out 1+ a day. Also I have set my phone down and walked 10-15 feet away and you couldn’t tell from the headphones.  They stayed clear as day!  Freedom!!
The added bonus was that people can actually hear me when I make phone calls!  I never got them for this cause I have never found a pair that came close to providing that service but these do it!!  Awesome, awesome product!

Great for running with Apple Watch or phone.,"These are overall great headphones for my needs.  They clearly state when you turn them off and on and when they are paired.  The lights are helpful, also, to know when they are on and when they are charging.  The charging box has lights to tell you the battery level left in it. They stay in my ears for running.  I frequently run with only one because they are so noise cancelling, I can’t hear traffic, other people, birds, etc.  You need to turn both of them on first before taking one out, otherwise it beeps at you to let you know that you are missing one.  That one needs to stay within range also or again, it will beep at you.  Connects flawlessly to my Apple Watch.  My one complaint is that the range is only about 2 feet.  That is fine for running/connecting to my watch, but doesn’t work so well (at all) when I’m on the treadmill and want to connect to my TV across the room.  Also, if I put my watch hand behind my back when running-even for a second-it starts to lose connection.  That is a pretty short range!  Overall happy with them and they stay in way better than AirPods.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Sound good, work on a motorcycle but a few concerns","First off these sound very good. Not like Movie theater good but for someone that is under a 1/2 inch wide and thick very good.

I use them when on my motorcycle. I haven't fully tested battery life start to finish, but I would say less than the 3.5 hours provided. The other concern I have for the battery is that when charging wirelessly on my Samsung wireless charger (haven't checked wired) that it never sends a fully charge signal to the charger leaving it to possibly over charge.

THey also will beep for about 90 seconds not listed if paired as just one headset. I also never  see the ""Master"" as listed only the Toz R or Toz L (Forget the correct working they use) and it shows connected but it will beep if only one is paired for abotu 90 seconds.

They fit comfortably in my ears using the default plugs and make riding better. I can hear using a half helmet and it 100% cuts down on the outside noise.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality.,"Probably the best wireless earbuds I've used. The sound quality is great. The one before that I used, I had to put the volume up to half at least before I could hear anything. With TOZO I could hear it below half. It was bulkier than I expected it to be but I got used to it after a while. The smaller earbuds also fit pretty snuggly in my ear. I like the overall experience I have with it so far.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
As good as advertised,Just got them and have used them once at the gym.  They were hard to get paired but after a few attempts I was able to get everything working. They stayed in my ears comfortably throughout my workout and were not affected by sweat and stayed solid in my ears. The sound quality is great and I am very pleased with my purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No volume or track controls from the earbuds,"Sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is average.  Size is a bit bulky (a little Frankenstein's monster-ish).  Fit is maybe a little above average, i.e. they don't fall out of my ears but do get a little uncomfortable after extended use.  My main issue is the lack of any controls from the earbuds other than play/pause (and redialing the last phone number with a double-tap).  I really wish this was a more common feature as it doesn't require more than 1 button per earbud (just requires multiple taps).  Granted, I realize you can't have total control this way, but it's a significant advantage at the gym, while taking walks, doing chores around the house, etc. to not have to take out my phone just to nudge the volume up or down, or quickly rewind a podcast or audiobook for that last bit my brain was too distracted to hear (or fast-forward past a commercial).  I guess wireless earbuds are a relatively new technology, and I'm still waiting for a pair with these features that also last longer than a few months before failing.  I'll update if these break down in short order as well, though they will likely serve mostly as a backup.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great product worth every dollar.,"This product seems like it's worth a lot more than $50. Having a a year warranty also made me feel good. I did not want to purchase airbuds or the Galaxy version because I just don't think paying $200 for something that will have another model come out next year makes any sense.

The sound and bass is amazing

The battery last about 2 1/2 hours and die

The charger case it comes with feels very high quality and durable and it's cool how it's magnetic.

I've had them for about a week now and my only problem with them is I don't know if it's my ear, but the left ear is able to stay in my ear but the right one falls out and it is very frustrating.

I'll keep trying on the other sizes/angles to see if I see any different results, I really hope this works for me or I will just end up giving them as a gift.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic earbuds for 1/3 the price of Apple,"I saw a featured article on these earbuds in my news feed and after reading the other customer reviews I decided to give them a chance.  Amazon shipping delivered them promptly and the very professional packaging impressed.  Inside the buds were very well packaged and included all the necessary charge cables and additional foam fittings for various ear sizes.  Four sizes in total and I settled on the second largest for best fit for sound quality and ability to stay seated during movement.  I am not planning to use these while exercising, running, biking, etc … just walking and doing chores around the property, and for this they fit and stayed seated really well.  Being very small I did not have high expectations for the sound quality as most are very thin and tinny sounding.  These earbuds have a substantial amount of bass an actually produce an overall balanced and nice sound for my preferred pop and rock music.  I cannot comment on volume as I have no intention of cranking up to max to see what they will do, but at a normal, comfortable level they are fantastic.  Final comments are on the charge/carry case.  Very well constructed with a great fit & finish... the bugs pair when removed and auto power off when placed back.  I'd like the case to be a bit smaller but it's a fine trade in exchange for the additional charges it carries.  Plus it's nicely rounded and smooth so slips into (large) pocket very easily.  All in all I'm delighted with this purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value & Perfect for the Gym,"I have always had trouble finding the perfect ear buds, especially ones that will stay in my ear when at the gym.  After reading the reviews on these headphones, and doing online research, I gave these a try.  I could not be more satisfied.  The sound quality is excellent, and they fit in my ears perfectly.  The earbuds come with multiple tips, so you have options to find the fit that works perfect for you.  I also enjoy the sweatproof feature, which is perfect when walking outside on a hot day, or for working out.  The charging case is also very handy. It automatically charges the headphones, so you never have to worry about putting in your headphones and them being dead.  Lastly, the bluetooth pairing was one simple step.  Incredible value for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are keepers.,"This is the 4th pair of bluetooth earphones I've purchased in about the last 6 weeks.  One was returned, the other two were ""meh"" and I'll keep them for backups or something, but these are definitely keepers.  Based on the pictures I thought they'd probably be heavy and/or would fall out, but they paired very easily (to my desktop PC with a 4.2 bluetooth dongle), sound great, and really are very light.  I can barely feel them, and they don't fall out.  Personally, I like sitting with just one in my ear so I can still hear if the kids want something or the SO has a question (and when I'm walking the dogs so I can hear traffic) and these are fine in that respect.  I can use one and leave the other in the charging case and they don't disconnect.  I'm perfectly happy with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

This is a great product!,"I really love these wireless earbuds.  They took some getting used to for me because I've never had truly wireless earbuds before, but every time I used them, I loved them more and more.  The sound quality is a bit shrill in the high end when the volume's louder and with certain songs, but for the most part, they are really great.  It was a bit tricky to get them to sync and connect together and sometimes it still takes a few tries, but once they connect, they connect strongly.  The charger pod it comes with is really convenient as well.  Now that I've experienced this kind of wireless earbud, I'll probably never go back.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great value and unexpected quality!,"I had gone through two pair of the Apple wireless ear buds and lost both pair due to their falling out of my ears becasue of the loose fit!  I read many reviews and looked at several options before settling on the TOZO 10t.
When I received the earbuds, I charged them and began using them right away.  I did have to change out the buds to provide a snug fit and once I did,  they did fit perfectly and provided a comfortable fit.  Be certain to rotate the buds once they set in the ear!  This prevents their falling out and loss.
Pairing was easy and it was just a matter of a minute before I was able to enjoy listening music.  The sound quality is better than anything that I have had in the past - the sounnd was rich and as I enjoy listening to podcasts, the voice quality was great as well.

Blew my expectations.,"I used to work in Best Buy and I have more or less used a lot of premium headphones, true wireless, noise canceling you name it.

I have been using these ever since I got em and enjoying them more than I enjoy my other premium headphones. I only bought this for the gym but now I am using them on a daily basis.

First off, let me say this, these things are comfy, sound great and connect easily to whatever device I pair them with. Secondly, they are a great value for what you are getting, and if it weren't for some niggling issues, the rating would be higher.

My biggest issue is the random disconnects from the left earbud; it will work perfect fine about 75% of the time, then out of the blue just drop and cut out all sound for a second or two (tested with Pandora, Spotify, Youtube and Facebook videos on an Ipad Air 2 and an IPhone 8). Not sure if it is an issue with the Bluetooth connectivity between the Left and Right earbud, but the source is usually never more than a foot away from either, and it still happens.

Other than that, they fit great, sound great and are super easy to connect, and the wireless charging is a bonus. It's just keeping them connected that seems to be the issue. Going to try and submit a warranty claim with Tozo to see if we can get this rectified.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Horrible for calls, slow to pair, primitive for the price, but music quality is okay","When I bought these, I only used them for music and they seemed fine.  As I was unfamiliar with a variety of earbuds, I did not know that these are actually very limited compared to other ones.  Many competitive products like the $59 TaoTronics SoundLiberty 77 Earbuds are also waterproof but provide controls to change volume, track, play/pause, and even use Google Assistant/Siri directly from the earbuds.  That alone makes these earbuds very limited and and not a very good value, but I had a much bigger problem with these.

The audio for calls would only pick up voice at about half volume or lower.  If I get really loud, only then can the person on the other end of the call understand me.  Since getting these, I've purchased several other earbuds for different purposes and when tested with my phone or my spouse's phone, they all work perfect for calls except the TOZO earbuds.  The issue is not with my devices or setup, it is specifically the TOZO ear buds.  I contacted support and after 2 weeks they responded asking if I would accept a 20% refund asking if I could please not return these.  At the end of the day, why would I want a slightly lower priced pair of earbuds that still do not work?

Additionally, pairing is extremely slow with these.  When I take the earbuds out, it takes 5 seconds to pair with each other, and then another 10 seconds to pair with my phone.  Basic SoundPEATS earbuds or the TaoTronics SoundLiberty 77 earbuds, for instance, instantly pair with each other and your device.  If my phone starts ringing or my laptop has an incoming business call, I simply put those in my ear and can casually answer the call by the second ring.

Horrible microphones, horrible customer service.  Do your homework and find a better product.  I originally purchased the TOZO earbuds based on the quantity of reviews thinking it must be good if thousands of people rated them 4/5 stars.  This product falls short in so many areas and only has Chinese based support.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent wireless ear buds,"Holy smokes, I like these! They pairing is instantaneous and the sound quality is amazing. I've had to fiddle around with the different sized ear covers to find the best fit, but the kit included everything that i could need. I use these at work and my only complaint is that they battery life won't last all day. Perhaps that is asking too much for such a small device. However, the recharge time is really quick and then I'm back to rocking out. This is my fourth pair of wireless listening devices and by FAR my favorite.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
First pair defective but read on,"I would have given 4.9 stars because first pair out of the box had an issues with connectivity, the left ear bud would drop sound for a second or two then function again for 10 -15 min then drop again. Also you could touch the right bud all you wanted no issues however touch the left bud and it would crackle and drop sound.
Now the good news.
I got them replace in 24 hrs after request.  I am using the seconds pair as I write and so far no drop issues, no crackling when touch.
Look and feel is excellent, I used the first pair while pressure cleaning and even wet that work fine (well except for above) Bases response is as good as other more expensive buds i have owned, but like all buds bass is best and deepest when the buds are properly seated in the ear. Have not test noise cancellation, but not looking for much in this area because buds will never be as good with noise as head sets with full ear covering cups.
P.S. Finally fully water proof!!!!
So far I like these buds and would not hesitate recommending these to other purchaser.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best wireless earbuds for desk jobs.,"What I like about these earbuds is they are not that visible in the office environment. I work in a office space downtown and spend most of my hours working at my desk on a computer but these TOZO T10 earbuds help the day go past smoothly, while watching my favorite show/videos on YouTube. I like these earbuds a lot because I can also exercise with them on and they won't fall out my ears. Great job TOZO, can't wait for the upgrade.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great value,"These earbuds are very convenient particularly at the gym.  But they have a tendency to fall out if you perspire a lot.  Of course I'm still working with them and I may find a way to keep them from sliding out but for now it's a problem.  The noise cancellation is okay but not great.  They are light and comfortable particularly while doing homework,  housework and other activities.  I would strongly recommend this product.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product at a great price!,Great product for the price! I like the storage and charging station that you can charge with the provided USB cable or if you have a Wireless charging unit you can simply place the storage along with the headphones on the charging station and it will charge automatically.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrific Sound!,Excellent sound quality and very simple to pair and use.  I received these wireless earbuds the other day after realizing my iPhone no longer has a port for earphones.  They have four different sizes of ear pieces so you are pretty much guaranteed to find the perfect fit.  I paired with my iPad and iPhone and wore them comfortably to watch a show while working out at the gym.  They delivered crystal clear sound and canceled out the gym noise.  I love them already.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty Good for the Price,"I will be honest I was surprised by the quality of the sound and overall product. I like how easy it is to link to phone device and they come with different ear bud sizes. I do recommend buying the wireless charger, I keep forgetting to charge them and I haven’t used them in a couple of weeks.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice surprise .... works well,"It's great to go cordless. Sound quality is good, though I notice a little rumbling on the low end with deep bass. Carry case and recharging unit work well. In all, it was a pleasant surprise and a great bargain as a daily special.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wish I knew about these sooner,Waterptoof! Great. Sound is loud and crisp. I like for my music to remove any extra sound and these do a great job and the case is a charger you can't beat that,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Easy to use, wireless charging and larger capacity battery case great features.","The earbuds worked seamlessly and well out of the box.  I use them while hiking the hills with my dogs and when working at my desk - I can still hear outside noises when needed for safety, but can listen to music without disturbing others.  The earbuds are comfortable even during exercise, and they fit securely.

Using the earbuds as a headset with my cell phone is easy as well.  I do have to experiment with how they handle the Google assistant.

The audio quality is at least stereo Hi-fi, and the earbuds paired easily with both my phone and laptop.

Wireless charging and having a large backup power source for the phone are terrific features.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great price,I bought these to use instead of AirPods and I have to say I’ve been pleasantly pleased. The sound quality and microphone works great for phone calls. I tried to use these to run but the ear buds tent to fall out. Great product for the price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound quality, good noise cancellation, and amazing battery life!","I bought this product a few weeks ago after browsing many kinds of bluetooth earbuds, and so far, I'm very happy with my choice. The sound quality is excellent (about the same as my over ear headphones), and during these two weeks, I only had to charge the case once (and I use them everyday during my commute to work and back, which is about an hour round trip). At first, the earbuds were a little too big for my ears the way they came, but they also include many different sizes of the little round thing that goes on top of the earbud, and switching to the smallest size was perfect for me.
TL;DR: If you're looking for an affordable yet good quality set of earbuds (especially for music) I would recommend these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality for the price!,"Great product. Way worth the money. The bass is outstanding compare to AirPods, I wear them when taking showers or sitting in tubs. The only complaint is the tips are tooo big. I have to use other Bluetooth’s rubber cover.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best in-ear ever!,"I bought the TOZOs because they appeared to be better made than most, and they are.  I was also curious about the T10's 8mm drivers that boasted being 1.77X the norm.  Right again to the point of awesome.  I was watching the CGBros on YouTube when I first tried them.  - It was like Dolby theatre sound.. every digital nuance was crystal clear.  You can feel the bass in your cranium without blasting your ear drums.  In fact, they are so accurate that you notice the dramatic difference between HD signal and the others.  But they're still good for bumping some Roger Troutman..  lol",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Function are not ideal,"This is great set of headphones,they fit tight, sound great. But the battery life is less then ideal and the functions are terrible.. I cannot change song or replay song for headphones. Only pause and call last number dialed?

Other then that they are great.. would like something that has better functions

Edit 4/30/19

I have updated to 5 stares!  Their customer service has been fantastic and has sent me a different set of headphones! Quick response and great trying make it work with what I need..",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not fittin’,"First order was used rather than new- earwax was present on the earbuds.
Reordered a NEW new pair, and they came swiftly. Tried them out:
Decent sound, easy to pair to electronics, material is low quality (I mean, they are only 30 something dollars), but seemed okay. The darned things would not fit in my ear, so I returned them. I tried all the earbuds (with fairly clean ears, I cleaned the buds upon returning) and they would not lock/stay into my ear. Wish they would fit.
Bought them with the intention to use with workouts and swimming.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product and customer service!,I ordered this after trying several others and wow! what a difference.  The sound quality and the ease of using this was amazing.  My batter case didn’t charge anymore and after contacting TOZO they were extremely helpful in getting the matter straightened out.  Everything about the product and the customer service is tops in my book.  Will be buying for gifts because I trust the product enough to do so.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't recommend,"I wanted to love these earbuds. They were a little heavier than my old ones  and the reception wasn't as good, but they charge quickly. I listen to books and music a lot and within two weeks I started having problems. My phone can't connect, they can't connect to each other, they fall out because they are so heavy. Maybe I just got lemons.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and quality!,"Love these! I was hesitant to get these wireless small headphones but I love them! They give you different size ear pieces to make sure they fit perfectly. The sound quality is great and when testing them while talking to my family, they said they hear me great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value for the money,"These earbuds have great sound quality while simultaneously cancelling out background noise. I use them while working in my home office, driving or traveling for business. In each case they work better than expected, especially for the price. For long international flights the ability to pre-charge the case and then take it with you on the plane or long drives, effectively extending the battery life of the earbuds, is very convenient. Bluetooth syncs with my Windows laptop and Galaxy S9+ cellphone with no problems.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, easy to pair, great fit, compact design.","I have weird ears and struggle to find headphones that stay in my ears and don't fall out.  I was hoping that Apple's AirPods would be an exception, but they too did not fit.  Also, the sound quality was disappointing on the Apple AirPods.  I saw that these Tozo earbuds had 10,000+ 5-star reviews and I decided take a chance on them.

After charging them, the pairing was easy.  You pair the right earbud (master) to your phone and the left one (slave) pairs itself to the right one automatically.

It came with 4 different sizes of ear tips and one of them actually fit my ears perfectly!  I was so happy to find earbuds that fit.

The best part however, is the sound quality.  They blow the Apple Airpods out of the water.  The tighter seal of the Tozo earbud inside your ear canal channels the sound more directly than the AirPods.  It's a much richer sound with much stronger bass.

I have been super happy with this purchase.  Hopefully these will stand the test of time...",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect Solution!,The perfect solution for what we were looking for plus more!  We purchased to used outside to watch movies without disturbing our neighbors and while floating in our pool. These have been a perfect solution!  The sound quality is great and they stay in place.  We purchased two just for the above reasons but hubby and I are now also using them for work as well!  We are very happy with our purchase!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buy for the price,I bought these ear buds mostly to use while at work so I wanted them to be wireless and a bit discrete too. These earbuds are great for me. I was worried about buying earbuds off amazon cause of all the scammers out there but these have impressed me quite a bit. They are pretty small with a decent connection range and great sound quality. I was wondering how well they would stay in cause I would be moving around a lot and I also have pretty small ears but they stay great they come with different size buds which was great. And it also has a somewhat portable charger. It has a case that can hold about a four hour charge so u can charge ur buds while on the go if they die out on yay. Overall a great purchase for me I’ve recommended them to a few of my coworkers.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and really comfortable!,"I have been wanting Earbuds for quite some time now. After doing some research I came across these earbuds and I am already so impressed! I used them last night for my very high impact workout and they didn't even budge. The moment I take them from their case they connect within seconds and connect to my phone as well! (No more having to fiddle with settings, trying to locate them, etc.) The sound is super clear and crisp as well and noticed the noise cancellation is excellent as I couldn't hear my boyfriend talking to me while I was wearing them and had music on.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worked well. For 3 weeks,"These buds fit well and incredible don't fall when I'm running.
However, only after 3 weeks of low / no use, the left earbud stopped charging and working.
I have requested a replacement and will update this review if I have a different experience with this new pair.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exceeded expectations,"I have had the earphones now for a few weeks and I can day the T10 ear buds are fantastic for their price as they exceeded my expectations. They have great battery life, easy to use charging, and the bass in the earbuds is quite spectacular. They are great for running and daily activities without the fear of them falling off. The only con is that turning on/off or pausing requires to actually press the button rather than touch sensitive. The reason it's a con because the ear is sensitive when pressing the earbuds in and must be  careful not to damage your ear drum( of course this can be resolved by removing the earbuds and doing it that one which is a bit inconvenient). Overall a 5/5. *NOT A PAID REVIEW*

Great ear buds!,"I’m rely heavily upon ear buds for my workouts but have had trouble finding a high quality affordable pair in the past.

Extremely happy with this purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality>waterproof,"If you only want these for there waterproof then go ahead. Microphone is terrible making it rather frustrating to talk to someone. If both earbuds aren't connected you get an annoying tone every 8 seconds or so. Earbuds lose connection between themselves quite often. Most of these product have a feature to skip a song but not this one. They are very big, projecting too far out the ear.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
everything I hoped they would be.,Very impressed with these earbuds.  I have bought different ones over and over.  Finally found a pair that is exactly what I need.  Good sound.  Nice bass.  I even rode my Harley with them in and they did not even feel like they wanted to fall out.  But most of all they phone calls are very good.  The person on the other line can actually hear me now.  I love this product.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrific value for the price,"Honestly, I loved these wireless earbuds and they were a great addition to my workouts. Compared to wired earphones or attached wireless earphones, these got in the way much less. Sadly as I was waiting for the bus one morning, my right earbud fell out of my ear and I watched as it bounced into a sewer. Unfortunately that means that I am without working earbuds now, but they were great while they lasted.

PROS:
-Easily connected
-Sound quality was pretty decent
-Charging while in its carrying case is amazing

CONS:
-Hard time finding right fit for my ear
-Must have both earbuds to work (or at least have the right earbud)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Amazing Battery Life!,"I have used bluetooth headphones in the past, but they have been over the ear, not ear buds. I am so happy with these ear buds. They fit snugly and the sound quality is great. The battery life is what sets these apart from any of the other bluetooth headphones I've had. I love the rechargeable case. I just pop the ear buds in the case and it automatically starts charging, without even being plugged in.  So far I'm extremely happy with the fit, the sound quality and the battery life. I haven't tested out the water resistance, but I love that I don't have to worry as much about getting them wet. Looking forward to getting lots of use out of these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Enjoyed mildly before they broke 6 weeks in,"I've had these for about 6 weeks. The first couple weeks I didn't use them much as they seemed to beep at me constantly. Once I got more used to that I liked them more, but the battery life was minimal and they didn't stay in very well while running. As of about 3 days ago the right one started acting odd and had a different sounding voice, the yesterday it completely stopped working. So now I have one headphone that I mildly trust to work. Don't get these if you are looking for long term headphones.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than the price indicates,"You don’t expect much in the price range, however these exceed expectation.

The batteries give several hours of use... overall I can’t complain one bit... nice set",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value for the $,"These ear buds sound fantastic!  Solid bass, and full range sound that equals anything I have tried before.  They also stay put in my ears a lot better than i thought they would when I bought them.  The only thing I can honestly complain about is that they don't control volume ....  however,  since the floor volume level is set fairly high,  the device (phone, other Bluetooth device) volume can control the ear bud volume quite well.  I find myself turning DOWN the volume on the device rather than wishing it could get louder.  All in all,  a really solid item,  and i am very pleased with my purchase.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality sound for a reasonable price!,"So far so good! The sound quality and battery are good. I tested out the waterproofing in the shower and no problems. I like that I can use each earbud individually since I can only hear out of one ear. The only downside is no volume control on the earbud, but my phone is usually handy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Just like the reviews claim,"I spent quite a bit of time researching various earbuds after my wife bought some earPods and wouldn't stop gloating about them. I accepted the challenge to find <$200 earbuds that were of comparable quality.

While I will say that these are not as versatile as the earPods (earPods don't feel as stuffy as these ones do, and have better noise pass-through when off), I sure love the fact that these cost about 25% of the price as hers. Not to mention, I can use these in the shower! I've had them drop out of my ears several times, no problem.

IP68 earbuds? Awesome!

I've also managed to have these in around 70% volume for ~3 hours, and the battery has only died on me once. I don't remember how long they were in for, to be honest, but over 3 hours.

Excellent product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Phenomenal Quality!,"After a month of using them, I could honestly say, the TOZO T10 earbuds are great quality! The sound quality is exceptional. Great base and balance all throughout. They are comfortable, it feels as if you have no earbuds on! They are firm and will not leave your ear. They last me all throughout my 12-hour shifts at work! Finally, the charging is extremely quick! If you are looking for earbuds that compete with that of Apple and Bose, these are it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Product,"I'm very happy with these. When you consider price point vs features, these buds excel in quality and performance. Pairing was a breeze. I love they way they auto turn on and off when removed and replaced in the case. Use one earpiece or two. These buds are smart enough to know your choice with no extra clicks or buttons to push. Music and voice navigation is easy. The case is compact and light. I can charge it on the weekend and use it at work all week. If you're looking for value, this is it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don’t stay synced when streaming music.,"The sound quality is great. They stay in ear well when working out. The biggest down fall is that the left and right bud do not stay streaming at the same time. Audio on the left channel drops in and out when music is playing for the slightest reason. Head movement, phone movement, standinging still... it’s very annoying if your trying to get into a groove to have one ear bud just stop working for zero reason. For that reason alone I give it a 2 star because that is over all terrible quality for headphones.

—-update—-

The company reached out to me after I posted my original review offering to send me a new pair in exchange for a better review.

Terrible Bluetooth strength,"The sound quality and volume of these headphones was good as well as the comfort. However, the Bluetooth strength and battery are awful. I had my phone in my pocket at work and was walking around like the hunch back of Notre Dame trying to avoid it going in and out. Additionally, the battery only lasted like 2 hours.

T10 > AirPods,There is a reason for the high reviews. I have an iPhone XS and not even at half volume you can’t hear anything besides the music. The case Is well constructed and the quality is well beyond the price. My only issue is my ears are narrow so the SM buds are a little to big for me but they still don’t fall out because they fit so well into the ear-well. And it comes with a 1yr warranty.

Perfect Purchase,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!

These are exactly what I was looking for.  I did a lot of research and wanted to make sure that the earbuds I purchased could be used independently (one at a time) and also had multiple sized umbrellas for my ears.  I've had multiple surgeries on my left hear and the ear canal is much bigger than on my right, not to mention I'm mostly deaf in the left ear.  With both earbuds in I can hear just fine but usually just use my right one.  The wireless charging case is awesome and they are magnetically drawn into the each respective holder to charge.  They seem to hold their charge for a long time and the charging case is said to hold enough power to fully recharge three times.  I haven't seen it run out yet but haven't used them so often where that would be much of an issue.

They look good, fit well and the sound is quite good.  I only use it for me workouts and don't do a lot of treadmill/running so I can't speak to how they hold up to more jarring activities but they are perfect for gym visits where I use weight machines, rowing machines, etc.  Based on the fit, I don't think anyone would have a problem with these for most exercise.

Highly recommend these if you don't want to spend over $100 for earbuds or conductive headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for wireless Buds.,"So far so good, I’ll update my review as I continue to use them. They have worked great in extreme cold weather and while working out. The battery life is great and the earbuds stay in place while running. One thing that bothers me was, after registering my device the manufacturer reached out with a request to provide a review. I’m not sure how I feel about that tactic as it makes me think that they think their product isn’t good enough to warrent a review.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic sound quality and levels!,Really pleased with this product! Slightly heavier than I expected but the sound is fantastic!

Again really pleased!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for the price!,"The buds paired easily, and I really liked the different sized earcaps which I played around with til I found the right size.  I had thought, like others have said, that my order was missing the earcaps, but they were in the little box; it just felt like it was empty after I removed the charging wire but they were in there.  I bought the buds to listen to podcasts whilst loafing around - and they are perfect for that - but I'm not sure that they would withstand much activity. But for me, what I use them for, and the price, they work great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Loses connection constantly.,"These lose connection to my phone constantly when it's in my pocket. Doing something as trivial as crossing my arms across my chest will cause them to completely fail. Whatever side pocket I keep my phone in, the same side earbud will cut out in time with my steps.

Lightweight, durable, and they charge QUICK. Possibly the biggest surprise was how good the sound quality is for such a low price; they don't skimp out on bass or noise cancellation either. They've got a pretty long range as well--I've left my phone sitting in another room and am still within range (even with a wall in the way). Perfect for the gym, shower, around the house, etc.

My old pair was a set of Sony MDRXB50AP Extra Bass buds, which were really nice for the price.  The TOZOs are beyond better,  and well worth the extra $20.

Sound quality is the best I've ever had in an earbud in this price range (I've never spent more than $50 on buds, but with these I don't feel the need to).  The bass is much more powerful than my old Sony's without drowning out the mids and highs (though if you disagree, equalizer settings on most phones can rectify this).

These are really simple to use as well.  Initial pairing took less than a minute.  From there, take out the right bud, give it a sec to pair, then take out the left one.  That's it.  Putting them back in the case disconnects and charges them.  I haven't had a chance to test battery life, but there are many other reviewers here that have.

Customer service is also top notch.  They'll email you a few days after you've received the buds to make sure everything is running smoothly.  They'll also throw in a wireless charger if you leave a review (they didn't ask me to write a 5 star review, I'm sure they'll send a wireless charger no matter how you rate it).  They seem to really care about their product, and it shows.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's a beast in small package!! Ultimate item,"Ohh Man, this is the best wireless earbuds one can find for less than 50 bucks.. truly impressed with the quality and the sound output.. forget all expensive earbuds and go for this.. you will never find better than this even though you spend more bucks... It's truly waterproof. Only thing I have not tested the calling feature supported by it. Just close your eyes and buy this. The sound quality is superb at low volume as well as high volume. It's able reproduce the perfect sould effect for low volume which is the best part of it and one this it's loudness is solid you satisfaction is Guaranteed!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth it.,I did not like these headphones at all. They keep glitching. The button to push to pause/turn off is really hard to press and has redialed to call people when I was trying to just turn it off. It's clunky and cheap material. I would say spend an extra 50 or whatever and get something better. These are a waste of money and definitely not worth 50 bucks. I would say the sound quality is worse then a pair of 15 dollar wired headphones.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent product, excellent price!","I have been looking at earbuds for a while, and haven’t been able to justify the price... until now. The sound quality is fabulous, pairing with my iPhone is super simple, the charging case is super sleek and portable. I love that they have added four different size options for the silicons pieces that fit inside your ear. It makes the perfect fit possible for all ears!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awkward fit,"These headphones are too big. I put on the smallest ear piece attachement and they still didn’t fit well and kept falling out. I have no problems with other wireless headphones when it comes to size so I don’t think my ears are strangely small. They also protrude out of the ear a decent amount. All in all, they don’t fit well and look awkward. I can’t judge the sound quality since I couldn’t use them as designed.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality!,"I absolutely love these so far! They do fall out a little easier than I'd like when sweating in the gym or doing yoga, but the sound quality is excellent, they are light weight, easy to pair, charge and use! I bought white for me and black for my husband and he feels the same! We've tried swapping the silicon ear pieces to the different sizes that are included, but that didn't change anything or make the slippage better. It's not terrible slippage, but enough to be just a little annoying. Otherwise these would get 5* from us, especially for the price. They work better than the earbuds I spent 3x the $$ for I had to replace.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best Budget TWS ever.,"This product is great the sound is up to par with my bose earbuds.
They fit comfortably in my ear, at first I thought they were too big but the earbuds come with different gel sizes.

"Good for large ears, not so much for smaller ones",I really wanted to like these but they are just not good for my small ears. I wanted them to workout in since I don’t like the ones with the cord on them but even with the smallest ear bud in them they just don’t fit my ears well,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Bluetooth Earbuds!,"These Bluetooth earbuds are amazing! The sound is exceptional, and the fit is perfect. I am so pleased to have found such a great wireless hearing device at such a good price. I've had more expensive units, but this has made me enjoy my music and audio books way better. Thank you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love them,"The sound quality is amazing.  Best earbuds of any II've ever owned, not just for a $50 pair of earbuds but ANY, even sets where I've paid 2-3x the price.  Full base, great volume, good battery life.  SUPER comfortable even after a couple hours of use and they stay in my ears during workouts.  I love the IPX8 and the fact that I can wear them in hte shower or swimming.

The only drawback is the the button functions on the earbuds are geared towards phone calls, not music - no FF/RW or volume.  Missing volume is not uncommon for true wireless but the lack of FF/RW is a big miss.  That said they are so good in every other respect I'm keeping them and would most definitely  buy them again.  Hopefully on their next version they fix the one shortcoming.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the tape needed to return.  Don’t buy!,"I hated these. I started a return no more than 2 minutes after popping them in. They lack in volume. I had the volume all the way up and it was woefully insufficient. Also, there is almost zero bass. And even with the largest buds attached they do a poor job of blocking out outside noise.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No sound volume control,"i bought this earplug to use with my VR. But i found a few serious problems that make it impossible to meet my needs. First of all the buttons on these ear pieces lack critical functions, such as raise up/drop down sound levels. When i use my phone for VR, i don't have access to the phone buttons to adjust sound volume. Also it lacks next/previous functions when playing music. One extra annoying issue is pressing right ear button once will redial last phone no. which is a huge piss-off. i accidentally dialed the number i hated just because i pressed once trying to stop the music. These earplugs also are not comfortable to my ears. i have tried all sizes that come with it, none will fit comfortably for like 10 minutes. i took off the rubber part and found the stems are too long compared to another model i have. Other than those, it seems to be a OK item. But if you care about what i have mentioned, you might as well look for another product.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Clarity but lacking in Volume,"I bought these because I wanted totally wire free earbuds.  These are a little bulky, but deliver a quality sound.  I wouldn't describe them as noise cancelling, as when using the pair, as opposed to just one so one ear remains open to all sounds, the volume tops off a little too low for my liking.  Using for Amazon Music and the sound on some things are barely audible if there is other active sound in the room.  But there is no upward adjustment that I have found to make them more functional.  I grade them overall a B-minus, for volume and comfort, a ""C-"" for volume and bulkiness, but a solid A for qualify of sound.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really like this product from TOZO,"I have purchased a few different earbuds on Amazon before from different vendors/companies but was not very happy with any of them. They were either of poor sound quality or the volume was too low or the battery life was not very good until I found these.
The TOZO T10 surpassed all my expectations. It pairs easily, has a really great sound quality, volume levels are high  and the battery lasts much longer than what I expected. The nice feature I like is that the two devices (left and right) can be paired individually! Would definitely recommend this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing!,"I can't remember the name of the trade organization that gives Best Design awards, but this little package deserves it. As someone who loves buying electronic gadgets of all kinds, I have yet to see one as well designed as this one.

Great sounding headphones.,"I finally got tired of wired headphones getting in the way or getting caught on something and being yanked out of my ears, so I decided to jump on the bluetooth headphone bandwagon and after some research I decided to try these ones out.

90% awesome,"I love these! I ordered them for my birthday after extensively reading reviews, and I've been using them ever since. I haven't noticed a lack of bass, seems solid to me. I've also worn them in the shower with no issue. I only have one very minor complaint so far, that is the escalation in volume when you turn it up.

Would not buy again.,"Very good at blocking out ambient noise. Biggest drawback is that the earphones need line of sight to the paired device. I had issues with them dropping audio with my phone(S7) in my back pocket. I could put my hand over my ear and it would also block the connection to my phone. Sound quality was great, I thought.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Pleased, Good bang for the buck.","Have been using these buds for several days now and I'm very pleased.  They seem well made, sound quality is good, pairing is easy. Noise cancellation is as good as can be expected without active noise cancellation.  Mine came with 4 sizes of pads S,M,L,XL so they should fit anyone and provide decent noise cancellation.  This is my first set of true wireless buds and I was concerned about them falling out.  But with the correct size pads and proper placement in the ear this doesn't seem like it will be an issue.

My previous headset is an LG Tone 780 and these are superior with regards to sound quality for both music and phone calls.  When making phone calls, the other party can hear me loud and clear, better than my LG headset.  Battery life is fine for how I use them.  I'm the type of person that keeps their devices on a charger anyway so I'll never test the full battery capacity of the buds themselves.  The wireless charging case is convenient and works well.

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase so far and I've already recommended the buds to several friends.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Customer Service, Left Channel Issue","When I first tried the TOZO T10 Earbuds I was immediately impressed by their sound quality and ease of connection, unfortunately after a few weeks of use the left channel has gone out, will not connect on the left ear bud.

Not for small ear canals and not for workouts,"Even with the smallest ear bud attached, I couldn't get a firm seal--My left one catapulted out of my ear into the mechanism of the machine I was on and of course jammed it.

Not good for listening while doing other activites,"These would be good while swimming or during other sport activity. When you twist the buds in your ear, they cancel out all other sounds.

Great sound,"These headphones have great sound for a good price. At first it seemed they wouldn't stay in my ears, but once you have the right sized ear buds attached (4 or 5 sizes included) and follow the instructions, they stay in very well while you're working out, jogging, etc.
Hint: You have to turn them until the bigger outer part of the headphones is resting against your outer ear. (Read the manual)
Occasionally they don't turn on, but only until I put them back in the case and take them out again.
One thing missing for me is more controls for my music. While I'm working out, sometimes I want to skip to the next track without returning to my phone. This isn't possible with these headphones. Also, you can't control the volume from them.
If you turn off the Bluetooth on your device they turn themselves off, however, if you don't have the case with you (it's a bit too big to bring with me while jogging), you can't turn them back on again until you return them to the case and take them out again.
Otherwise, they're great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good sounds with major flaw,Just received it today and charged it fully before testing it out.

Only have used these a few times while I'm mowing, literally 4 or 5 times at the most (can't wear them while running as they are too big for my ears) and they barely stay in my ears.
Very difficult to pair and Bluetooth to my phone from the beginning.

design and quality no match for the price!!!,"I gifted my dad this ear bud in advance for fathers day, he loves it surprising that the quality of the product is such great and especially the waterproof feature makes it even more usable on day to day. I am going to order 2 more for me and my wife for workout. highly recommended. sound base is awesome.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear bud cuts in and out,"Overall these ear buds are nice. They fit comfortably. I wore them riding my motorcycle they did not try to come out of place at all. The phone feature works. However, the left ear bud cuts in and out at times, it very annoying. These earbuds would be a 5 star for me if they worked they way they should constantly.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Easy to connect, lightweight... good value and no problems","I just received these yesterday.  The case is light and compact.  Pairing the ear buds to my iPhone happened almost instantly.  They feel comfortable and secure, so far. It's very easy to pause what I'm listening to, as well.  I did notice that the sound would cut in and out, if I walk from my living room to the front guest room (my house isn't huge), so that was a little disappointing.  I use Sony blue tooth ear buds that has much better bass.  So, the jury is still out. I use mine, primarily, to listen to audio books so I can walk around and do my household chores, or listen to a book while walking my dog. I think they'll do fine.  I have a feeling, though, that I'll have to keep my phone in my pocket so the range won't cut out on me. I will update in a few days, after I've used them more. That's when I'll know how the battery life is.
UPDATE: I've had more time to use these ear buds and I've grown to like them a lot. They do fit, snugly, so I don't worry about losing them.  These are super easy to pair. When I lift them out of the charging case, all can hear that the buds are pairing. I go to the Bluetooth in my iPhone and choose the Tozo name and it's paired!  I do have to keep the phone in my pocket, though, if I'm walking around the house-- or I lose the signal.  For the price, I'm happy!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are mostly awesome.,"So far so good. Usually earbuds don’t stay in my ears, but these guys actually do, most of the time. I have had them fall out a couple of times, but not enough to be annoying. They sound great and they can be used independently of each other. I just wish the beeping it makes when it is searching for its mate lasted only half as long, but it will stop searching and let me wear only one when I need to. I like them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Ear Buds,"I have had these earbuds for a couple months and they are great. The battery of each bud lasts close to 3 hours between charging and the case holds at least 2 full charges. I like being able to use just one ear bud individually and they synch to my phone and to each other with no issues. Although they are labeled “left” and “right”, they are the same shape so I can use each in the same ear and switch them out to charge. Sound quality is about what you would expect with wireless earbuds, it’s good but it doesn’t knock your socks off. It could be how they sit in my specific ear, but they do not drown out surrounding noise as much as I would like. Overall a great purchase for the price, would definitely recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BUY THESE NOW! TOZO Believer!,"Man I LOVE THESE EAR BUDS!!! The Bass is crazy! The highs, mids, and lows all sound amazing. I recently bought some Mifo 05s and sent them back after 1 day or so and resumed researching via YouTube and Amazon and these Tozo T10s kept coming up! I’m very happy with my purchase and even if they aren’t “name brand” these are 10 times better than a pair of $250 premium
Beats (which only cost $14 to make) or
Sennheiser, or even my old Plantronics.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound.,The tone is good and the sound is crisp and clear. The bass is very good but fit and bass were improved when I switched to the smaller ear buds. TOZO adds an interesting feature in that when you take the right earpiece out of the case it immediately powers up. Take the left earpiece out and it syncs to the right earpiece. Pairing with my phone was no problem. I am not a runner but I had no issues with the fit or the earpieces staying in place during brisk walks and riding my bicycle.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Ear buds keep falling out of my ears.,"Update: I've inquired more than once about getting the extra small eat tips, but while a customer service rep answered other questions, they failed to respond to the issue about extra small ear tips. Since the earbuds keep falling out, with the left earbud falling out more frequenty, as well as causing ear pain using the small ear tip, I guess I have no recourse except to return them. It's also cringe worthy that the seller is bribe me to better my review.

Original review:
Nice sound. Wish it also included smallest ear buds. Needs a option for a ""leash"" ... Mine have already fallen out into the trash can and into the bathroom sink, and it's only day one!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Sound,"My wife has been using wireless earbuds for a year or so, but I'd been sticking with my wireless over-the-ear full size headphones because I believed they did a better job of isolating or cancelling external sounds. Plus, because they were bigger, they'd produce deeper base than buds, right? I tried her two different brands of buds a couple of times, but wasn't satisfied with the sound of one pair, and the second pair, well, they sounded good but they lost connectivity so often they were essentially useless.

I did some review-surfing on Amazon and found these highly rated Tozos, so I decided I'd give them a shot.

Wow! For under fifty bucks, these can't be beat. Sooooo good! I charged them up, paired them to my phone (just the right bud, mind you), and picked out a few quality rock and roll songs to test them: The Cars - Moving in Stereo, Golden Earring - Twilight Zone, Boston - Foreplay-Long Time, Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak, and Barracuda by Heart. The stereo effect is flawless, the high notes were bright and precise, the mid-range tones and voices were clear,  and and the bass was full and deep. Much better than the standard headphones I have been using.

They fit snugly in my ears and do a great job of blocking most of the ambient noise around me. Add in the fact that they charge wirelessly on the pad of my Samsung phone charger, and I don't know what else you need to know. Make the purchase, you'll be glad you did.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really nice.... sound is good... can use each separately with blue tooth devices at same time.,"They do everything the sellers said they would. Sound is good... reasonably snug and confy… they can also work as a team and give stereo sounds... or, independently and connect to two separate BT devices at once.  It is like you can have two pairs of single ear plugs or have one pair of stereo ear plugs... you get to choose when.  The waterproof quality is just a bonus.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds!,"I ordered the earbuds for my wife, not knowing what to expect because this is the first pair she's owned. She's had several pair of the LG Tone earphones but their reliability has faded over the last couple of years. She's had no problem adjusting to these earbuds. She likes the sound quality very much and has found it to be easier to a answer and talk on the phone than the LG Tones. Overall, she's extremely pleased with these earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super convenience...,"Got it earlier. Worked out of the box.
-Pro: - I can leave my ip down-stair then go up-stair or work outside/front yard still enjoy the music, still connected
  - The treble is super, very clear. The distant should be maintain within 10 feet of the device.
  - Pair easy to my IpX. The box works on wireless charge
-Cons:  - The bass is good still missing some compares to wired buds
  - The volume is limited. I guess it is the wireless limit.
  - For example: I have a skullcandy hesh 2 over-ear headphone which beats this ear phone if wire used but for  wireless the Tozo is more. Otherwise if compare the Tozo to the ""Beats Urbeats3 Earphones with Lightning Connector"" that I also have the Beats is more. Once again I guess it is the limit of wireless.
  All in all this is the best wireless ear phones that I have until now. you shouldn't try to remove 2 ear buds at the same time from the box, just pick one by one then they will be paired easier. Good for recommend to others.
  UPDATED AFTER COUPLE MONTHS:
My left ear bud was out  I contacted the Seller and they sent a new set in about couple days. Excellent customer services.Thanks",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound quality is great,Very impressed with these wireless earbuds. The sound quality is great and the base it has it surreal. I have it on the lowest volume setting and it’s still loud. I was contacted by Winnie from Tozo Services to ensure my satisfaction the day after I registered the warranty. Great to see a company reach out to its consumers to get feedback. I would definitely recommend them to family and friends. It fits great in my ears without falling out. But I usually don’t have any problems like that with other earbuds I’ve used in the past. The real test will come later when I go to the gym or go for a run and bike ride. Very excited about them.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality at a surprisingly great price.,"I decided to look for a Bluetooth headset after getting tired of holding my phone to my ear all the time.  So, I went to Amazon and began my search.  What caught my attention with the TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds is the nearly 9,000 reviews and over 75% 5 stars it had.  After reading about the quality and sound of these earbuds and the cheap price compared to other known brands, I decided to buy them and give 'em a try.  After receiving them the next day, I was presently surprised at how they looked. The charging case is small and solidly made.  After charging it maybe 10 minutes, I was easily able to sync it with my Google Pixel 2 phone.  Since I read that the quality of sound was amazing, I played my first song and was amazed indeed at the quality.  The sound of clarity and bass were smooth with what ever song I played.  I love the fact that you can charge the case itself and in return, it will charge your earbuds.  The call quality is clear as well and I also like the different options the earbuds give you when a call comes in i.e. accept the call, end the call, and call back the previous call.  All and all, I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed and for the price...you can't go wrong.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"does not fit well, seller claims will send gifts for five star review","Bought these to replace another pair of blue tooth ear buds that I purchased that stopped working after a few months.  The sound quality on these is much better and they were much easier to use than the other pair.  However, they did not come with different size covers for the ear buds, and the ones that did come with the earbuds do not fit, they keep falling out of my ears.  After emailing the company with no response I posted a 2 star review.  With that, TOZO sent me a replacement pair that contained various sizes of ear bud covers.  After I received the covers the company sent numerous emails asking for 5 star reviews in exchange for a free charging station.  I did change my review to a 5 star after I received the new set of ear buds... more emails came to ask to confirm the 5 star review with the promise of the gift.  The new covers still were not fitting my ears well.  When using the ear buds on runs, inevitably one would fall out.  I knew I would eventually lose one and today was the day that the left one fell out and is nowhere to be found.

In summary - good sound, easy to use, but the earbuds even with different covers, did not fit in my ears.  And the company appears to bribe for 5 star reviews and then not follow through.  Makes me wonder about the other reviews that have been posted.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Middle of the road,"Pros: battery life, they work
Cons: -EVERY single time i want to use them I have to pair them, they don't remember my device
  -they DO NOT stay in place, they're fine for just sitting and listening but if you're doing anything even remotely active, they move and the music cuts out",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Performs as described! Great product!,"Great product! Sound is great! Fits relatively comfortable. Only complaint I have is both earbuds want to be activated/paired simultaneously (right being the “master” and left being the “slave) and, if attempting to use only one: a redundant tone continues to repeat in search of second earbud. It is a low key tone, thankfully, but slightly annoying. This is only an issue if you’re using them while trying to hear surroundings. Otherwise, noise cancellation is superb! Great for the gym, mowing the lawn, or any other activities that don’t require awareness of surroundings.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Sound, Attractive Appearance, Easy to Use!","I received my wireless earbuds a couple of days ago, and I was able to easily pair them with my Samsung phone as well as my Galaxy Watch (which is primarily what I purchased them for).  The earbuds charge quickly, they fit perfectly in my ears without me feeling as if they're slipping out, and without attempting to put them to a noise cancellation test, I had to take them out when I noticed someone talking to me but I couldn't hear them.  My son was looking for a pair, so after I let him listen to mine, he's also ordering a set!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They fit and they stay in my ears and the battery lasted through the entire workout!!!!!!!!,"I've tried countless earbuds and nothing can stay in my ears. And, if they were wireless, I couldn't get the battery to last for 2 hours at the gym.

This did all of that! I put them in and I could forget them. The blue tooth hooked up to my phone very easily (I had to struggle with other headphones), the battery lasted, and I wasn't spending the entire workout putting them back into my ears.

I can concentrate on my workout now. Yay!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Went dead as soon as I hit the water - not good when bought for swimming workouts.,"I bought these to use while swimming laps after reading some positive reviews. After making a successful pairing with my iPhone, I jumped in the pool to get started with my workout. As soon as I took my first stroke both ear buds went dead. Then the right one came back to life and would only work when I took breaths and wasn’t in the water. I put the left ear bud on the deck and continued swimming with the right. After working intermittently throughout my workout it eventually completely shut down and hasn’t turned on since despite getting charged back up. Very disappointing so still on the lookout for a true pair of waterproof ear buds.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great overall for sports / isolation,"I generally don't do many reviews, but reviews helped me decide on these.  As a musician, I have many earphones, earbuds, etc. $400+ wired ones, and less expensive bluetooth, all for different purposes.

I bought these for exercise and all purpose use, have had almost 2 months, daily use.

Pros:
  1) Sound is surprisingly good and full (iPhone XS Max)
  2) Never cuts out for me anywhere near, and functional range is over 33'.
  3) Seal is awesome and really isolates well (changed foams to Comply my favorites, the T-200's fit these)
  4) Convenient charging of ear buds, wireless charging of case.
  5) Very waterproof.
  6) Fast charge of ear buds.

Cons:
  1) Case only charges 2-3 times maybe
  2) Case is thick for pocket
  3) No buttons for volume or skip. (Button is a hard press, not a tap.)

They are what I hoped for, and actually sound and seal better.  I have taken them on multiple ocean kayak runs for 2 1/2 hours, flawless functionality, and I can answer calls without pulling out phone in the ocean.  I use them in the gym, 2 hours a shot, never a cut out, isolation is very high (with the correct foamies).  I use them on flights, again, isolation is great and they block out very well, which I prefer.  Have to take one out to have even a short conversation.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great battery life crisp sound,"i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable. For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones. Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool. Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going. But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good customer service,"So this is based on only two uses so far.... First use, I was noticing this weird clicking in and out of the sound-very brief skips. I figured it was because I was out in my yard and slipping in and out of WiFi coverage. Next day, out for a run, nowhere near my house... Same thing. I tried turning off call audio, didn't work. Accidentally realized, then, that moving my phone from my left arm to my right arm totally fixed it (or putting the right ear bud in my left ear and vice versa). Can only guess that since the right his is primary and the left bud is the slave that lefty is interfering with righty? Overall tho, sound quality is pretty decent and they actually stayed in my ear without any fidgeting for the entire room. Minus the weird quirk, I'm satisfied so far. For the price, I think they're decent.
UPDATE: after reading my previous review, they contacted me via email and think I may have received a defective pair. They immediately sent me a replacement. Have not been able to test them out yet, but the customer service had been excellent.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earbuds I've had so far!,"I've been using this product for about a week now, and it's not disappointed! Purchased it a bit tentatively at first, because all the wireless bluetooth earbuds I've purchased so far have been wonky and broke down fairly quickly. I love that the sound has a rich bass, also provides good sound proofing around me. Love the way it fits my ears when applied the right way - they give me sufficient access to information on how to put them on right so that they don't fall off! Used them for a 30 minute run in the rain, and it was water resistant, just like they said! Over all, recommend! I think I might invest in another pair just for running, since it can get quite sweaty and icky (through no fault of the earbuds themselves)!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I did not want to go wireless but Pixel 2 XL has no audio jack.,"I hesitated on longest time on going wireless on my earbuds as I love my wired ones. However, it's super inconvenient to carry the dongle and pulled the trigger on these wireless earbuds since it's got great ratings. And it is well-deserved. Immediately, you can feel the robustness of these earbuds as well as the case it comes with. The sound quality is much better than I was expecting at this price range. With the right ear silicon size, it fits snugly and do no fear it falling out. Definitely recommended.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great purchase,"Love it! The quality is great, especially for the price, and they fit so well in my ear and stay put even when I’m doing particularly intense workouts.

Over all, I would purchase these again and just might for xmas gifts this year.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Harsh sound quality and manual connection process a deal breaker for me.,"I really wanted to like these headphones.  The sound quality could best be described as harsh.  I appreciate that unlike many bluetooth earbuds, including many premium brand offerings, these do get much louder, but it's very tinny and bass reproduction is nearly non-existent.  I'll give it a big plus for the QI enabled charging case, but my number one issue with these headphones is they do no automatically connect to my phone after using.  The headphones will connect to each other, but I have to open bluetooth on my phone and manually pair them for each use.  I have reset the headphones several times and repaired to have the same thing happen.  I am currently using a Pixel 3 XL so it can't be brand related as there is no bloatware on Google Brand Phones.  Use for phone calls is adequate, although I'm told not as good for the other user as the $29 Sound Peats these were intended to replace.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Background Noise,"There is a constant static noise on the left ear bud. Not sure why. Fresh out the box and charged, no damage what so ever yet cannot clear this issue.

Update- I dont understand. I have notified this company of the noise on the left ear bud and received a ""New one""
Please be aware the replacements were dirty so I cleaned them out before inserting to new ear piece. The left ear bud once again has the same scrunchy noise. The right earbud is perfect.

Update 2- I received an email from the company that they were sending me another replacement for the replacement. Now keep in mind I have 1 year warranty.

YESSSS!!,"I have been so jealous of all my friends with the AirPods, but I’m one of those strange Alien-hiding-among-you types who cannot keep the regular Apple cordes headset earbuds in my ears to save my life.

I have been doing a LOT of research and I was going to plunk down $300.00 for the Sennheiser True Wireless earphones, but after doing some digging (yes, I saw ALL of the YouTube videos with people freaking out about the sound quality of the Sennheisers) I realized the charging case for the Sennheisers isn’t wireless charging capable — it doesn’t sit on an induction-charging Qi pad like these (the TOZO T10’s do and that’s a big deal to me. ESPECIALLY in a product called “True Wireless” .

When I saw these TOZO T10’s, at first I just could not believe any so cheap would even be alright. I’ve ordered a lot of stuff from Wish just as a joke, but I don’t want some crazy knockoff product that claims to be one thing or another but isn’t that thing at all. Lets face it on Wish you get a LOT of stuff that claims to be Bluetooth 4.0 that’s really BT 2.0 or something.

I was worried about these Earbuds. But these? These are so great.

They arrived beautifully and simply packaged. Though there were a couple of tiny errors in the English instructions, they were small, and did not in any way make the instructions un-readable. They were the kind of mistakes anybody could make because English is weird.

The Earbuds were already all charged up, or very close to the top anyway, and that was great, I could try them out right away.
In about 1 minute, I was already up and running on my phone.

Then, just for fun I decided to see if I could (since they’re BT5) pair them with my Apple TV because I was watching a horror movie and didn’t want the screams echoing through the house.

BAM! Worked first time, no problem. I sat here and watched a whole movie with the buds in and they didn’t itch, or make my ears sweat I hardly noticed them.

I don’t have fantastic hearing. Its okay, but I’m not the guy who is looking for the ability to hear Luciano Pavarotti’s intestinal bacteria working in my ears, you know? That’s what some people want but for me I just near good volume, decent bass and synch’d sound with video and between the two buds.

All of that was fantastic, they won’t fall out, and they are comfy enough that my French Bulldog even wore one for about 5 minutes (we share a lot) and he is SUPER SENSITIVE about his ears, doesn’t like them touched at all if he can avoid it. He thought they were really great. :-)

The only tiny really insignificant issue I had is that I ordered the “blue” ones, I love the color, but on the blue ones the “R” and “L” indicators are REALLY hard to see. I had to use my phone’s flashlight and a magnifying glass to see which was which. I marked the right one in a place you can’t see when they’re in so I won’t have that problem any more.

All in all I highly recommend these you cannot beat the price, and they work just great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Does not work well with Kindle 2018 generation,"DON'T BUY THIS FOR KINDLE 2018!  The bluetooth does not 'grab on' for kindle (you have to manually configure it every time--which is a real pain.)  In contrast, I own both the Amazon Dot & an Alterola IE600P both of which once initially configured will grab onto the bluetooth without having to delve into the admittedly poorly configured Amazon Kindle setup.

2nd--Voiceview on Amazon Kindle has an annoying 'click' each time a page is turned--which those of us that regularly use voiceview learn to ignore.  The problem with the TOZO T10 is that it apparently interprets the Amazon page turn click as an incoming call and therefore mutes the first few words of a book every time the kindle turns a page--making the TOZO T10 almost unusable with Kindle 2018 generation (Feb 2019 software build).

I also found the TOZO T10 to be a little larger than my Alterola (which I didn't like).  Otherwise I found the TOZO T10 to have a solid build quality, and good value... The increased size wasn't a deal breaker as in my mind other features made up for it (waterproof, lanyard on the charger, good value).  I just couldn't use it with my kindle.

NOTE:  The kindle-click is not present in either the PC kindle program, the Android kindle app (for the Fire or for phones).  It is only present in the new generation kindle voiceview.  So this earbud may work well with kindle apps for phones or other devices--just don't buy it for the 2018 Kindle.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Perfect Earbuds,I mainly use these earbuds while working out. The different size earpieces included  allowed me to find the perfect fit. Paired with no issues right out of the box.

"Great product, out performs other expensive earbuds","I bought these and another earbud (the Jabra Elite Active 65T) around the same time. The Jabra Elite's were $150, 3 times the amount of these headphones, and I found that the T10's outperformed the Jabra's in every category. The T10's are comfortable, loud if needed, have powerful noise cancelling, and amazing sound quality and bass. I workout in a loud commercial gym and need to be focused constantly, and these headphones have no problem keeping distraction away. The bass is incredible, I can feel it in my head and it helps hype me up like crazy. Overall, great product. Save your money on the crazy expensive earbuds and stick with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Excellent product and customer service!,"I love these earbuds! The sound is excellent, and the bass is better than other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve used. I haven’t had any issues with them falling out during workouts, either.
  The customer service is another selling point. Out of the box the earbuds come with a year warranty from TOZO, and when I emailed them and told them I lost one of the earbuds, they said they’d send me a new set! I was very pleasantly surprised with their quick response and willingness to go the extra mile for their customers.
  All in all, I’d highly recommend this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bluetooth for working out. Minor flaws,"These were an interesting experience as they were the first true wireless ear buds I've used. The pairing was simple and quick. The sound quality was average; if your looking for quality compared to powerbeats, these aren't for you. They sit very comfortably in your ears but I sent them back because when pressing the buttons while in my ear it made them very uncomfortable. Would be better if they were switches or buttons around the edge that could be pushed from the sides instead of pushing the device into your ears deeper. The charging case lasted a week and a half from the day I opened it. The battery life is probably the best feauture on this device. Overall I like it but the pressure applied while in ear was bad enough for me to send it back. These ARE suggested for gym use. Waterproof etc ( not the charging case) make for a good workout.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Your search for perfection is over,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I have a hard time getting ear buds to stay in because most are too big for my ears, but with the multiple options for the ear piece these are the perfect fit. They completely block out surrounding sounds and have clear music playing. They are perfect for me because I can wear one if I need to hear surrounding noises or both for complete focus. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for an optimal pair of earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I must have pair of ear buds for all!!,These earbuds are absolutely fantastic.  The charging in the case and wireless ability to recharge the case is perfect for travel.

I am also happy to say that this company's customer service is one of the best. My first pair of T10 earbuds stopped working with my wireless charger, so I reached out to the company. They offered to send me a new set completely free and I could even keep my old ones too. All in all, I am very happy with this company and their products.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left side stopped working after 4 months of use,Left earbud stopped working after 4 months of use.

Quality sound/comfortable,"I recently bought these wireless headphones and I’m already loving them! Some features that sold me on the headphones are they come with a case that doubles as a charger, the quality of the sound, and the sleek design. Definitely worth the $50. I haven’t worn it long enough to test the batter life however I’m not concerned about it considering the case is a charger. So as long as you keep the case charged the headphones will be charged since the headphones automatically charge every time they are put back in the case. Overall really happy with the product and customer service.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What’s the point of hands free if Callers can’t hear you on the other end,"Ok so I would have given these earbuds two stars if it weren’t for the insane amount of time they stay charged. I have a job where I’m on my phone most of the day and these lasted a good 6 hours of continuous use. When I wasn’t actively on the phone I was listening to music or a movie while I worked. Sound quality was pretty good . Pairing was a breeze and I never had any connection issues.

Now for the cons, which may be two of the biggest reasons why I most likely will return them .  I’ve been on the search for the perfect pair of ear buds for my needs. These came so close !!’ I would sacrifice a not so stellar battery life for these two issues to have not been issues.
First, like other reviewers have said the ear buds are too big for the ears (I guess unless you have big ears) mine did come with different size earpieces and none of the sizes made the earbuds fit any better. It felt like constantly that they were going to fall out of my ears, which at one point the right one did while I was cooking and fell into a pan of chicken right into the chicken drippings. Thank God it still worked after that. The other issue which is a non negotiable for me was every caller on the other end of the phone said they had trouble or could not hear me. Which leads me to think that the fact that the earbuds being too big is what plays a part in this ; by not fitting properly in the ears. When I would carefully put my fingers to the edges of the earbuds and hold it into my ear, the caller would say they could hear me better.

As a crisis intervention nurse and Having a job where I’m on the phone most of the day it is so important for people to be able to hear me and for me to have the convenience of hands free.

I could even live with the issue of the earbuds being too big . Does anyone have a fix for the sound issue ? If not I’m afraid I will return these .",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"while great sound, kept losing connection","The unit kept losing connection under certain circumstances. While they worked great at home, indoors, once i went outside on a bright, sunny and a bit windy day, the left bud kept losing connection, then faded back in within 3-5 seconds. I synced them with a different phone and the same thing occured.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Product Frequently Cuts Out,"Pros - Nice charging case. Comfortable. Good Sound.
Cons - Frequently cuts out to an annoying degree

I bought these to use at the gym. I saw poor reviews about this issue but all the 5 star reviews convinced me it was probably a fluke, Fast forward to the day after I received them receiving an email offering a free Qi charger in exchange for a 5 star review. Makes sense now. I can't in good faith give these a good review as they are distracting to listen to and I'll be returning the product after a week of use as I am unsatisfied with them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not for my ear shape,"I have owned 2-3 different pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds and have found that the only way to get any sort of bass response is the have them fit snug into the ear canal to 'lock' them into place.  It made no difference  what size rubber adapter I used, due to they design they would not lock into place.  I ended up returning them with no hassle from TOZO.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Loved them for a short time.,"I absolutely love these headphones. The sound is amazing. They do not hurt my ears like others I've tried. They're easy to use. Mic works great on calls. Cant say about the waterproof function yet. If I'm cleaning around the house or something while using them I only wear one, because they absolutely are noise cancelling and I couldn't hear my kids otherwise. Definitely recommend.

Editing my review. I've been using these headphones regularly, I'm impressed with the sound. However, now only one will connect at a time. I dont know why or what happened. I've reset them. Tried everything in the manual. I'm exchanging them for a new pair.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound quality great for the price!,Was looking for truly wireless headphones and after doing my research ending up purchasing these.  I have to say I was really impressed with the sound.

Tozo T10’s are the real deal!,Love this product! I was skeptical before I purchased because of the price but so glad I did. When they arrived the set up was super easy and the sound quality was amazing . I was surprised how loud the volume can go all while keeping crystal clear audio (with no buzzing or cracking) .  The bass is also impressive. I have previously purchased many other wireless earbuds in the $100 -$200 range and the Tozo T10’s performance as good or better for a fraction of the price.  These are also water proof and come with Bluetooth 5.0. My others I paid close to $200 are not. The Tozo T10’s are the real deal! Will most definitely buy again.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Awesome in everyway, except the most important feature","UPDATE 2 -----
I received the replacement headphones quickly thanks to their prompt service. For whatever reason I still have the same issue where the left earbud loses connectivity. It's really awful in some situations, other times, it is fine. It seems to occur more outside. I've tried everything to get it to work correctly. Turning off powersaver on my phone, etc. etc. Great service but the product just needs to be improved so that it works all the time.
UPDATE-----
Customer service contacted me and offered a free replacement. Great job on their part to stand behind the product. I will update again once I receive the replacement.  -------

These headphones are so awesome. Great sound, great price, comfortable, don't fall out... except they constantly lose the bluetooth connection! It is so aggravating. they constantly cut in and out anytime you move. This is less than ideal when you use them for working out. sitting still at a desk they seem to be ok, but anytime you get up and move around they immediately start crackling and loosing connection. The right ear stays connected ok, but the left is horrible. I believe the left is just a bluetooth slave to the right. This is to bad since they are friggin awesome otherwise. I'm going to have to return and keep looking.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"A $50 surprise - powerful, crisp and well worth it","There are quite a few wireless buds available online and, like other reviews, I wasn’t sure which would be a good alternative to high priced options. I selected the TOZO 10 based on the literal thousands of reviews and good feedback. These things are great! The packaging is professional, warranty is a simple QR code and then in a few clicks you’re registered. The devices fit perfectly and the charger is pretty unique as it doubles a carrier and comes with a lanyard. If you’re going to spend $50, these are the ones to spend it on. You could spend more but honestly, you’re going to get a very good experience with these and the customer service is excellent from a thank you acknowledgment to quick receipt when you submit the warranty. You’re going to like these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
👎🏽,"I bought these wireless earbuds so that I can exercise with them. In terms of lifting and an exercises, they typically hold up pretty well. Now, running is where I get annoyed with them. While running at a really fast speed, the last thing I want to do is push them into my ear every time I feel them falling out. And on top of that, they have a bad battery life. They are constantly dying at the most inconvenient times, even after I charge fully and see that the battery level is high on them. Honestly I was so exited to use these and am just disappointed.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Gym Earbuds,"I was surprised by how well they've performed at the gym. They don't move at all and I can get a solid 3 hours of playback while on med/high volume, which is more than enough. The case charges the the earbuds quickly so it's non-issue if I need to use them throughout day. Sound quality is great for the gym, it's loud without being distorted and the bass kicks just right. With the right size ear buds and music on, it basically blocks out all outside noise. All in all, I'm glad I purchased them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid Bluetooth Earbuds,"I'm a big fan of these earbuds.  The Apple earbuds don't stay in my ears plus they are expensive.  These stay in my ears and are comfortable to wear.  They come with 4 different sizes of rubber caps so there should be a size for everyone.  I use mine to listen to music and watch videos and the sound is very good.  I'm sure there are better sounding earbuds out there, but for the price these are hard to beat.  I saw a lot of reviews saying that you can't use these 1 at a time so let me be clear that you absolutely can.  If I use one long enough to run the battery down I put it back in the case and get the other one out.  While I'm listening using the second earbud the first one is charging in the case.  You could use them all day like this.

There are a couple of things that I don't like about them but they aren't big enough problems to take away a star.  Both of them are due to bulk.  Each earbud sticks out of your ear so they're not very comfortable to wear laying on your side.  I don't do that much so it's not a big problem for me.  The other bulky issue is the case.  If you're familiar with the case that comes with the Apple earbuds this one is about twice the size.  Again, not a huge issue for me but if you plan on putting it in your pocket it's fairly big.  It's about 3.25 inches long & 1.25 inches wide & 1.25 inches tall.

If I had to buy another set of bluetooth earbuds I'd buy these again.  They are comfortable to wear, they charge in the case and they sound great.  I also like that you can see through the top of the case when you're charging it or if the earbuds are charging in it.  You don't have to open the top to see if either the case or the earbuds are charging.  I also like that there are magnets that hold the top closed as well as the ones that keep the earbuds secure in the case.

Overall, there are probably better earbuds out there but for the price these are hard to beat.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good for sports, not so good for critical listening","First off, this is a very handy set of earphones for riding the bike trainer. I haven't tried them outdoors, nor am I likely to just because I want to hear cars coming up behind me.
That said, I also tried them for just plain music listening and found they have a curious fade in/ fade out effect in silent parts of music.  This was too distracting.

Good quality Bluetooth earbuds...,"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.

Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.

The sound is surprisingly very good quality and with good base. If it sounds too thin & tinny initially, it’s a sign that the buds are not properly positioned in the ear.

I tried all the included rubber-tip fittings and settled in on the medium. The directions are ambiguous at times and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation, but it easy to figure out and they have a very responsive support team. I contacted them and was linked to several pages and videos that were very helpful.

I like the product and can now listen to my Kindle books without disturbing others. Connecting with iPhone/iPad was easy. The charging unit is small enough to carry in my pocket and comes with a lanyard so you can hang around your neck. Nice little compact unit.

All in all a nice addition to my pile of technology... :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent cheaper alternative to AirPods,"Compared to apples AirPods:

1. left / right channels cut in and out more frequently.

"So Far, So Good with an update","These are my first wireless earbuds. In my case, I will primarily be using them to listen to spoken voice podcasts, therefore sound quality may not be as critical for me as for those who want to use them for music. I can also get by with a minimum set of touch functions to pause and play podcasts and answer/disconnect phone calls.

Pairing with my iPhone went very smoothly. I'm pleased that there are several sets of different pads as I plan to purchase another pair for my spouse should these work as well as I think they will.

The packaging is very good. The instructions come in multiple languages. The English translation is okay but lacks the subtlety of a native speaker; not a big deal. However, the diagram on the one page ""wearing steps"" is confusing, with the arrows seemingly given contrary advice on how to rotate the buds.

UPDATE: October 10, 2019
Having used these for several weeks I have some observations to add to the review.
- The pods frequently seem to lose synchronization with one another, resulting in echo. This sometimes clears up on its own, but the surest way to cure it is to reset the buds following the directions in the manual that comes with them.
- Similarly, the pods will also lose connection with the audio itself, leading to pauses in playback. This tends to last for about 15 seconds and then goes back to normal.
- As stated previously, I mostly listen to podcasts. The app I use is Overcast. I have found the same playback issues mentioned above using Apple Podcasts. The audio is already downloaded, so it is not being streamed from the cloud while listening.
- Battery life is good for both the pods and the charging case. No complaints thus far for how I use them.
- An alternative means of dealing with the echo problem that works well with podcasts is to simply turn off the left earbud and put it away. Mono is fine for spoken word.
- I have found that the earbuds have a tendency to fall out of my ears unless I really screw them into my ear channels using a back and forth motion, i.e. clockwise and counter-clockwise. Doing so will seat them firmly but also reduce ambient sound from the outside world so be careful when in areas where you need to have awareness of your surroundings to be safe.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, good fit, don't fall out","This replaced a set with the cord between them. This is way, way better. I use these mostly while doing yard work. My concern was them falling out but I have had zero issues. Comes with multiple size rubber pieces so you can get the right size.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value!,"I am very happy with the ergonomic fit and sound quality of these headphones. The battery life is solid for Bluetooth headphones and they are fairly quick to pair to devices. These are a great value for the price point. I purchased these for swimming and have not tried them in the pool yet, but my initial impression is very promising! The noise cancellation is also very good. Many people cannot even tell that I am wearing headphones and get confused when I can't hear them!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound. Slow auto-pair.,"Pros:
Nice sound for the price
Last longer than 3 hours
Quick recharge
Relatively comfortable in ears (I’ve worn them for 3.5 hours straight, and they didn’t bother me.)

Con:
Takes at least 30 seconds (to a minute) to search and auto-pair my iPhone, so I manually pair them every single time. This is kind of a pain; wish they paired much quicker.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall very solid wireless earbuds,"Pros: -Above average sound quality, good bass quality
- Comfortable feel, even when prolonged usage
- Easy to connect, after first connection attempt it is automatic when you remove them from the charger case
- Battery life is very good, re-charges quickly

Cons: - If you decide to pair one earbud at a time and then pair the other earbud after, it will disconnect the previous earbud you were listening to and only the second earbud will connect. To fix this just shut off both and turn them on simultaneously, not a deal breaker.
- Sometimes the earbuds sound would fade in and out when I am exercising since my phone is on the move, slightly annoying but nothing drastic.

Overall: Worth the price, great quality material and sound, easy to use.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound quality blew me away.,"These are a nice pair of truly wireless earbuds. The sound quality is surprisingly excellent. Noise cancellation is great, especially if you use the correct earbuds. Very easy to pair and wireless charging is convenient. My favorite feature is the four blue lights in the case that tell you how charged the case is. No more guessing!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Edit: A few months in and the left earpiece has major issues,"I bought these TOZO t10 wireless earbuds as part of a lightning deal, so they were $10 off. I had been wanting wireless earbuds for a while, but was hesitant. I didn't want to buy an expensive pair and end up losing them, and quality can be so hit or miss on less expensive products. I took a chance on these, however, and I was not disappointed! The sound quality is excellent, and the bass is nice and deep and rich. They are also totally waterproof! I've worn them in the shower a few times now when I didn't want to interrupt my podcast, and no issues. The battery lasts a decent time, and the case is conveniently sized and quality material. Plus, after I purchased the earbuds, the company emailed and offered to ship me a free wireless charging plate to thank me for my purchase! Seriously, this was overall a great purchase, 10/10 would recommend.

Edit: I haven't even owned these earbuds for six months and I am having issues. I have never dropped them or in any way damaged them, and I consistently keep them charged. I have never worn them in a pool or body of water and only tried them in the shower twice without issues. However, over the last couple of months I have been having issues with connectivity and sound. The left earbud in particular cuts out, and sometimes it won't turn on at all, for no apparent reason. I am so upset, because I absolutely loved the earbuds! For the sound quality they are an excellent price, and they do a great job of cancelling out background noise even though that isn't the primary function. I would buy another pair, but I don't want to spend the money if they are just going to malfunction again after a few months. As much as I hate to say it, stay away from these. Hopefully my pair were just a fluke, but I don't know if I would take the chance.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Airpods are better,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative, but I listen to music all day at work and it was getting really annoying having to constantly charge these earbuds and to also constantly charge the charging case.  Plus it started getting staticky/pauses during music as if it were losing connection.  I didn't want to get into the hype of the Airpods, but I tried a friend's out and loved it.  I'm able to listen to my music a whole lot longer without having to charge them.  These earbuds are good if you want a cheaper alternative, and I think they do a better job of canceling out noises if that's important to you.

Edit:  Updated to 5 stars purely for their great customer service.  They really try to make the buying experience great and was willing to send me new earbuds to try out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, short battery life.","I've had the TAZO 10T bluetooth earbuds for 3 months now. They are great! Here is a summary:
pro
+ great sound, good bass, separation and dynamic range
+ solid charging case w/magnetic
+ good fit, solid construction
+ water proof
cons
- short < 4 hour charge
- short bluetooth range (not enough to reach across the pool for lap swimming)
- plastic finish dried out after use in the pool
- charge USB is B-type not C-type",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice sounding ear buds,"These earbuds sound pretty good. The pairing takes a little while to get used to, but after some trial and error I was able to use either the left or the right (I like to use only one ear bud at a time). Overall I'm pretty happy with these, though I should note at the minimum volume on a Samsung Galaxy 7 these seem a little bit loud, but maybe that's something else I need to get used to.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love it,"great sound, very comfortable, I think that for the price is a good investment, the battery is durable.  I have only felt a problem in them, and that is that in certain movements of the head you lose the connection between it and you stay listening to only one, the same happens when you cover one of them with your hand, the connection is lost, but it is something  It does not take more than two seconds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bluetooth Earbuds for Price,"I had recently been gifted a pair of cheap bluetooth earbuds and they broke only after a few weeks. I didn’t want to spend $200+ on something like AirPods, so I decided to find something more budget friendly. Being only $50, I was a bit skeptical on how long these earbuds would last and how well they would perform. However, they seem to be of good quality. I originally wanted something that would hook over my ears, but these seem to stay in just fine without the hooks (they also look more stylish). The different sized caps were nice because I could experiment with them to see which one would hold my earbuds in the best. I took these on a run and they stayed in just fine. I didn’t purchase these because they were waterproof, but I can say that they continued to work well when covered in some sweat. Pairing the earbuds takes me usually 15 seconds or less. I appreciate the little carrying/charging case that comes with the earbuds. It makes charging them so much more convenient. It feels kinda cool how they stay in the case magnetically. I’m not much of an audiophile, but I think that the sound is very good overall. There’s not much bass, but it is something I don’t really mind. I was kinda surprised how well these little earbuds block out sound and reduce noise. Maybe not at the level of headphones, but much better than most earbuds. Overall, the quality of these earbuds are very good for the price. They do exactly what I wanted them to do. The one year warranty is nice too. Highly recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Did not like,"They do not stay in my ear, even after I changed the earbud size. I do not like that I can not do anything with them. The volume can't be adjusted, I can not start or end my calls, nor can I do anything with my music. I thought ""hands free"" was the point.... if I still have to have my phone in my hand to do everything then that's pointless to me.  I wore these one day and then ordered something else.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pairing is too difficult /  POOR technical support,"I do not recommend this product to anyone, pairing with any Bluetooth device is too difficult, I tried to pair it with three different Smartphones, and it was really too complicated, when I finally did it, just with one of them (Left) the sound is not as good as I expected, it's only acceptable. The seller only gave me a very vague answer when I wanted to ask for help with the pairing. Never again did the seller give me any answers, therefore I had to ask for the money back, which seems to take more than three weeks. Very bad seller, very poor technical support, and the product is not of very good manufacturing quality. Not recommended ... PLEASE!!!!.. Do not buy this product.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for all activities of a retired guy.,"Yes, for my exercise bike, outdoor bike, cutting the grass, hiking, cooking, all the activities I fill my retired days with.

WOW! WONDERFUL BASS EASY TO USE PRODUCT.,"These TOZO T10 are phenomenal. I am a UPS driver for 32 years with a noisy truck and 100's of customers calling all day. For safety reasons I need to have both hands on the steering wheel (not to mention it's the law in Florida). TOZO T10 provides  the simplicity of popping them out of the case and they connect. In addition, I can alternate each earbud throughout the day  so my 12 hour day is never without a earbud. Moreover, the bass is outstanding for any genre  of music and listen time is consistently five hours or more even  with intermittent  phone calls . If the TOZO T10  runs low i can charge it back up about 15 mins for the 30 minute  train ride home. Great Product!!.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Decent, but issues getting a refund if you try to return them.","I bought these to have something to use while working that was wireless and wouldn’t get in the way. I used them for about two days before i decided that they were not for me because of how they fit in my ear. The sound quality wasn’t bad But I expected more for $50, kinda crackly when you turned them up to anything above half way to full volume. The noise cancellation was good, but that might have been because even with the smallest size of earbud that came with it, the fit was too tight and cause too much discomfort to keep using. I didn’t have them long enough to really get a feel for the battery life. But if you considering buying these, make sure they are what you want. Because I returned them over 2 weeks ago and I still haven’t gotten a refund. I can’t even track the refund through amazon anymore. So just be sure that you have no interest in getting your money back if you have any issues.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and features for a great price.,"Great low end from these.  Was very surprised at the bass these put out.  I primarily listen to rock, hard rock and metal and these are great for it.  Love the ability to charge on wireless qi charge pad.  Include 3 additional ear bud sizes so you should be able to find one to fit correctly.  Pairing is super easy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth in the long term,"First of all the earbud seems to be a bit big. So when you have it in the ear it's like this awkward piece out of your ear. They also fit tight in the ear which after a while makes your ear hurt. Do me a favor and save some time and money by not buying this product and getting others. I decided to buy because of the rating and what everyone was saying, but it's all false. At last, you get what you pay for...right?",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Get these earbuds!,Ok. I read the reviews before buying these because I had a bad buy not too long ago. All the negative reviews are such crap. Unless I was fortunate enough to get a good pair. These earbuds are great. I wear them every. Single. Day. I wear them while I run. They do not fall out(make sure you size the earbud cushion). These are definitely worth the money. Oh! And they hold a charge for 4 plus hours!!!!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice ear buds,"I was skeptical when I ordered these because they don't hook over your ear. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality great highs and good lows to mid range.  The call quality is pretty good as well. I would give 5 stars but they didn't come with different rubber insert options for the part that goes into your ears. As is, they were too big to stay put. I took parts for another set I had to make work but still have issues keeping them in place. But the recharge case is great and I enjoy that when I wear just one ear bud I don't have the other swinging around my neck. I would buy these again if I had to replace them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Great Bass, that's about it.","Pros:
- Crazy bass!
- Fit nicely in your ears.
- Sturdy and magnetic case

Cons:
- Bass is overpowering for any genre that's not EDM (slow or fast)
- Very difficult to turn off; you have to push so hard to turn the headphones off that you really have to take them out of your ears.
- Does not hold charge well.
- No EQ app (to at the very least turn down the bass; the android native EQ does not really work)
- Cannot listen to none-slave bud while the other is off",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good quality, terrible battery life","The sound quality is great for this product. I really enjoyed using them; however, the battery life was terrible. It does not accomplish what it boasts. After about 90 minutes of use, they need to be charged, and after one full charge, the charger itself needs to be recharged. The frequency of charging necessary makes this product to inconvenient for regular use. I am returning these to use a better brand.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not small enough,Unfortunately even the smallest tips were too big for my ears so I wasn’t able to get the full experience of wearing the buds. The sound quality seemed to be ok as well as the noise cancellation but again since I wasn’t able to get the full experience I can’t really vouch for the product. Every time I would move around the buds would fall out.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Headset,"The company is fantastic, I had some minor issue with my first order, they took care of the issue and send me a new one. I tested for several weeks making calls which works flawlessly, plus it was canceling outside noise too. Listening to music is awesome, you can hear every sounds of instruments.

Low-cost high-quality workout earbuds!,"These are incredible earphones. I use them in the gym and I sweat A TON!!!! I have long workouts. I begin by lifting, then do intense cardio. They stay in my ears the whole time and have great sound for the price.

The charging case is small and solid, and the earphones have a good battery life.

Only two negatives:
1) The range isn’t very far. It starts cutting out at about 10 meters.
2) The call quality for the person I’m talking with isn’t high. People say the sound gets really quiet sometimes, and the audio is crackly.

Otherwise, 5/5. Couldn’t be happier with these earphones so far, and the company has great customer service.

Solid for the price. Great choice for those who don't want to spend big bucks.,"Owned these for several months, pretty happy with them. Battery life is reasonable, considering the size. The charging case is great, holds charge for a long time and recharges the earbuds multiple times before needing to be recharged itself. They fit my ears just fine, and stay in place without issue.

One minor complaint is the length of time it takes for them to automatically connect when you turn them on. It's like 20-30s sometimes. Meanwhile, I have other bluetooth audio devices that connect almost instantly upon turning them on. Worth noting that these will connect instantly when you open your phone's BT settings and actually TELL it to connect to them - so it's not like they're just slow to connect, across the board - they just take their sweet time doing the auto-connect-to-the-last-device routine. Not a dealbreaker though, just a minor annoyance.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I own another brand for w I paid over $350 for and this set of Tozo T10 earbuds is proof positive that the amount paid has nothing to do with performance.

Excellent product minus no volume control,"Reason for reducing 1 star is it has no volume control function on the ear buds. Now why is it important? It is coz u may not always have easy access to device it is connected to control volume.

Otherwise, it's a great product, fits decently well, sounds great including bass is very good.

I haven't used it much for calls but I find it not so convenient for calls and mostly other party has complained on not hearing me properly. However, good things is both left n right buds have mic on them so u can use any one for taking calls.

Battery back up has been decent so far. Case ain't that great looking and but it okay. It wud have been great if case shows up current charge indicator whenever the lid is opened or closed or earbuds are placed in or taken out.

Great Ear Buds,"This in my first new ear buds in 10 years, so I went to wireless.  They are reliable so far and work consistently.

GREAT value!  You wont find a better pair for the price!,Great product for the price.  Very lightweight and comfortable in your ear these earbuds are a great value.  I personally like more bass but that is the drummer in me....  I really like the storage case that also charges them each time you are done.  I cant wait to try the wireless charging pad for the case that should make it even better!!!  Buy NOW you wont be disappointed....,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"I've tried them all, and these are the best","These are the 6th pair of wireless earbuds that I've purchased and these are my favorite.  Better than the following:

1. Galaxy Buds
2. J-Buds True Wireless
3. Ankar Soundcore
4.  1MORE True Wireless
5. Jabra Elite 65t

Ridiculous volume, great bass, comfy fit, fantastic charging and unfettered by any amount of sweat I throw at them during intense workouts.  Don't waste your time with other ear buds, these are the ones that you want, especially for $50.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfy fit and great sound.,Very impressed with the quality and the ease of set up I love the case and it’s fantastic that they can charge wireless. I’m actually quite impressed with the product my expectations are surpassed.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds Great,I really like these earbuds and I plan on purchasing a second pair.  I was really impressed with the bass. The reason I'm purchasing a second pair is because I have two phones.  A personal and a work phone. I would have given it 5 stars if it had two profiles to be able to connect two different phones to the same earbuds without having to unpair and then pair each time for different phones.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great deal and even better performance,"Very pleased with these ! I didn’t expect them to work as well as they do! Easy fit, great sound quality, strong battery life, and the case is great to carry. I got these mainly for the gym as ear buds whet wires often cause distraction while working out. I’ve been using these for a while both at the gym and at home- and it’s been great. At first it felt strange to have wireless ear buds but it’s an easy adjustment. I also got these because I don’t trust apple’s as I feel they’ll fall out of my ear. These will NOT fall. Very good fit and it comes with changeable earbud heads so you get the right fit. Highly recommend not only for performance but for price point. I actually want to get my family these too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Holds a good charge,"This is a good product overall for the most part;A couple things i dont like: it doesn't stay in my ears as well at least on my right ear, but it seems to stay well on the left. The other thing I'm not to impress with is the noise cancellation. I like the fact its light weight. Because it's my first in-ear set I can't really make a comparison to any others but so far I'm enjoying it. One more thing I can boast about in regards to this set is it holds a charge really well.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Product wouldn't stay paired - left side intermittent operation,"I really wanted this product to work.  The sound was amazing, but on the first set, the left side would intermittently stop working...ever few seconds.  So back to the seller they went.  Second set, no luck - same issue.  The left side would work for a few seconds, then stop working, then work, then stop.  Very maddening.  I tried re-pairing the set, resetting them, all the recommendations.  No luck.  So back went the second set.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product at a great price-point,"Great product, and great price point. I researched several wireless earbuds, and quickly realized I could spend a lot of money if I wanted to. Ordered these with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. They stayed put in my ears on my run, and the charging/carrying case is nice. I was not concerned about sound quality, but they sound good to me, so bonus on that. My priority was comfort and ease of use during fitness...win, win.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, long battery life","Love these little suckers! The sound really is in both pods making music so much better to listen to. Battery life is great too; I use mine for about an hour or two a day and only have to charge every five-six days. They stay in ear pretty well, but little ""wings"" on around the edges might help keep them in-ear better. This could also be because I have smaller ears and the pods don't sit all the way in - which is probably also why noise cancelling isn't so great for me. Minor inconveniences for the sound quality and battery life though.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Sound Quality,"Amazing sound quality and a complete steal for 50$. I had a little trouble with the earbuds staying in at first, but once I changed out the heads with smaller earbuds (provided with purchase) I have had no problems.

Best Sounding Earbuds Ever!!!!,"These are the best sounding earbuds I've ever had, wireless or wired!  They even sound better than over the ear headphones!  The bass response is fantastic!  I took them out of the box and out of the case and they powered on super fast and went immediately into pairing mode where I saw them on my Bluetooth list on my iPhone 8 Plus and immediately paired them.  I have been using them outside in 90+ degree temperatures while running string trimmers, lawn mowers, etc.... and have not had one minute's trouble with them.  Once I put these in my ears the outside world just goes away!!!  You can't beat the quality at this price point.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I don't generally review products but these ear buds are worth it!!,"I have been having problems with wired earphones. For some reason, they quit working due to the plug getting bent or damaged. Also, the hanging cord is a hassle when it gets caught on something and they get pulled out. I purchased these Ear Buds for two reasons. They were an Amazon Choice product and the reviews were very positive. I was not disappointed! They pair easy initially and once paired, you take them out of the charging case and they link up with each other and pair with my Samsung Galaxy S9+ phone seamlessly. Besides excellent sound quality, these buds last and last and last! When I take them off, I pop them back in the case and they are ready to go when I take them back out. The wireless charging is pretty sweet as well! No plugging in this case. I keep a wireless charger on my desk and just set it down and I am good to go! In summary, you won't go wrong with these buds. Five stars all the way!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great in ear headphones,"I own two other Bluetooth in ear headsets, one a major brand that is way over priced and one a bargain brand that is a good value with “good enough” sound. This pair sounds better than the Beats, is priced near the bargains, is waterproof, has a great case so I won’t lose them, and the case charges wirelessly. What’s not to love? Highly recommend.
The ONLY thing I wish is that they would just turn off when out of battery. I wear them while falling asleep a lot. During the night they wake me up to tell me the batteries are exhausted and I have to put them back in the charging case to shut them up.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Big disappointment,"I have been looking for wireless bluetooth ear buds for some time now. The ones with a neck thing with the wires going to the earpiece has been a bother as I constantly snag them in some way which eventually results in them being non-working on one side or the other. So, I finally took the plunge and bought these based on a glowing review in an article from airwatchdog. Super disappointment especially for the price.

Let's start with the physical product. This set does not come with additional rubber ear pieces so I cannot change to the size I need for my ears. They became painful to wear in no time. They are a bit bulky and I assume since there was no ear piece options, that would explain why it was hard to keep them in my ears.

Next, the sound quality was not good. This could be due to not having the correct ear piece size. However when I pressed them into my ears to hear what I expected to be great sound, this was not the case. The sound was rather weak on the bass. They sounded really cheap. I do admit when someone was talking to me I could not hear them talking even though they weren't fitting well.

Connectivity is a huge issue. They are easy to pair with devices. That's the only good thing I can say. There are a couple of problems to mention here. One is staying connected to a device after you've paired them with multiple devices. For me this was my pc and my iPhone. I would be listening to my phone and as soon as I turned on my pc or walked by it, the headphones would jump to the pc and dump my phone. The other problem is using only one earpiece. When I need to wear only one, I finally figured out that I had to take them both out of the charging storage box at the same time, let them pair to each other, then sometimes I had to lay the one I didn't want on the desk because if I put it back in the box the one in my ear would beep at me. Sometimes it wouldn't.

So overall, I am very unhappy and will be returning them. I tried using them for a couple of days and it isn't worth the hassle. I guess I will keep with the older wired bluetooth style because they can stay connected to the right device, provide great sound, last longer from a charge, and are comfortable.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Was weary of all the 5 star reviews,"But damn, these are a legit pair of ear buds. I can't do Air Pods, as much as I wanted to, my huge head and ears just werent a good fit. These things fit perfectly with the large buds attached. Pairing was easy right out of the box. Now, I'm all about sound quality. I love full , clear sound. I primarily listen to EDM and Hip Hop, so bass is very important. These things bump harder in my ear than my GF's Beats Studio 3's. Seriously, she nor I could believe it. I use the spotify app and turn on the equalizer to make some small adjustments to the lows and highs, and they sound even better. Overall for this price, I can't believe the quality. Hopefully these lasts seeing as I've just received them today and have only had one trip to the gym to test drive them. The noise cancelling effect is borderline unsafe. I could not hear my gf talking while sitting directly next to me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for the money!,"These have good options for fit with the various ear bud fittings.  The fit helps with the sound and blocking out unwanted noise.  The sound quality is very good for the value, both on the highs and lows.  They pair up instantly when turned on and I have had no problems with the audio cutting out on me.  The charging is quick and battery life is decent but the charging dock could be a bit smaller since it gets bulky in a pocket.  Much better than any wired option out there!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product for the price,"I had resisted paying over 100 dollars for ear buds and have been looking for an alternative. I purchased these 3 weeks ago and they are excellent. The charging case works very well and they pair seamlessly, you will hear the right ear bud search for the left for about 30 seconds if you are using just one, but then it stops. Sound quality is excellent and the charging case is great. Call quality is acceptable. These are a great value for something that works very well. I had a question and the company was super responsive, overall a great buy",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exceptional Headphones for the Price,"These are great headphones, especially for the price. The sound quality is excellent (particularlyif you like bass) and they are comfortable in the ear. The microphone picked up my voice with no issues and the quality of the reception is excellent.

My one quibble would be that it seems like the battery charge doesn't hold as well as I'd hope, but that is probably a consequence of how much power and quality is packed into these headphones.

Company Sent me a replacement to the first ones,Update The Company sent me a free set of earbuds as the ones I had at first were bad and fell within there warranty period. The Overall Quality of customer service was great. The earbuds themselves still need a bit of adjustment made to improve the product but the replacement pair they sent work as described on there listing. The replacement pair is lot better then the fist set I had received. The experience has changed my opinion of the product going from 1 star to 5 star. I will not gig them on the overall quality of the product because you get what you paid for a set of Bluetooth earbuds that are waterproof with in there specs. I would buy products from this company in the future knowing that they will do what is right to fix any issues for which are covered under warranty.

Definitely worth the price and great bonus that they're water proof.,"I use these for just everyday general use and so far everything been great. I haven't had any problems with them.
There's not really anything I can say that's bad about these. The setup when you can them out of the box is super straight forward and they work right away.
 They fit very snugly in my ears as I've even used them while going to sleep. I don't really have issues with wearing these for hours that you may get from other kinds of earbuds.
The sound quality is pretty good and they're not wrong when they say there's some bass behind these little buds.
I've used these in the shower before too and they work great and had no issues with them even after.

Great earbuds but not for my ears,"Ok this is an update about this product, as i statetd nothing is change about sound...however they did not stays in my ears due the small canal i try every size of silicone and foam, espacially when im chuwing something in my mouth they fall off easally , so it is not the device it just me so decide to return them.
First the sound qualilty is awesome for the price nice base, trible...they sound much better and louder then Jabra active at $180, call quality i am not sure yet, ill update on that, for the fitting i have small ear canal so staying still working on it , but the main thing is the sound is very rich and if you want to customize that get the poweramp app for android you want regret it.
Update on the fittting, i have a hard time to keep them on my ears , they slip out easally from my ears , i try a different fitting from another brand and no luck, now i order a memory foam fitting and hopefully will work(cost $20 more)... i will update on that it my hepl some buyers .",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good quality for a good price,"I purchased these headphones on a flash sale, so I got them at a reduced price. I figured, even if I don't like them, they weren't that much. I haven’t had them very long, but I’ve been surprisingly pleased with them.

So far, I’ve used them mainly at my office to watch Netflix during my lunch break. I have on a couple occasions used them for a few hours without any problems with the batteries running out. I really like that the carrying case holds a reserve charge to recharge the headphones when put back in.

I have never been able to comfortably wear a pair of Apple headphones, so I always avoid those kinds of earbuds. So far, they have been comfortable to wear. I haven’t had a chance to wear them to workout yet. So, I can’t speak to how well they stay in once I get moving. However, given the snugness of the fit with the current buds I have on them (the original pair that came attached), they feel pretty secure. I don’t foresee them coming out.

One of the things that initially drew my attention to these headphones was the IPX8 rating. While I do swim quite a bit, I don’t think I will be attempting to swim with them though. Bluetooth doesn’t work well in water. However, I do have to work outside sometimes in the rain. So, it will be nice that I don’t have to quickly put them away.

For the most part, I’m happy with the sound quality. I prefer more of a flat response, so I find them to be a little bass heavy. But that also means I was surprised at how much bass they actually put out. (Free tip: if you are using Spotify on your iPhone, there is an EQ feature so you can adjust the lower end if it’s too much.) Again, I’ve used them mostly for Netflix, so I haven’t noticed it as much. I was very surprised at how loud they can get.

The sound quality of the mic is about what you’d expect from a pair of headphones. They work well enough to communicate. Just don’t expect to record vocals for your next platinum selling album with them.

The Bluetooth is very quick to connect to my computer. They are usually connected by the time I can even get them in my ears. Even with the Bluetooth 5.0, there is some latency though. But, that is to be expected. It would be nice if they had aptX to help with that. However, given the low price, how new aptX is, being Bluetooth 5.0, and having an IPX8 rating, I can hardly expect that.

I really like the case. It is somewhat bulky, but that’s the tradeoff to have a case that provides a reserve charge for your earbuds. I also liked that the cover is slightly transparent so I can see the battery level without having to open it. I also love that the case is equipped with Qi charging capabilities. I would say that the charging cable, measuring in at just over 12 inches, is really short. But, again, at this price, I can hardly fault them for not making it any longer. And, it’s not like you’re going to need them plugged in while you’re using them.

Bottom line, I don’t think you’re going to find a better pair of earbuds with as many features at a better price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
An Earbud Should Remain in the Ear and Not Fall off,"It is so sad that my earbud does not remain in my ear. I am suppose to walk around and talk, exercise and talk or listen to music, however, this product fails woefully on all those counts. The thing has fallen from my ear so many times, that I no longer use it. Cant I cook and just listen to a nice instrumental? Well....Yes, except it falls from my ear every time.

Tozo T10 - Great Earbuds for a Great Price!,"I've had these for about 2 weeks now and was pleasantly surprised at how much I like them!

I have worked out in them 4 or 5 times.  The range is very good and more importantly they stay in my ear.  The earbuds come with 4 different size tips and once you find the correct size, they are comfortable and stable in your ear.  I also tend to sweat quite a bit and have had no issues with moisture affecting the earbuds.

Today I traveled with them - 3 flights over a 12 hour period.  I used them for the first flight which was 3 hours long, put them back in the case, and when I took them out again for flight #2, they were fully charged.  I used them for the next flight (2 hours) and again put them back in the case and they were fully charged for flight #3.

PROS:

Design - Plastic surface very smooth, and made of strong materials.

Connections- wireless connectivity it does what it says in the manual, hassle-free, i try to used in my Samsung S9+, Huawei phone, and my bluetooth TX/RX connected in my TV.

Sounds Quality - Perfect for watching movies
You really notice the surround sounds, even for the music more into acoustic sounds its really good for the eardrum higly recommend it.

Wireless charger- 100% true fast charging.

Waterproof - i have tried only once, taking a bath Iistening to my fav music, but so far still working, still charging wow! Amazing huh! now, i'm excited again to take a bath tom. 😊

CONS:
- when i'm  about to start watching movie in my room , and I dimmed the lights I struggled with finding which one goes to the right and vice versa. It would be good if the labels glow in the dark...just saying 😉 and what would be even cooler is if this device could have a control volume that way I wouldn't have to do it on the receiver just saying again 😉 but overall I love this product. ♥️",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Hassle free and convenient,"I've been looking into wireless Bluetooth earbuds for a while now, but I definitely didn't want to spend a ton of money on the big name brands out there. I found these and I'm glad I made the decision to buy them! They come with 4 different ear bud sizes and the small fits my ears perfectly. The sound quality is great and there is some noise cancellation. It is possible to only use one and leave the other in the case, but make sure that you're using the right ear bud because it is the master ear bud that connects to your device. Overall, I find these extremely convenient to use and the charging case fits perfectly in my pockets when I'm on the go!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would give more stars if possible!,"These things are amazing!! I got these on the recommendation of a friend and fell in love immediately. The audio output and noise cancellation work great as advertised, perfect for going to the gym and everyday work.

The product is extremely adaptive and convenient:
- Comes with various heads in case the standard size is either too big or too small.
- Can go back in RECHARGABLE, capsule-like case when not in use.
- Water-resistant/sweat-resistant
- The buds are magnetically attached to the case and are easy to take out and put in - the case is also magnetically shut.
- Automatically pair with device after removing buds from portable charging case.
- Also, comes with a 1-year warranty redeemable on the manufacturer website - provided you also provide your Amazon order number (to prove that you bought it, duh).

I've been so impressed with this product so much that I ordered two more pairs, one for my brother and one for my aunt.

I've yet to use Galaxy Buds/ Air Pods but I can honestly say I would prefer these. Price was definitely a factor in my decision to get these and I'm glad I did, no evidence of sacrifice to product effectiveness to cut costs.

While I whole heartedly love this product and have recommended it to others, there *are* some things that I would ask to possibly improve on any future models of this brand: improve upon the device's inputs from the button on the sides. What I mean by this is that to play/stop music or accept/end/reject calls/call the last person you spoke with, you would click on either left or right ""bud"". My qualm with this is that it's a bit awkward considering you either ""press further into your to make use of the buttons"" or partially remove it from ear and then click on it and then put it back in your ear. Not any bit of a hindrance on the product's effectiveness or utility whatsoever, just a suggestion if further models are released with this brand. The only other thing I would like is to include how long the battery life on the charging case and the buds are actually for after full charge - not stated (to my knowledge) on the product info on Amazon nor the instructional pamphlet included in the box.

In conclusion, this product is fantastic! Will continue to spread the good word and recommend this product to friends and family.

"Incredibly high quality, top tier features for a fraction of the cost (IPX8 & 8mm Drivers)","I've only had these a few days, but I have to say I'm absolutely blown away. I've been getting sick of my traditional usb-c headphones as I'm an avid bodybuilder and the cable is often a problem; between needing to keep my phone nearby, catching it during runs/lifts, etc.

I spent a good amount of time comparing these to competitors, to higher end brands (ones in the $150+ range, etc.) and made the plunge with these. For $50 they offer basically the latest features that even name brands struggle to match.

Pros:

+ Build quality & appearance: I was incredibly impressed with this. The buds are extremely solid and while the charging case feels a 'bit' cheap, the buds drop in with ease thanks to magnet grips and the case offers simple and intuitive charging status for the case itself and the buds. 'Plugging' the buds in is satisfying and easy (the magnets are strong) and the case closes with magnet as well, very firm construction and there's no worry of the buds being disrupted in travel or falling out. The case claims it can charge the buds to full 4x before it needs to be charged itself, and it's a very convenient design to grab and go. Very happy with it.

+Comfort: I was a bit concerned with this as I tend to dislike a lot of 'in-ear' buds, however these fit extremely well; even during rigorous workouts, runs or even in the shower they don't move an inch. They are also just comfortable in general as I actually don't notice them over time as I have with other earbuds. They come with 3 extra sizes in addition to the ones that they come with. I actually seemed to be fine with the 'default' ones, but may try a size down as they 'can' sometimes get disturbed. Point being they'll fit any ear like a glove.

+Features: Here's where I was REALLY impressed, after scanning tons of brands & the reason I settled on them. (including MUCH pricer buds, these had some of the best specifications even compared to 'luxury' earbuds in the $150+ range)

++ IPX8 - I noticed this was rare even among much more expensive brands. These buds/case are completely waterproof up to 1+ meter. I sometimes wear them in the shower with my phone 10-15ft away without any static or sound issue. If you are a swimmer I'd imagine you would have zero issue with these. (for comparison the nearly $200 Jabra Elite Active 65t are only 1P65-- basically 'sweat resistant') There's something extremely cool about jumping in the shower after a workout or even listening to a podcast before work!

++ 8mm bass drivers & sound - again another stand out feature. The bass on these hit HARD, better than probably any earbuds I've owned. To put it in comparison again, the Jabra Elite Active 65t use 6mm drivers. The sound quality is also crystal clear, but I'm not an audiophile by any means, how they stand up to more expensive brands I don't know; but the lows and highs are pitch perfect to 'my ears,' and again did I mention the bass? They are also EXTREMELY loud, I can usually only handle about 70-80% depending on media (music is a bit louder than youtube, etc.)

++ Bluetooth 5.0 - while this feature is common now with wireless headphones, combined with the IPX8 you can comfortably wear these in the pool/shower with your phone 20ft+ away.

Cons:

I can't really speak to any so far. They boast better features than earbuds for a fraction of the cost, are extremely well built and not obnoxious looking like a lot of wireless earbuds. The pairing could maybe be slightly faster, but it's sort of a non issue. Setup was as easy as removing them from the case, pairing once and then you're done. They take maybe 10 seconds to 're-pair' if you power off or remove from case, but you can simply put them in your ear and you'll get a 'device paired message.' Just a tip - the right earbud is the 'primary,' you always need to turn that one on first if they are turned off otherwise they may have trouble pairing. (they have to 'pair to each other' than they pair to your device, the whole process only takes 5-10 seconds)

The true test will be how the old up after a few months in the gym/use, but for the price you really can't go wrong. If you are someone that wants to have total control over your earbuds with an app such as equalizer settings, talk functions, etc. these may not be for you. However for just a general earbud that is sturdy, sounds great, and can take calls, you can't beat them, even at a higher price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Fantastic Earbuds!,"These earbuds are awesome! I really like the way they activate and pair as soon as you take them out of the box. The indicator lights on the box show how many charges you have left really nicely. They fit flush in my ears and are very comfortable. Another nice feature is that you can use only the right earpiece without having to use the left, keeping one ear free to outside sounds.

Buy these! You won’t regret it!,"I got my TOZO’s only yesterday, but I love them already. I had raycons previously and they were TERRIBLE.

So much better than dealing with cords.,I bought these because I kept yanking my corded earphones out of my ears when reaching for books or moving my mouse around.

These are Fantastic Earbuds!!,I was surprised with the sound that comes from these earbuds. They have great bass and rich sound. They fit perfectly in my ears. ( I have smaller ear canals so I had to go with the smaller ear tips) I have had trouble finding earbuds in the past that fit. I love the wireless charging also. It makes it so much easier to charge without the hassle of connecting wires. The battery lasts quite long too.

Glad I bought these,"I was looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for work and travel.  I work outside so being sweat and water proof is a huge plus.  Theyre also good for my walks at the beach and perfect for using on flights.  I cant wear Ipod earbuds… they hurt my ears too much.

Great quality and great customer service!,"I love this product! I wouldn't 100% buy from them again. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The battery lasts a long time.

My stepson requested this product as a birthday gift. I liked what I read in reviews so much; I decided to buy one for myself. My stepson has worked perfectly, but
my left ear bud quit working. Of course it was after the warranty. This company trouble shot with me, and when they decided it couldn't be fixed, they sent me a new set of wireless earbuds. It was hassle free.

My only problem is that once I step out, the left side starts cutting in and out.  I contacted the manufacturer, who suggested I remove the from my device, reinstall and re-pair.  I did that and the same thing continues to happen to the left side. Hannah has emailed me and said they will be sending a new pair.

"Great Sound, Great Quality, But Poor Fit","Good,
The product has really crisp and nice bass. It’s pretty comfortable to wear since it is truly wireless earbud. The build quality is pretty nice too. The case has a solid weight and the earbud itself is very light. The material used in these are pretty solid.

Bad,
I don’t know if it’s just me but it really does not fit my ear well. Earbuds end up falling when I’m doing any activity which defeat the purpose of the earbud. I’ve switched out earbud tips but they don’t really do good job holding the earbud into your ears. It kind of hurts too if you wear this for a long time. I would definitely invest in better earbud tips.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Mixed feeling on this product.,"Pro
-Sound. For the earbud under $50 and compared with higher end earbuds, this is good enough for every day use. Well.. being really exact not every day use and it'll be explained in cons.
-Battery Life. I had no issue on batter life on both earbuds and case. They are exactly as advertised I had no problem on battery running out during my use. To tell you the truth, max I've used this for was about 2 hours and a half.
-Phone Calls. People I was talking to was able to hear background noise but they had no issue hearing me.
-Holds steady in my ears. Comes with 4 different sizes so it should fit you find unless you have ear canal as big as a cave.

Con
-Connection. At home, fine. At shower, fine(IPX7 is true). Out for a walk/run, fine. Working out at the gym, disaster. Left ear is losing connection every second on and off. It kind of drives me crazy as I was focused on lifting. It sounds just fine only with right earbud on but hello this is a pair of earbud, not one single piece. I wanted to find a solution so I've had my wife to use it on crowded area and she had same issue.
-Customer Support. I've advised them what issue I had. They asked me to reset the earbuds and I've done so and issue was still the same. I asked them what the next step is and they've gone silent until now. That being said, I decided to just return afterwards.

Bottom Line is 3 Stars overall rating.

1 Star on Material quality.
5 Star on Sound quality.
5 Star on Battery life.
What turned me off was the connection of the left earbud.

In case if anyone is wondering what functions this one have. Both right and left earbud have buttons that clicks and have same function. Power on/off, answer call, reject call, hang up, stop and play music. There is no rewind, fast forward, skip track, volume control. For the price point, I think it's fair.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent purchase!!,"For TWS earbuds, these guys are the ticket! Crystal clear listening for both calls and music! Decent battery life.

No-Brainer at this Price Point,"There is no shortage of earbuds available here on Amazon in this price range, but i'm not sure you'll find any better, with these features, or more supported by the seller/manufacturer.

Waterproof and still full-range acoustics? Wireless Charging Case? Comfortable fit, for all ears--Apple earbuds don't work for my ears? Slam dunk.

I'm sure there are other products in this range that will serve but it's a veritable morass and i'm here to tell you that these are most definitely worth your money. Add to that the moment i had an issue with pairing with one of my devices, the manufacturer was quick to respond and assist. What will be your fate with another of these manufacturers? Another plus is that you can see in the details of the packages in a solid manual in unbroken english, it's a well developed product and not merely a knock-off.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sound,My daughter wanted AirPods which she got because she’s a girl but my son didn’t want to spend that much money and so after a week of searching I wander onto these earbuds.  I was amazed at the sound quality of these which to me were as good if not better than the AirPods which cost 3X as much.  My wife was so impressed we ordered a pair for her.  The only thing is that we can’t register the two for warranty under the same email address.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great fit with quality sound,"The earbuds connected quickly and easily. Sound quality is good, much better than expected.

Not For Small Ears,"Received them, opened up the box, looks like I was expecting.  Then I tried them on, or attempted to.  Couldn't get them to fit right, not even close.  Tried all of the earpiece sizes, tried rotating them per the instructions (and instructional videos) to no avail.  I contacted TOZO, they responded within 12 hours, and sent a link to a video for making sure I was getting the proper fit.  I did what they indicated.  The problem being that my ears are too small to get the earbuds in deep enough to lock them in.  If you have small ears, be aware that these may not be right for you.

Amazon and Tozo customer service were responsive and helpful.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best of its kind so far,"I have tried numerous wireless earbuds and in the end they have all let me down. That is until I received these earbuds.

The first thing I noticed was the obvious improvement in quality of the charging case. The previous cheaper brands I bought were flimsy.

The sound quality is very good. I have small earholes so once I put in the smaller rubber tips, it fit perfectly and makes a great seal and the buds stay in very nicely.

I have not had to deal with customer service but they at least have a one year warranty.

Now for the best part. These are wireless charging compatible. I sit them on my Samsung dual charger and they immediately begin charging.

I know these are more expensive than some of the others in the same class but I could have bought several pairs of these with the money I threw away on cheaper brands.

Great product for the money,I got this on a dare to see what works better and this product by far worked just as good as some high dollar stuff.

Decent at first,"I originally bought these and was having discomfort issues causing my ears to swell up. They also did not stay in my ears well. Well I have to say was super impressed with customer service. They took the time to mail me a brand new pair for free! Well I was pretty satisfied, up until today. out of nowhere, my earbuds kept disconnecting and reconnecting. Then the womans voice my right earbud turned into a high pitched squeaky voice. i turned it off right away & attempted to turn it back on. Now it will not turn on at all and i tried charging it all morning through the afternoon. I've only had these for maybe a month and they're only ever in my ear or in the case inside my lunch bag for work. So theres no way for anything to have happened.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Ridiculous.....ly amazing,"I received my earbuds and thought ""well lets open this piece of crap and send it back."" Then I opened the package and saw the box. First of all, the packaging is quality. Secondly, the product itself is beautifully designed and very high quality. So I thought the sound quality would be the factor that got me to send it back; I was flabbergasted. Deep crisp bass and clean treble tones greeted my ears. So then I thought it would have to be the fit - I tested them whilst using the heavy bag, lifting weights, then on a four-mile run. The only time I felt I had to take them out was once during the run when I accidentally knocked the right bud out myself.
These things are nuts!! One of the best investments I've made. Right now I am on week two of having them and I love them. At the price, it is a whole lot of bang for the buck.

Cons:
I find that some people find it hard to hear me when I'm using the phone function in a noisy room or an area with a lot of ambient noise, but then again people can barely hear me anyway on the phone so whatever. All in all 5 stars from me - very satisfied customer.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Too much bass!,"This earbud set is fine if you're not too fussy about sound. They fit fine, charging/storage case is cool but like I said, I don't care for the sound. They sound cheap (like a low-fi mp3) and there's way too much bass.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Easy to use and sound great.,"Bought these to replace the neckband style I've been using for the past few years and was immediately impressed. They came fully charged and paired with my Note 8 almost instantly. They're comfortable and sound great. And the little carrying case that they come with is super cool because I use 1 bud at a time, so the one not in use stays constantly charged, so basically with me going back and forth on the individual buds, these things will last me about 2 days on a single charge.  I'm all in on these little buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound quality,"I am very impressed with the Tozo T10. There build quality is impressive and they possess an incredible amount of features for the price (wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's possess).

Pairing them with my phone was easy and the seller provides a simple for follow guide for those who may need additional assistance. The bluetooth v5.0 provides for a better connection as greater distances. The clarity and richness are of a quality that one would expect from a high end earbuds. I have not tested the water prof feature of the T10's although I am certain that they will live up to the expectations of the seller. I was pleased to find that I could use the T10's for a little over four hours before they required a charge and that I was able to get four charges from the case before the case batter required recharging.

Super easy set up and a charger on the go.,"So I got these and figured since it's two earbuds it might have an issue pairing both to my phone at the same time.

Now the moment you take them out its instant pairing, as far as sound quality and what not it's great especially at a noisey gym you still hear the music and only the music.

"Dang, these are good.","I bought these not expecting much because of the low price tag. I’ve bought many other headphones and earphones surpassing these in price. I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy good sound and with a bunch of headphones and earphones in the bag I’ve been exposed to many different cans.
These fit snug, I had trouble at work keeping in some other earbuds, they wouldn’t insulate well and was just a treble fest. These stay in and even if your ear gets sweaty they still stay in. The magnetic case is really handy, those earbuds will not fall out of the case and the hole for keychain access makes it that much better.
Sound quality is great, I was blown away by how punchy the bass is and how the highs are really drawn out. While I don’t believe they are balanced or flat, for people who listen to most genres these should do just fine. I do believe the highs and lows do drown out the mids a bit, but honestly it’s nothing a EQ couldn’t fix. The battery is standard for most earbuds on the market, but I’ve managed to squeeze out 7 hours on about 60% volume. The case also provides ~3 full charges for the earbuds.
For the price tag, I couldn’t recommend another wireless earbud brand, don’t be deterred by the name. These are the real deal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"High quality, worth the price","I've had these headphones for about a month and a half now and I'm very happy with them. After buying pair after pair of super cheap bluetooth headphones that would suddenly stop working or the battery life would drop off after just a few charges, I decided to spend a little bit more and I'm so glad I did.

I literally use these every single day- at work, at the gym, running outside, and just doing everyday stuff. I work in a lab where there's loud equipment and machinery operating pretty much all the time, but these headphones do a great job of blocking out ambient noise, while not blocking so well that I couldn't hear alarms or someone trying to get my attention.

They seem really durable- I've dropped them in a full sink and had them roll down my driveway in the rain and they were totally fine. The manual says you can even go swimming with them, but I'm not really willing to try that. Sometimes when I sweat a lot, it makes the earbuds start to slip out or shift around, which can distort the sound. That's my one single complaint with these earbuds but it honestly might be a problem with all similar types of headphones idk.

 I've found that the battery lasts me about 4 hours so I need to charge them halfway through the day, but they take like 10 minutes to go from 0 to 100% battery- maybe that's a standard charging time these days but I think that's amazing! I charge them on my lunch break and they usually last until the end of the day.

The charging dock is also really nice. It can be charged wirelessly or by USB cable and both ways work well. I think the dock's battery has about 2.5 full charges worth of power for the earbuds, but I've never totally run out the battery on the charger so it might be able to do more. I've also gotten multiple emails following up my purchase to offer me a free wireless charger, but I already have one and don't need another one.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They are ok but have issues.,"I've used quite a few different bluetooth headsets with both a PC and an android phone and none of them have been great. The biggest issue with these are the mic volume when you are talking to someone on the phone, sometimes the other person can hear me just fine other times they have to turn the volume all of the way up. This is not due to outside noise or some other noise, I've had this happen sitting at a quiet desk and walking outside, I've turned them off and on again and it fixes the issue. Also there is a long delay (30+ seconds) for them to connect to bluetooth on my phone, other bluetooth devices connect immediately these do not. Also not found a good way to keep them in place in my ear while jogging, they seem to bounce loss and then I have to push them back in again, I'm still trying to find the right size for me. Also have they seem to have a lot of issues with discounting from one ear to the other when just walking around and moving, I'll hear it drop and sound come from my phone (phone is in my pocket) and then come back on but on the left ear only then on both ears. This is really annoying when you are trying to listen to something and I have never experienced these with other devices.

Overall I would not recommend them, I think the cheap pair of Senso's I have work better and sound better. It was also really annoying that the company contacts buyers and offers them a free wireless charger if they provide a good review on here, this seems really unethical and it explains why there are so many good reviews on these.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Missing additional sized ear caps.,"They seem fine, but I did not receive any additional ear caps in my box... Just one size, and they're kinda snug. I think I have some other ear caps in a drawer somewhere. So, I'm not going to pitch a fit too much about it.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really great sound and noise cancelling,"I liked how the setup for these earbuds took almost no time and I can quickly switch between my macbook and iphone if I want to use it for either. The voiceover when it connects is nice because it tells you that you have a call and such. The earbuds came with 4 different sizes which was very useful since my ears couldn't fit the original size, swapping out to the large was necessary and it's a perfect fit! I like most how I don't have to play them loud at all, I keep them at the first 2 digits on the volume and this is because of how well it cancels other noise. Overall, I'm currently enjoying these earbuds and will continue using them for as long as possible! It's nice that they are waterproof and they are pretty durable. The case is also a nice shape, you can even hang it from a keychain or something using the lanyard, but it fits in my relatively large pockets well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality,"These are alot louder than previous headphones I've bought and I really like that it's good for canceling out noise around me i havent tested waterproofness but i dont plan to either, case seems good quality and snaps shut well",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
loved until...,"I have to admit i really love these earbuds. The sound is great, they pair easily and they fit perfect in my ear. unfortunately after about four months of sporadic use they  do not hold much of a charge anymore and my window for return just closed. other wise good purchase.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great value and solid product,"The size and weight of these is perfect for me.  They stay put and last through a workout at the gym without a wire to get caught on the equipment.  So far I'm thrilled with my purchase.  I was hesitant to pay such a price for a brand I've never heard of, but no regrets after trying them out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Have the ability to come loose in the ear.,Ultimately I was looking for a quality alternative to Apple Earbuds and this product stacked up well with the exception of a firm ear fit.  They often come loose during workouts (jogging or jumping rope).  I tried all the ear adapter sizes but none compared to how secure the Apple Earbuds I have tried before.  A little disappointing in this regard but for a 1/3 the price I'll deal with the inconvenience . . . for now,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome value for the money,"I cannot believe the sound out of these, and they stayed in my ears during a wet, 4 mile run.  Sound quality is better than my Bose Sound Sport, which have the connecting wire on the back of the neck (which tends to grab a wet neck and pull out of your ear when you turn your head).  The Bose also fall out on occasion.  These were so great I turned around and bought my wife a pair!

If there is a downside, the buttons only control the phone, so I can't skip or start/stop music.  Also, initially the bass seemed a bit heavy, though I stopped noticing after a while.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
good product for the money,The headphones took me a little while to get to work. The first time I tried pairing them with my IPhone I could only hear out of one headphone. I placed them on the charger for a little while and took them to the gym and they paired perfectly. I think they just needed to be charged a little longer. They arrived in brand new packaging on the estimated day of delivery. Setting up the warranty was super easy and I received an email from the company within a couple days of registering my product to thank me for my purchase and offering a wireless charging station. The color I wanted wasn't in stock so I ordered the white ones to get them sooner. I'm very happy with my purchase!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for the gym,"I bought these to replace some expensive Jay birds I had.  I got tired of the wire connecting both ears.  These are great because they are separate, they have a tad too much bass, but it isn't terrible.  You can adjust your EQ and it'll be perfect, I just don't like the inconvenience of having to change it back for when my car connects.

I've used these maybe 10 times, get very sweaty, and they're working fine.  The rechargeable battery dock is a nice touch.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No need to buy any other earbuds!!,"I recieved jabra elite earbuds for Christmas which cost over $170.00 for the pair. Fortunately I lost them which made me purchase the tozo t10 and I have to say the tozo are much better. Better sound by far, easier to keep in your ears and better distance. You wont be disappointed with these.. dont waste your money on overpriced earbuds it's not necessary these cover everything you need.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value! Buying another set for my wife.,Great Value. Got on Amazon to just find some quality ear plugs for swimming.  Stumbled across these and for the negligible price difference decided to go with these. They fit great I am a big guy but have small ear canals so having the different adapters was really nice. I had to use the smallest. They are comfortable and have no problem staying in when working out or even swimming.  While they are water resistant they are not 100% water proof in that you can't just drop them in the pool or wash them under running water. As long as they are in your ear they are waterproof providing they have a good seal in your ears and your not diving beyond 3 feet. Sound is good. I'm no HIFI expert but the sound is good with high highs and good bass response as well. Range is great. Note when swimming that when you go under the water the sound will break up or cut out all together due to the signal being blocked by the water. This is not the fault of the earbuds themselves.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound While They Last,"I have had the earbuds for roughly 3 months and they were great for working out, work around the house, and listening to videos. However, there were three really big downsides: Bluetooth quality, lifespan, false garuntee. I first noticed the Bluetooth connection to my phone was spotty whenever I would go out for a run. It seemed that the connection would not hold while on the move and my left earbud would stop playing audio at random points as I ran. Walking, however, did not affect the connection. Not being able to use these on a run was a large upset. Second, after the three months of use, my right earbud died. Not in the sense that the battery ran out, but that it would play sound at an almost inaudible level. Now, the right earbud has ceased playing any audio at all, yet I can still connect it to the left bud and connect it to my phone. So, I decided to cash in on the free ""1-Year extended warranty"" that comes in the package with the product. Just filling out the information for the warranty was tedious and suspicious as it was not specific at all towards who bought what product, and thus, I have been denied any for of re-imbursement or replacement. The T10s were great for those three months, but I would not recommend if you are not looking to repetitively buy earbuds every three months!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Pleased with the quality of the product and service!!,First I have tried several different relatively BT earbuds and been very disappointed with durability and battery performance. From the first use the quality in these earbuds was apparent just by how they feel and operate. Battery life has been great. I have been able to listen for hours at a time without having to recharge. The bluetooth syncing has also been a breeze and the sound quality is great considering the price range. All in all I've been satisfied with my purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
ANYTHING can cause interference.,"I bought these so that I could listen to my music while I went on my daily runs. They look cool, they feel comfortable, and they seem like they'd be great. But they're not. I have yoga pants with pockets, and if I put my phone in my pocket, my music cuts in and out. If I put  it in my backpack, the connection is lost entirely. The only way I can keep the connection somewhat stable is to put my phone in my bra--which I was trying to avoid with yoga pants with pockets in the first place. And even then, if I turn my head too far to one side, the connection is lost.

If you plan on putting your connected device in your pocket, don't buy these earbuds. Heck, if you plan on doing anything that isn't holding your device right in front of your face with absolutely no barriers, then don't buy these.

Everything else about these is great. But they're just not effective for doing anything at all. I'm extremely disappointed.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for Running,"I've used a Jaybird headset in the past for workouts, couldn't get them to last 1 year without failure.  So I decided to try these due to the price point and customer reviews.  Took a couple of the ear piece trials to find the best fit and function.  I have them for about 2 weeks and I'm pleased with the performance and great sound.  I would only suggest some additional ear pieces in foam, I've found they are the best in comfort and sound.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product Great price,"Was looking for wireless headphones to try out since I was looking to ditch the cable. I commute by motorcycle most of the week, so I was hoping they would work inside the helmet. To my surprise they work perfectly with a slight change to how I put on the helmet. But overall I can’t hear the deafening  decibels, I’ve used them in the shower successfully. Looking forward to seeing what more these can last through.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
T10 Tozo Earbuds Review - So far so good!,"I have only used them a handful of times, but the sound quality is really nice. Comfortable, doesn't hurt my ears. Volume can be loud enough, never find myself turn up the volume to max to listen to them.  As far as noise canceling I find myself adjusting them in my ear trying to sometimes get them to sit just right to cancel out more noise. But overall very happy with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great fitting earbuds!,"I was a but skeptical about getting some wireless earbuds that only go inside you ear as I was worried they would fall off during workouts, but I am glad I went with these. I've been using them daily for the past couple of days with no issues at all. They stay in snug and sounds quality is amazing. Would highly recommend to everyone!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product Believe the Hype....,"I use these when i am mowing. They have good volume and are very clear. I am having some connection issues but i believe that are phone related....  I was hesitant at first but am glad i was able buy a pair....

Just an FYI always remove the right ear bud first get it in your ear then removes the second. This patter seems to have helped with the connection items......

Great product.....",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
ground sound & connection for an amazing price,"After my others (brain fart, can't remember the brand, but waterproof, $250ish from Best Buy, not Bose) died I needed something to replace them because....let's be honest, working out at the gym without headphones sucks. Was skeptical cause these showed up as amazon's ""top seller"" or whatever, and usually those are paid reviews. But these have way better sound than I thought, they don't stick out of my ears like I see some of the other brands (JBL / Bose). Huge fan of these. HUGE",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exceeded expectations for the price,"For about $50, these earbuds surprised me. The fit is snug and comfortable. The sound quality is excellent. The case wireless charging is a very nice added bonus.

Crackling Sound on two different pairs,"I bought these from a recommendation from a friend.  Production quality must have changed because the first pair I received, after pairing, had a crackling sound in each ear piece.  I tried pairing to another device and got the same thing.  I reset them, removed the old paring record from my phone and tried again, same result.  I chalked it up to a faulty pair and put in a return and had them ship me out another pair.  Got them, same exact issue, in that state they are unbearable to listen through.  Disappointed for sure.  Returned both pairs.  I don't recommend them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"As an Audiophile, I'm blown away!","Fifty dollars (plus shipping) well spent. The stereo-feel to these are incredible. I usually only wear one ear-bud, so I underestimated the full experience of the T10's.

I can't seem to get them to sit right in my ears when I have my motorcycle helmet on, but that was expected.

The noise cancellation isn't overpowering, but feels natural.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Stay properly in place and are water resistant!!!,"Bought Tozo T10 after reviewing multiple brands. I am very satisfied and happy with my purchase. They stay in place in the ear while I am exercising canceling out most of outside noises. Also, I have already used them in the pool and taking showers and still functioning exactly the same. Design is good and pair mode process is simple. Only one opportunity of improvement would be the Bluetooth range is not long enough compared to other brands, so I have to keep the phone within 11ft in a straight line from it. No walls and turns because it will start dropping reception.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
product is great but does have an issue,"I loved the sound better than any wired set of earbuds.  The noise cancelation is great, riding my motorcycle now sounds like the interior of a car.  Putting the helmet on requires a bit of flexing of the helmet to get it over the earbuds.  Some have posted about the buds especially the left bud cutting in and out.  I have had this happen too and it seems to be a transmission/reception issue.  In my home the buds do not cut out but if I walk outside, place the top of my phone on my left hip, the sound fully cuts off. My home has layers of brick and metal, radio signal bounce off it so I have to use an external antenna. The Bluetooth signal is trapped in the house so I get great coverage indoors.  Outdoors it is a different story, body parts can block the signal, holding the phone flat and facing you gives a perfect signal.  This issue becomes a feature if you're like me and forget to take your phone with you.  At home, no interruptions, at the gym, I start to walk off, turn away and it cuts out for a second I turn back, pick up my phone and water bottle and NEVER forget my phone!
I am impressed with the engineering on the TOZO T10, it works great in the shower, phone use is clear and crisp, well worth the price!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
First Use of Wireless Ear Buds,"I don't have an opportunity to use earbuds often but felt that lack of wires would be nice on those occasions when I do.
While I have not used the Tozo during activity they fit snuggly in my ears and cancel outside noise very well.  They connected easily to my Ipad and my Apple TV.  The sound quality is great and I no longer have to strain to hear whispered conversation on TV.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Amazing Sound Quality & Easy to Pair,"I love love love these earbuds. I looked long and hard and read more reviews about earbuds than I care to admit. I was finally sold when I read a review of these that were right up my technical-alley. I'm a sound snob, unfortunately and these produce all that I could hope for short of being in a concert standing next to the speakers! I have two pair so while one charges I can listen to the other. They both pair without any problems to my Samsung Galaxy S7 and are easy to wear. They never hurt my ears. I'm only sad I can't wear them more often (working meetings really get in the way of my musical enjoyment of these earbuds! :-)  ). I would venture to say that these are even better audio quality than the Bose earbuds I bought a couple of years ago, especially given the price! Go TOZO!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product and Customer Service!!,These earbuds are amazing. They provide a wonderful sound experience. The earbuds come with 4 different size ear caps for optimal comfort.

Bestest Bluetooth Earbuds,"After trying many many different Bluetooth earbuds I have found the best. I love how not only are they Waterproof but the charging case is too(IPX8). The sound is fantastic, better than any wired earbuds I have tried. You also get four different sizes for the rubber tips that hold them in your ears. Pairing with my phone couldn't be simpler. Once paired every time you remove them from the charging case they are paired up by the time you get them in your ears. These replaced a different brand that I received for Christmas. The other pair would turn on and pair to your device soon as they were fully charged. Stupidest thing I ever heard of. Who would want their earbuds to pair to your device while in a case. Not only wasted battery life but also messed with my phone. I would get a call and I could not hear anything and either could the person that called me. They were POPCHOSE so you know what not to purchase. I love my T10 earbuds and highly recommend them to friends, family and everyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great earbuds, fantastic sound, and case recharges earbuds!","I have been using these earbuds for about two weeks now. They are great! Each earbud last over 3 hours.

So far, they have been great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing earbuds!!,"Great product. Theyre very comfortable and well made. Strong magnets to secure headphones in case but also the lid to the main body of the case(when closed).Sound quality and bass is pretty good.overall id give this product a 5/5 expecially with consideration of the price you cant beat it.

"Alright, but not the best","This product works OK. I'm still using it after several months, but it's not my primary wireless device. The battery last a few hours between recharging. The headphones don't work great when I'm bending down to do yard work. Somehow my body is blocking coordination when that happens. I would price these at closer to $30 than the $50 I paid.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"So far, SO good.","I must start this out by saying that I am not an intensive user of earbuds/headphones. I don't typically wear and use them for hours on end, and I have almost never burned through a single charge on wireless headsets. I use them walking from my car to my office building and back. I don't use earbuds for phone calls and can't really speak to how well they work for that. What I can say is that, after using the Plantronics BackBeat GO 2 earbuds for a bit over two years, I was growing tired of the cord catching on my jacket collar and them pulling out of my ears every time I turned my head. I wanted to try some true wireless earbuds, but I wasn't going to pay a whole lot for them. I got the Tozo T10 because of decent reviews and a good price. I had read the 1- and 2-star reviews and understood the issues. I am also aware that bluetooth can be far from perfection. I was (and am) prepared for these not to work very well. I've been using them for the better part of a week and have to say I've been pleasantly surprised at how much I like them.

Fit - this was a prime concern as I was initially worried about them flying out of my ears while just walking down the street. With 4 sizes of cushions, I experimented and settled on a size that works for me. They hang in there just fine and maintain a seal that usually provides good sound (occasionally my left channel gets wonky if it moves a bit, but I've had that trouble before and think it's my ear and not the earbud).

Sound - sound is great. I typically just listen to podcasts, so sound quality isn't high on my list of requirements, but I did happen to put some music through them and it sounded good to me. I am not an audiophile or anything and don't get too worked up about sound quality, but I can say that for me, the sound is pretty damn good.

Connection - jury's out on this and I'm still collecting evidence. So far it hasn't been bad. I did find when I connected to my Samsung tablet (to watch a movie at work) the earbuds got a bad connection due to conflict with a bluetooth keyboard also connected at the same time. But again that's typical of the bluetooth technology and not really a knock against the earbuds. I'm still concerned how it progresses. Many of the lower-starred reviews mentioned that connectivity issues appeared after a short time, so like I say, I'm keeping my ears open for any problems. Right now... they're working fine.

Battery - as stated previously I really have no idea if these have the battery life advertised because I never wear them long enough to go through a single charge. I like that they recharge in the case and that it functions as a portable charger. It seems to hold a fair amount of charge. I suspect if you are a light user of headsets you'll be pleased with these.

Waterproofing - I've used them in the shower once so far without issue. I haven't tried swimming with them and honestly probably won't. I can see using them in the shower more often though.

Travel - I will say that due to the case being a charger it is necessarily a bit bulky. There will be no slipping this into your pants/jeans pockets and going about your day. But since the buds themselves are small and easy to misplace without it, keeping the case nearby is kind of important. It comes with a lanyard cord but I found that pretty useless. You can keep it in jacket pockets or a laptop bag/backpack. Pants pockets are going to get uncomfortable unless you're sporting cargo pants, and then you have to deal with the fact that you're wearing cargo pants.

Warranty - the earbuds come with a 1-year limited warranty from Tozo. Seems like a good thing. We'll see if I ever have to use it.

Summation - so far, so good. I expect if something adverse happens, I'll come back and update my review, but for right now I really do like the Tozo T10.

Full disclosure... Tozo offered me a wireless charger for free. They asked for, but did not require, a review. They put no conditions for getting the charger, only to confirm the address that the earbuds were shipped to. They seem like a pretty good, customer-focused, company.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty Good for the Money,"The feel of the earbuds are comfortable in any position. The sound quality is good, although they can't be super loud or they will rumble a lot and the sound distorts. It also beeps for a really long time after connecting the right earbud to your phone if you don't connect the left earbud (or if you connect it and disconnect it). Battery lasts if you charge intermittently with your dock. The best feature is the noise cancellation. Just putting them in cancels out a majority .All in all a good set of earbuds for 50$.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great buy!,"As others have said, the sound and feel of the earbuds are amazing, as I didn’t know what to expect with complete wireless earbuds.  The sound every bit as good as my wired Sony’s!  One thing that nobody else mentioned is the charging case they come with... it is a heavy duty design and well thought out.  This is important to me because they’ll be living in my book bag and get bounced around a lot.  The hinge and cover seem designed to withstand a fair amount of abuse compared to pictures I’ve seen of others.

The only negative that I’ve noticed is a slightly slow pairing when taking them out of the case, but that is most likely because of my very old iPhone 6.  Even so, I’m up and running in about a minute.

Overall, this was a great purchase and I’m extremely happy with them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They work great...until they stopped,"So I’ve recommended these headphones to a bunch of friends because normally they are great. They connect and disconnect automatically and sound and work great! Really do like these headphones. That being said, randomly recently the right headphone (the main one) has been randomly disconnecting from the left one on and off! It is incredibly annoying and making me reconsider these. I really do like these so if anyone has a fix for it I will take it! For right now I may have to get different headphones.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for the price,"4.5 Stars:
I'm a big fan of these headphones, in fact I'm actively using them right now.  I bought them mainly for noise suppression due to a noisy roommate (they are the saving grace of my sanity), but ended loving them all around as a solid set of bluetooth headphones.

Pros:
- Can wear to sleep (if you position pillows correctly, I sleep with a few) and work better than my earplugs (calming sleep music or falling asleep to audiobooks as an added bonus) - my alarm plays through the headphones, if they happen to still be charged when I wake up (good for naps)
- Can wear anywhere and have a decent normal range as bluetooth headphones go - I wear to the gym, grocery shopping, around the apartment, you name it.
- Can we worn in the shower and still work afterwards.  They don't always stay in the whole time, but I keep a towel nearby to dry off (both earbuds and ears) and reinsert.

Pro and Con:
The pro being they last a few hours on a single charge.  The con, the only work a few hours on a single charge.  The last set of bluetooth headphones I had (Jam mini buds) lasted a good 10-12 hours, so the trade off is real, but nothing I can't adjust to.  The travel charger is a life saver here.

Con:
- I wouldn't recommend if you're buying to swim with.  While they are water proof, as mentioned previously, I tried using them to listen to music when swimming laps and 1) as soon as I went under water, the music was cut off and 2) as soon as I pushed off the wall, they immediately fell out of my ears.

So overall, solid set of headphones for the gym, shower, and for everyday (and night for those of you who need it), but wouldn't buy for swimming.  Also received good customer service from Tozo itself following my order.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better sound and quality than $100 and up buds!,"I almost purchased the Samsung buds but after seeing the not so good reviews on them I continued searching and found the Tozo t10 buds and I'm so glad I did. These sound amazing, the base is deep and mids and highs are outstanding. I easily get through 3 hours of videos and music with these. Quality is great at this price point there's nothing to complain about. I recommend these and would buy again!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of headphones,"I keep searching for Bluetooth ear buds that work for me.  I look for battery life, simple designs, ease of use, performance and durability.

I unboxed the set, plugged the charger into my AC adapter.  The charging cradle has a battery life indicator.  Once the user removes the earbuds from the cradle, they appear on the iPhone Bluetooth options immediately.  They connect seamless to my phone.

Each earbud has a button to power it on and off, independently.  There are multiple inserts for different user sizes.  The system includes a charging cable for those without wireless charging, and there is a carrying strap which I find to be useless.

Sound quality of talk radio on Sirius/XM Radio and music are excellent.  There is a nice balance of midrange, treble and bass.  The standard sized ear pieces worked perfectly for me, and they're stable in the ears.

I may have to do a back up set since I really like these over other headsets/earbuds I have used in the past.

Definitely a two thumbs up for me.

Update:

Speaking indoors is not an issue. Sound and clarity is good on both ends. Outdoors, wind causes too much interference disrupting sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
There is a problem with the headset,"This headset has a very powerful bass that rivals AirPods and is stronger than Jabra. The phone call was also very clear.

Best Wireless Ear Buds Ever!,"These TOZO T10 BT 5.0 earbuds are the best I've ever had.  Most importantly, they stay in your ears.  All you do is twist after placing in your ear.  The sound is great.  Pairing is always a hassle with other earbuds, but these are a piece of cake.  The wired charger is great.  Place the buds in their two places in the charger (they fit) and lower the lid.  All done.  The BT reception range is not a long distance, but when you come back in range the music is still playing.  I can't ask for more.  The documentation is easy to read and I had these buds up in running in minutes.  No wonder these buds are ranked right after Apple's AirPods and before everything else on Amazon.

Great alternative to the $200 name brands,"I couldn't justify spending almost $200 on some Sony or Jabra true wireless earbuds, but I didn't want to waste money on some cheap $20 ones with horrible quality. These sound as good as my Ludacris SOUL earbuds and charge quick enough to let them sit when I'm away from my desk for meetings. I did have some static in the left earbud, but I determined it was from a crappy bluetooth transmitter in my laptop, not the earbuds themselves. I highly recommend these for someone who wants to get rid of wired earbuds but doesn't want to spend the money on a major brand.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best True Wireless Earbuds I've come across so far,"I've tried over 10 pairs of wireless earbuds and to be honest, these are the only ones worth keeping. First of all, I am so impressed by the sound quality, the deep bass, and the punchiness these earphones have.

A lot of other wireless earbuds don't offer much bass and their volume normally is weak due to the small size of the audio driver. But Tozo T10 comes with an 8mm driver and you could definitely feel the difference!

They are comfortable enough. Not the most comfortable ones I've tried but I have no issue with these earbuds in this aspect.

I'm impressed with the IPX8 certification and wireless charging. You get a lot of bang for your bucks definitely.

I hope these will last. I've only had them for a few days now.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easy to use and great quality!,"Have had these for a couple weeks - they are really good so far. Great battery life, actually fits in my ears (and my wife's too as we got her a pair), and excellent sound quality. Crazy easy to setup as well!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buy for price,"The earbuds fit well in my ear and I can leave my phone on the counter and go outside on the patio and still have connection. The pairing is slow so it is faster for me to go into setting ms and pick the earphones vs waiting for it to pair. And, when the phone rings it doesn’t always automatically go to earbuds/Bluetooth. Battery life is about 3.5 hours straight through. Otherwise I am very happy with these for 49 bux!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
GREAT SOUND QUALITY FOR THE PRICE,"I own an over the ear, noise cancelling head phones that I originally bought for when I exercise but they are bulky and trap sweat so I decided to look for something smaller.  I bought a couple of Apple AirPods for my boys the same day I ordered the TOZO T10 but didn't want to spend the same $$$ on myself.  I saw the great review for the TOZO T10 and started reading the reviews and decided to order a pair.  I placed the order on a Saturday and it arrived the next day which was a plus for me since I am typically impatient when it comes to wanting to get the product ASAP.  I was pleasantly surprised when I first used the earbuds.  They fit comfortably in my ears and the sound quality is crisp and are very comparable to the sound quality of the AirPods but at one-third of the price.  Very happy with the purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for the price!,These earbuds are pretty dope. I use them while I work and so far they function optimally. The case is sleek as well and I'm very fond of the magnetic charging dock. Worked perfectly straight out of the box and delivery took less than a day.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolute Garbage,"I’m writing this review for the third time. Initially, I purchased these earbuds based on the good Amazon reviews that I read. The pair I received had terrible sound quality and intermittent connectivity issues. TOZO read my first negative review and offered to replace them free of charge. They promptly sent me a new set of earbuds that were worse than the original. I applaud their excellent customer service, it is truly top notch. However, the product is absolutely terrible. There is no amount of customer service that will ever make up for the poor quality of this product. I literally just threw both sets of the earbuds (the set I purchased and the set they sent to me as replacement for free) in my kitchen trash can. That’s how bad they are. They sound terrible and they don’t connect easily if at all. I briefly considered giving them away to a person I disliked, but I was unable to think of anybody I disliked enough to do that to. They’re garbage, don’t waste your time or money on them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
AMAZING headphones!!,"Love love love these headphones! BEST bang for your buck! I am a huge geek when it comes to headphones and when I say they are great headphones (clear sounds and amazing bass), I don’t mean they are great only for their price range but they are simply amazing hands down. They don’t fall out even when I am exercising vigorously and yet super comfortable! Get them already :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Can't get any better, buy them!",Put them in and I couldn't even feel them! They connect smoothly and almost immediately. Very soundproof and have at least a 20-30 ft range. They fit nice in my purse and they are charged with a standard micro USB cord. I got the gold color and it blends in very discreetly in my ear. I'm so glad I bought these instead of dropping $150 on airpods. I have a OnePlus 6 and I couldn't love them more! GET THESE!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
HORRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY,Sound quality is patchy and the esthetic needs major Improvement but most importantly the buds will not stay in my ears. Maybe I’m a bit biased because I own a pair of Apple AirPods. I bought this item because I thought this can be a back up for wireless speakers but I can’t keep these things in my ears for more than two minutes and the sound quality is atrocious when compared to Apple. I’ll be returning to get my money back!!,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Sound quality not up to par,"My previous pair of bluetooth earbuds cost about $25 and had better sound quality and less latency.  These are very bassy, so much that the mids and highs are lost in the mix. On top of that, the highs sound compressed (like radio fuzz) which I've never heard before on any headphone. Another problem is latency which makes watching videos annoying since the audio is behind the video just enough to take you out of the experience.  Because of these faults, I decided to return these. Some final comments, these fit nice and the build quality seems fine, I did not get to test the battery life so no comment on that.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BASS LEVEL OVER 9000%,"Oh yeah, these earbuds are bomb. These babies are noise cancelling 9000%, with that nice deep bass that makes my spine shiver! They connected immediately and so far I've had no hassle using them at all. Showed my goth gf and now she is going to get them too, because I was right about these headphones actually being worth it. I would say these are worth it, and a safe buy for those that are skeptical.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
An amazing product at an amazing price!,"I thought these we're in amazing purchase for the price that they are! They have a long battery life! I can wear them in the shower without having to worry about them breaking! When the battery finally does go low it does not take too long to get a full charge again! I would recommend buying these if you're like me and have never bought wireless headphones before, I saw all the good reviews and I'm grateful that I looked at all the reviews before purchasing because that always helps me to purchase something is the reviews! Like I said I definitely recommend purchasing these I got them in Black. I believe they have five colors to choose from in all. And they do not feel heavy in my ears and they fit well! I think the only thing I do not like is that it's kind of hard to press the button to answer phone calls at Etc.. But other than that I find these to be very good and I've had no problems with them! My husband actually wants a pair now he he!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Very easy to use, fast pairing","I have had these headphones for a couple of days now and so far so good! The sound is great, and they pair to my phone as soon as I take them out of their case. My old headphones were also wireless but they has a little grip thing that went around the back of my ear, going from the extra ear support to none feels weird! I've worn them a couple times and they seem to stay in, I'm hoping with time I will adjust to how these fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works as described,"Great alternative to the much pricier ear buds.  They worked as described and came with 4 pairs of other ear pieces in case the default ones are too large.  Sound is great, and the unit can charge wirelessly.  It does take longer to pair again vs. other bluetooth headphones I have (about 10 seconds from taking them out of the case), but other than that, smooth sailing with these so far.  Also, these do not charge with my Samsung wireless charger that came with my Galaxy S10+, only with generic wireless chargers.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good bang for your buck.,"The T10's are a pretty solid set of Independant ear buds with a good design for the charging case and a lot of quality the price. They fit in my ear nice and snug and do a great job of tuning the world out with sound quality that carries a surprising about of bass from the size.

My only complaint is the battery time. I use these at my work and the 3.5 to 4 hour play time isn't ideal for an right hour shift. The buds charge in about a half hour to forty five minutes so I can charge them during my lunch break but being able to have a bit longer of a run time would be perfect for an office environment. Outside of that, sometimes there is a little issue in getting the ear buds to pair to themselves which is easily cleared by putting them back in the dock and retrieving them.

I'm happy I picked these up.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No volume or next song control. Not worth the price.,"It's very disappointing that you're unable to control the volume or playback with these ear buds. With these simple features lacking, these really shouldn't be more than $20.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds compared to Bose.,"First, I lost a pair of Bose earbuds that are similar. I did not want to spend a lot on another set and these filled the bill. They were shipped fast by Amazon. They were ready to use out of the package. Took about 4 seconds to connect to my iPhone, and sounded incredible. Much better than the Bose. I asked about leaving the case on a charger for one to two weeks and was quickly told do not do this. So response to questions is very fast and thorough. I would buy another pair. They have a really good support team. Answers are swiftly returned and they go out of their way to make you happy.  I am happy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cuts in and out,"I like the way they fit and look.  However, the audio cuts in and out every 20-30 seconds.  Very annoying when trying to work out.  Actually had to remove them to finish work out.  I have had other wireless earbuds that did not cut out at all.  Extremely disappointed in product.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
First pair had issues. Seller is sending a second pair.,"Update: I registered my warranty and reached out to TOZO via email. They were very responsive and wrote back within 1 day of filing warranty claim with offer to send brand new pair. Warranty claim process was very easy and all done through their website (no annoying 800 numbers). I was happy with the performance of earbuds previously sent, for the first week when they worked, they had great sound quality, fit and feel. Hoping second time is a charm.

Extremely disappointed. It seemed  like good quality out of the box, have chargeable case, good quality earphone set. Connected bluetooth when it arrived, seemed to work great, good sound quality, great fit in my ear, would have been great for workout. BUT, the Right earphone stopped working within one week of purchase. No heavy use, haven't even taken them to the gym yet. Expected better for the price.

Believe the negative ratings becasue it seems like the positive ratings are mostly fake.,"These constantly lose connection and are painfully irritating to use. Overpriced garbage at best!

Overall very satisfied,"I only just received my earbuds but so far I am very satisfied with them. The sound quality is better then I expected. The wireless charging is very handy since I already had a wireless charger. The different size rubber pieces allowed me to find a good fit for me. I even took them running and didn't have an issue with them falling out (even if I was careful to check them a lot so they did not). The magnets on the carrying case make it very secure. The case could be considered to be a little big to some but it is still small enough to slip in your pocket and forget it's in there.
I did have an issue where they were cutting out somewhat frequently but I found directions on how to reset the devices and have not had a problem since. It was probably just a glitch during initial setup.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Updated review - nice.,I originally wrote a negative review because my charging case would not work. The seller reached out to me and told me a new one was on the way. I had origally given this product a 3 but raised it to 5 stars because the seller reacted very fast and was proactive. The case works great and the earbuds are exactly what I was looking for.

"Great at first, but pairing issues","I've only had these for an hour, but I am already in love! They paired easy, they sound great, and they weren't $150 plus like other brands.

Pretty good overall!,"These fit well and sound fantastic.  Charging is quick and the case fits well in my pocket.  I like how fast they activate and synch when I take them out of the case.

Bang for your buck!,"I can’t begin to tell you how much better these wireless earbuds are compared to the AirPods. For one, they fit so snug in your ear and immediately cancels out noise. I can now enjoy my experience without any interruptions!
Every morning on my commute to work I’m using the wireless earbuds and also coming home. I’ve never had to fully charge it anytime during the week - that’s how good the battery life is!
I listen to a lot of podcasts so being able to hear clearly what I’m listening to is major. And with these wireless earbuds I don’t have to turn up the volume to the max or ever have to pause to replay.
You can’t beat the price on this product. It’s a win, win!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Definitely worth the price for what you get,"Very good sound and range was able to leave phone on other side of house and could still hear clearly with no issues. It will work with only one on but it has to be the right one and it will make a beeping noise until the left one is connected. They are waterproof I did take a shower however if they fall out whole wet they are hard to get them to stay back in while wet. The case does charge through micro USB which they include the cable but it is short. Full disclosure the company does contact you to leave a review in exchange for sending you something for free like a battery bank in my case, they don't say it has to be a positive review but just leave a review.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My listening experience has been 1000% improved.,"I thought of buying airpods before I found these and I'm so thankful I didn't, these are so much better, they have a great feel to my ear and the best bass I've heard in earbuds in a while, the wireless charging makes it so that I can just leave them at the base and not have to think about if they're charged when I'm heading out, the battery life is also great, they haven't died once in any of my calls or listening sessions, most definitely a cop for anyone looking for wireless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Totally disappointed,The sound on these suck. The sound also goes in and out where I can only hear through one of them and then it will cut back in through both. They also don't automatically connect to one another. It usually takes several attempts to get them to connect to what ever device I am using. The wireless charging worked at first but now they will only charge if plugged in. Waste of money. That is what I get for going cheap.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Definitely worth the price. A+ quality for the price!,"I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones, as the nature of my work requires me to wear a headset all day, and the over-the ear variety causes a headache so bad that when I'm not working, I don't want to put another pair on. (It's also my preference, so wanted to try something new.)

Straight out of the box, I was able to pair it easily with my phone, my computer was a bit harder, but that was just due to outdated bluetooth drivers, and I managed to solve that issue.While the quality for sound is not perfect, it's great for the price, and I personally love to hear the bass in everything, so I was already happy they seem to bring out the bass in things well.

To me they look a little awkward, but of course, any bluetooth headphones look at least a little silly, it comes with the territory.

Battery life. These things say they have 5 hour talk time, and I would not be surprised. I used them all day yesterday, granted no longer than a few spurts at a time, but I can tell these will last.

Overall very satisfied, and for a good budget  bluetooth earbuds, I would highly recommend. Quality isn't great in the sound department, but it's good for the price point, and I feel anyone who wants to worry about that knows that most of the time, you're looking at higher price points for the quality you're looking for.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality and good bang for the buck!,"Can't beat the quality for the price! Would definitely recommend
Low-end (bass) and high-end (voices) are both very responsive and connectivity works consistently (sometimes takes time connect, but eventually gets there).
Bought them for working out and is a game changing upgrade from my old wired headphones.
The 200hz range is a bit high though, so the sound quality is a little on the muddy side.

Customer service is top-notch. Bought two of these but had issues with one of them, customer service was quick to send us a replacement.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very satisfied music lover! Very satisfied!!!,"Bought a pair for my wife as a gift, of course I had to try them out. I was highly impressed, crisp clear sound, the right of bass, can actually feel it from the earbuds. Quality build and perfect charging system.

High quality earbuds,The earbuds were delivered today with great anticipation and I was not let down!

Perfect,"These are so sweet! Dynamic sound, loud, and simple operation. I ride gnarly bike trails and these don't budge . They look good and simple, unlike the flamboyant apple earpods",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound but Left ear bud cuts connection constantly,I have to say for the price they are great. The sound quality and bass are amazing. The down fall tho is the quality control on these as my left earbud cuts out and some times just doesnt connect at all the right stays playing. and to be clear this has been straight out of the box not days later.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Don't bother.  There are so many similar ones, I recommend trying a different one than these.","These are not usable headphones, it will cut out on the left ear if you press your phone into your left hip.  I suspect the Bluetooth reception may have trouble reaching the 'master' right side earphone through the human body.  I also see it cutting when I've held the phone with my right hand (to stay on side of the master receiver), and turned my head left or right, similarly cutting out reception when my phone orbits my head.  Not sure why, but imo definitely should happen and not even a possible limitation to Bluetooth itself.  Bass also sucks, out of the box, the treble is predominant (tinny).

On a live test run, I hiked about 90 minutes over 4.5 miles.  Rather than focus on positives (all things which should ""normally be expected), here are the additional negatives that convince me to return the product:

-Preparing my morning, I had the earphone playing while having a quick breakfast, the left earphone fell out due to my jaws chewing.  The next size larger was uncomfortably pressuring against my canal.  They are heavier than other ones I just ordered to compare against.

- While on my 4.5 mile walk, if I held the phone in my left hand (natural usage), on the slave side ear piece, the stream consistently cut in and out.  This alone was enough to warrant a return and poor review.

- If I had cupped either ear piece with my hand, the left side (slave) would cut out and not return until I removed my hand.  Again, enough to warrant a return.

- When I unlock and lock my screen, the stream would also hiccup.  Annoying enough considering you don't want to accidentally operate the phone in your pocket but there are not enough remote navigation capabilities, you have to unlock your phone to change songs, read random articles, check messages.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Junk,JUNK!!!!!! I purchased this item because it had a lot of good reviews. The left side only worked a couple times. Now it won’t link up. Stay away!,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
exactly what I was looking for!,"I wanted a pair of WIRELESS bluetooth headphones but I just couldn't get myself to buy $150 apple airpods, so I did some research and found these top rated ones on Amazon. Overall, I am VERY impressed and they seem to working great! at first, I couldn't get them to stay in my ears longer than 2 minutes, but then I ended up putting on the smalled ear pieces and now they stay in for most of my workouts. Occasionally I have to re-situate them, but it doesn't bother me that much. The sound quality is great, and noise cancellation and is pretty decent. I love that charging case and that it's portable and easy to carry in a bag/purse. I find that I can get about 6-8 hours worth of listening before having to charge the case. Overall, if you're looking for a nice option of wireless bluetooth ear buds, I highly recommend these. Save that $100 extra that you would spend on airpods toward something else :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Game changer!,"I just got these headphones two days ago and they are amazing. The sound quality is much better than my bulky and more expensive wired headphones.

So far so good,"I recently received these and tested them out over the weekend. So far, they work really well and I love how easy they were to set up and that they're super light weight. The sound quality is clear and is perfect for my everyday use at work and while commuting. I don't typically use both earphones at the same time as I like to be aware of my surroundings but they do cancel noise well if you are using both and that is something you are looking for. I can't really speak to the battery life as I haven't used them for a full day at work yet but so far I am pleased with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for the price,"This is a very good device, sound is very clear and high quality, battery lasts long (for several days I used and did not have to recharge), I use the treadmill at the gym and because the device comes with different sizes of earbuds  I can adjust - actually I need to change for the the smaller size that comes in the package but it never fell down even using a bigger one, but to prevent I will use the other one smaller provided to see of fits better.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would not reccomend,"Thought they were great at first but the longer you have them the more you see wrong with them. They don't sync correctly. I will be watching my phone normally and the next second they connect to these headphones while they are in the charging station.

"Great for the price, last 4hours per charge.","These earbuds had great sound and really good volume, I wear them 6+ hours a day for work in a loud environment and I can hear my podcast and music just fine. I do recommend buying a set of foam eartips as it will make a major improvement in the comfort and sound. I only use one earbud at a time for work, the playback time per charge was 4 hours at 75 % volume. I only used them a few times for calls and everyone was able to hear me but said I sounded a little far away. (I don't care for the call ability, just need them for music) Every once and a while there is a very slight sync issue on YouTube or Netflix but it was hardly noticable.

100% Satisfied,"These earbuds are superb. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity, depth, and quality bass that came from them. The battery life is great, at least 2 hours of nonstop playback before you have to recharge them. The included case is basically a power bank for the earbuds. If the case is fully charged, it can be used to recharge the earbuds up to 4 times, plus it acts as a storage case which is convenient and smart. They pair with my phone within seconds of removing them from the case. I have had zero issues with them falling out. They fit good and come with varying sizes of bud covers. I highly recommend getting a pair of these if you want quality sound, solid design, waterproof earbuds, and don't want to break the bank.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value,"The initial pairing of the Tozo T10s is pretty simple! I really like that they come with multiple size inserts to fit different ear profiles. I spent the first few days of owning them trying out different inserts before settling on the medium size. They aren't noise canceling but when I establish a good seal I have trouble hearing people when they speak to me even if I don't have any audio playing through my ears. Battery life is solid for a several hour study session and they will definitely last for a couple days of moderate use; but I like to charge them nightly with my phone because I'm always using them and I would rather not be inconvenienced with having to charge them during the day and having to have a silent study sesh or workout.
Overall, I have a hard time seeing how these earbuds can be beaten for the price of $50!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great but efficient button function? Where you at?,"as I really love this product there is one thing that sticks out to me and almost bothers me enough to send them back. These earbuds have little to no control on the actual earbuds. While there is a left and a right, they both do the same commands and there’s only four of them. And out of those four commands - three of them deal with taking phone calls. Yes that’s an important part to Bluetooth earphones but I can’t even change my music from the buds...all I can do is play or pause my music. I can redial the last number I called through...which is not helpful. I really felt like they wasted the button functions and left out important functions (like skipping music or restarting a song). I’m sorry but I’ve redialed a number maybe a total of 10 times in my life whereas I skip a song at least three times an hour. I just don’t get how making calls can be more important than having normal functioning buttons for music that are literally on every other pair of Bluetooth earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BEWARE Third Party Seller Tried Slip in Cheaper Earbuds,"I ordered these Tozo T10's and noticed the case seemed rather light to be actually capable of wireless charging. I also had some pairing issues with these. After going to their support page, I noticed the earbuds I received looked different than the ones on their website and this Amazon item. After looking in the Bluetooth menu I did not see ""Tozo T10"" but instead saw ""Xi7 TWS"". A search for this on Google revealed some cheap $10-$13 earbuds that matched the ones I received.

Sound is good but the beeps are annoying,I wanted to like this but just cant! I have had others that are way better and cheaper.

Good Overall Value,"We've had the TOZO T10 TWS BT Earbuds for about a week and they have exceeded our expectations.  They are easy to carry, charge fast, and connect fairly quickly with my phone.  For the price point, they are a good value for a wireless solution when you exercise.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Returning to Amazon for a refund.,"The left ear bud would not stay in my ear. I  made several attempts  and they all failed when inserting the ear bud into my left ear. The left ear bud would  simply fall out of my left ear.  Either walking or while sitting it would not stay in my left ear.I really wanted to like these ear buds however it was a fail for me. The are of a very good quality, and they sound pretty good. However if it wont stay in my left ear they are not worth while to me.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Overall, pretty good.  Has a few quirks which keep it from being 5 Stars","I like the way the ear buds fit and feel.  They connect quickly and easily when removed from the case.  They fit snugly in my ears and don't seem like they will fall out when I sweat or move too much.
There are 2 annoying things that make me question returning them and prevent me from giving 5 stars.
1. If you only use 1 ear bud, it has to be the right one.  This is ok, but when you first take it out of the case and connect it, for the first 2-3 minutes approximately every 15 seconds it will be looking for the other ear bud and beep.  Eventually the beeping stops, but it's annoying.
2. The other issue is connection with the left ear bud.  Randomly (3 times in the approximately 3 hours of listening I've done with them) the left ear bud will drop connection for about 1 second.  It comes back and connects fine, but for that 1 second it seems to glitch and only have sound on the right side.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I’m Amazed,Got this for my son and he loves it. Originally we were gonna buy an Apple Product but thought we try this first.  Very happy with it.  Great fit and love the case with LED indicators.  Do not waste your money on big brands cause you will love this.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty good for the price,"This is the first pair of independent wireless earbuds I have owned and I am pretty impressed. The sound quality is quite good for the tiny package and they get quite loud as well. I love the waterproof part as I bought them for chilling in the hot tub. Have used them in the shower as well to try out the waterproof element of them. The con to them, and there is really only one I can find, is that the left side will often drop out. It is losing the signal from the right side. Doesn't take much at all for this to happen and it will often do so without any obstruction between the left and right sides except your head. Get your hand or arm or something close and it's gone. All things considered though, a very nice product. I love the charging case.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Returned them,"Would never take a full charge. Earbuds would disconnect if they were over 12"" from my phone. I couldn't even put my phone in my pocket before they would disconnect. I had to hold the phone near my head to stay connected. I don't know if I got a defective pair or what.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comparison to existing product,"Jabra Elite vs TOZO T10
Jabra's sound quality is little more sharp but overall volume doesn't go high enough.
TOZO buds are purchased for swimming purpose, it works like a charm. In sound quality perspective, it's base feels a little too loud but it would be because i'm used to using Jabra buds which has low volume in general.

Jabra's product has all these cool features but for work out purpose, I think TOZO fits better. I love IPX8 rating.
Oh, the TOZO's price point is amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buy,Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she loves them. I listened to them for awhile and the sound quality is very good. The battery life has been 3-4hrs listening to music and being able to recharge them with the case is great. They are pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods. She doesn't plan on testing them in water but it's great for piece of mind if caught in the rain or dropped in the tube. I'm probably going to get myself a set also.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
just ran 5k with it,"Just ran 5k with it and DID NOT HAVE TO GIZ IT A SINGLE TIME! Sound quality is amazing, stero is amazing too. I like loud music and honestly I dont past volume 3 with these. Really sound proof. Do yourself a favor and buy it  lol ! I hesitated bc many reviews looked fake, but I'm glad I bought this. Battery life seems good too. The only think is that you cant skip music or answer phone calls if you have an android. And also I didnt figure out how to connect to use only one side (keeps beeping looking for other device to pair)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality for the price point.,"If you are in the market for wireless Bluetooth headphones, I would recommend these. Sound quality is very high for the average person. I have had a co-worker of mine use them, and they have apple air pods, and they have mentioned that the sounds quality was the same if not better.  The earpiece takes some time to get used to. However, there are multiple adjustment pieces. If you are on a budget and need some great headphones, I highly recommend it.  Also based on the shape, they block out a lot of sounds, so they have a noise-canceling effect. I use them at work without playing music just to hear my own thoughts.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Buy!,"I purchased these earbuds for about 1 week now and I love them! I couldn't justify paying for expensive AirPods so went with these and so far I am loving them!! Great sound quality and super user friendly! So far battery life seems to be pretty good, I cannot really attest to logitivity but it worked great when I traveled and on the flight. Thanks Tozo!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud continuously cut on and off [updated],"I really wanted to love these. The sound quality is excellent, they are super comfortable, and I loved the idea of being able to wirelessly charge them. However, they just don't hold up to use. The left earbud CONTINUOUSLY cuts in and out, especially when I am moving, which basically defeats the entire purpose of using them. It's so distracting. I've unpaired and repaired them several times, and even restarted my phone, all to no avail, I've only worn them three times and the problem just keeps getting worse. I was so happy with them at first that I threw away all the packaging and can't even return them. Very disappointing, especially for the price. :( Maybe you'll have better luck.

[update 2/12/19] The seller reached out to me and offered to send me a new pair, which was wonderful, and I added one more star for their customer service (although they did send me way too many emails bugging me about updating my review). Unfortunately, the new pair they sent were even worse than the first, with BOTH earbuds cutting out almost as soon as I placed them in my ears. All in all, these do not work for me.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Skeptical At First,"Because I haven't had good luck with ear buds, I wasn't sure these were for me. After two days of use at the gym for 2 three  hour workouts, the ear buds not only produced excellent sound but were easy to use, cancelling out all outside noise. Loved the price and the charging case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Weak Bluetooth Range Connectivity,The T10s are OK. The sound is good with a nice bass. The battery life is fair. The only big problem which disappointed me is the bluethooth connection. I literally walk 10 feet away from my Samsung galaxy smartphone and the music cancels out. At first I thought it might had been city interference from where my home is located but I have the problem everywhere I go. Even at Starbucks or at at park. I expected more bluetooth range from the T10s to be honest. I seen on here that they had the T6 model launched this year but I had purchased the T10 first without doing further research.  If I would have known the bluetooth connectivity was weak on the T10s then I would had purchsed the T6 instead since reviewers are saying the bluetooth connectivity is much more improved on the T6 earphones.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"I wish the buttons were more useful, but otherwise sold purchase","I wish that double pressing the button on the headset did something more useful that ""redial"" which I 99.999% of the time would never use. Something like, right earpiece does ""forward/next"" and left earpiece does ""back/previous"".",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I'm impressed!,"After a few days of using them, I must say I'm quite happy with the sound quality, the noise cancellation, and the battery life. They're easy to pair up to my phone and are quite comfortable to wear. The only downside was that there's not volume or playback control (i.e. skip ahead, back, etc). HOWEVER...that's something I didn't bother looking for when searching for these, so that's my bad. If you don't mind not having that sort of control, then these are a great buy! And I was surprised to find out that the case charges on a wireless pad. So if you have one, BONUS PERK! I give these 5/5 overall despite the only con I could find...and that's only because I didn't bother to read the description more. No fault of the product itself! I've decided to return these, though, and swap them out for the T6 model which DO have the functions I desire. Can't wait to get them! I'm sure I'll be just as impressed!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Does as promised,"I got tired of pulling cord earbuds in and out all the time, as well as having them accidentally get ripped out of my ears or phone. So far the size options work well and will fit a variety of inner ear sizes, and I am able to hear clearly with them at low volume. It also cancels out outside noise very well and it's easy to pull one out if I need to hear something speaking to me. The only complaint I have with this product is the battery life. I believe the description says the battery life lasts up to 13 hours, but I'm lucky if they last 5. I charge them per instructions and am not sure why they drain so quickly. Overall though I am satisfied with these bluetooth earbuds and do not plan to get anything else.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Maintenance Man Approved!,I ordered these for my husband early Fathers Day. He does maintenance at a State Park and is often doing loud mowing and weed eating. These ear buds are amazing! They drown out background noise and provide great sound. Was also really impressed with the sound quality when using the ear buds to talk on the phone through Bluetooth! Would definitely recommend these!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing quality and sound,The earbuds fit great and the sound is amazing for the price. The noise cancellation is amazing as well. I use them at work and at the gym. They stay in the ear well and don't bother me at all. The mic works better then expected. I did have a problem with one of the earbuds. I contacted the customer support and got a reply the next day. I am very happy over all the the earbuds and the customer support.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound. Good quality. Ease of use.,"I am impressed with the quality of these earbuds. I have been using them regularly, but haven't tried them while swimming, as while they are ""waterproof"" they cannot receive bluetooth signals while submerged. They are easy to insert and stay put if you follow the directions, but I recommend you take the step of accepting the extended warranty and read the slightly more detailed guide to use posted online, which provides a video explaining how the earbuds should be ""set"" in your ear. Every ear is different :-) so it is a good reference. Sound is very good and reception via bluetooth connection works great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
HIGH QUALITY - WORKS GREAT - EASY TO PAIR,"Clear instructions were received with this product. I have no trouble pairing both earbuds to my cell phone or TV! When using with my TV, I place the earbuds loosely in my ears as there is no volume control like there is with my cell phone. Wearing them firmly or loosely in my ear is easy as they rotate once inserted making them very comfortable. Not a real deep bass, but the sound is great and they are very comfortable. Customer service for questions is outstanding.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are the VERY BEST,"I have ordered several other brands of wireless ear buds and returned them all for various reasons. HOWEVER, these are the best I;ve ever owned, wires or wireless. They pair easily, turn on and connect automatically, have great sound including bass. They also have several sized ear canal pads that make them fit perfectly and securely. You won't be sorry if you buy these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, comfort, functionality, and customer service","This product is suuuuuuper high quaility for the price. I had bought some other 50$ pair of Bluetooth earbuds but they were really uncomfortable and had zero bass. So I ordered these to compare. These have a way better fit and sound quality with a higher quality case as well as rubber ear pads. I’m very satisfied. I’m a musician and love to really hear the music regardless of the location, these are great for quality and noise isolation",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Okay...These Things Are *INCREDIBLE*,I usually don't leave reviews but I had to on this one.  These buds are absolutely amazing!!  I'm not planning to take them swimming so the whole waterproof thing doesn't really apply to me but the quality coming out of these little guys is *unreal*.  I have those huge $400 Bose over-ear headphones and the quality is basically identical (only these have deeper bass).  I can't stress enough how amazing these are - ESPECIALLY for the price!  Easily the best headphones I've ever owned.  Will definitely be buying more as gifts.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great sound quality,"While I've only had these earbuds a short time, they seem to be working great!  The sounds quality is really good and you can't beat the price compared to some other earbuds.  I like that they charge in their own case, and that they are waterproof is an added bonus. Would definitely recommend this item!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality and great water resistance - one tip on sound & connection quality,"These earbuds sound very good, and they fit securely in my ears so that I have no worries about them falling out when running or when at the gym.  They seal out environmental noise (so useful when the gym is blasting music I don't like).  They also have proven to be fully waterproof in the shower & the hot tub.

One tip on sound & connection quality: I saw a one-star review on here referring to the sound cutting out. That reviewer noted that the sound / connection would cut out when ""line of sight"" between his phone or smartwatch and the right earbud was blocked by his body or head.  He had to make sure the right earbud was on the same side of his body as the sound transmitting device.  I solved that problem with my Samsung S8 (Bluetooth 5.0) by turning on a Bluetooth option called DUAL AUDIO (Connections-Bluetooth-Advanced-Dual Audio).  I recommend making sure your phone uses Bluetooth 5.0 and has that option before buying.  Otherwise fully recommend this product.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product so far,"After using a neck mounted system for years, this has been a very satisfying change of pace. This model in particular has given me a good performance. The sound quality is good to great about 90% of the time. The biggest issue is while on the phone. I have gotten feedback that it is hard to hear me speaking. The call quality that I hear also leaves me desiring more. Streaming music or using apps is about as close to perfect as I can imagine.  The noise cancellation, to me, seems to more related to how they plug my ears.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the monies.,"I wasn't sure about these, I was afraid they'd fall out of my ears, but they don't. Also, they sound F'n amazing! The audio quality is surprisingly very good, for such a small, cordless device. Very impressed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very happy with my new earbuds!,"Ordered the Tozo earbuds last week and I'm very happy with the quality, value and packaging. The sound is amazing and my daughter has the apple earbuds and I like my Tozo's better. Great battery life and I love the fact that they are water proof.

Quality sound and battery for price,"I have had these for about a month now, and have no real complaints. Love the sound quality and battery life, only drawbacks are the distance it picks up the signal could be better (Usually have no problem leaving it at half court and playing all over the basketball court as long as battery is full) and the pairing process snags every once in awhile.  Definitely worth the money for me, I use it all day at work and then the gym. Dropped a bud into a bowl of Thai Chicken soup and it still works perfect so that’s a plus.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Buy & Product!,Finally got frustrated with my Apple AirPods and their charging each pod at a different rate and not staying in my ears with activities that required constant head movement such as working outside or cycling. I also love the fact that you can use only one ear bud at a time by simply powering on one earbud.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best of the earbuds I've tested so far.,"+ Withstands all my audio needs and high volume needed for factory work.
+ Durable, has survived drops and generally feels solid.
- Does not have a skip feature for music.
- Rose in price over time (Which would be okay given the positives, but it doesn't provide the features or case battery life that other brands offer.)

Despite the negatives, this is an excellent pair of earbuds.
If you don't want to mess around and have to struggle with other brands failing you with defects or bad designs, get these ones!
I've been trying out lots of other pairs to find something better or just as good and it's been a royal pain.

[The Enacfire Future Plus earbuds were the best I've had so far but unfortunately the left earbud was defective. I tried two pairs of them and had the same issue.]

Again, these are still good and robust earbuds. Having not found anything better yet, I'd recommend these ones.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Not for sports, would probably work fine if you use them at home sitting and not moving anywhere.","Terrible and useless for running.

Lasted just 5 months,"These were great for about 5 months. Now, the left ear bud is completely dead. I never dropped it, got it wet, or did anything that could have damaged it.

Earbuds worked when I went to the Water park,I wanted to find wirless water proof ear buds that I could use at the pool or the water parks to listen to music.  These worked great.

Outstanding headphones for an amazing price.,"I had gone looking for a pair of headphones so that I could use them in my off time. Something light weight and easy to carry that wouldn't be too much to handle. I'm happy to say that the Tozo T10 are an amazing pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones. They have a solid connection, good battery life and an amazing carrying case. Now some issues do come in the form of, battery life on the head phones are about 5 hours, the connection can be lost if there is a number of solid objects between you and your device. Now despite all that the carrying case has more than enough battery life to recharge the headphones. even the connection issues can be fixed with just keeping it in your pocket not that of course can't work if you're going swimming. Overall it's a great amazing product not enjoyed using them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great fit, Great Sound, Terrible Bluetooth, Shady company","They worked wonderfully for the first week, fit my ears very well (I have very small ear canals, most others just fall out). These sound better than the other 3-4 true Bluetooth sets I have tried and returned. But, after about 3 weeks or so, they started randomly disconnecting from Bluetooth, losing their connection to each other, etc. Forget about a solid connection if you use these on a bike, and there is even a light wind. With my phone in my pocket I was able to reproduce a Bluetooth disconnection simply by turning my head to the left. Every single time.

After returning my first pair for this issue and getting a second pair, they started doing the same thing immediately. I got an email from the manufacturer offering me a free wireless charger. I replied sure, that would be great, thanks. Then they wanted me to write a positive review before they would send it, I told them no, I have no interest in doing that. They replied that the wireless charger didn't have anything to do with me writing a positive review, but that they wouldn't send it to me until I did so. I told them to leave me alone. They replied asking if I was happy with their product. I responded with my concerns about the terrible Bluetooth connectivity. They replied that they were pleased that I was happy with their product and would I please write a positive review?

So this is me writing a review. They seriously sound and fit better than any other true Bluetooth in ear headphones I've ever used, but the Bluetooth is terrible and the company is terrible.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Cuts in and out when walking, great customer service","These are good for around the office and in the kitchen... I have smaller ears and they fit fine with the smallest tips. When properly in, the sound quality is great. When walking however, these cut in and out... sometimes just the left... sometimes both.... giving a chopping distraction that is annoying. So if you are working out in the gym or in a generally stationary environment, these are great... but if you are going to be walking/jogging.... the choppy in and out can be a serious downside. **update** choppy connections seem to be getting worse - returning for refund. :-(

**addition update** customer service reached out offering to send another product, apparently I may have received just a defective product. Super excited and hopeful that that's the case. Either way, awesome customer service. Will update again. ::fingers crossed::

Update 8/30/19
Quickly received product... again, works great if you arent moving around much. Perfect for the office.... but cuts in and out when walking around the yard. Had phone in my pocket, still cuts in and out as you walk fully charged. Paired with a galaxy s8. So for mobile activity I'm going to have to find another product. :-(
Great customer service though",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Crazy easy to setup, sound great, blocks out the world and really nice portable case","I was a little skeptical mostly because they're competitors are priced much higher. But these headphones have delivered. I use them when commuting to work on my bike, and can only put one in because they cancel noise so well. The setup initially was SUPER easy, and now they pair automatically whenever I remove them from the case. They sound great, battery life seems awesome, the case is extremely portable and feels durable/well made, and they fit super well. They came with four different ear fittings, two of them actually work pretty well for me and the smallest ones work for my wife who usually has a really hard time with earphones.

One thing I've been really impressed with, especially given some other reviews, is the call quality. I cycle to work, it's about an 8-mile commute and my average speed is typically ~20 mph (thanks to the e-bike), which means the wind is whipping and it's a pretty loud commute. In the mornings, I wear a beanie to keep warm, and the beanie totally covers the earphone. The other day, I was on a call from the start of my commute to the end, with beanie on, and the call quality on both sides was flawless. The person I was talking to decided to buy them after the call because she was so impressed with it on her side.

For $50, or honestly for $100 if they were priced higher, these are worth it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Overall good, but a bit fatiguing with some glitches.","Good overall sound, and a great stereo image. Lots of clarity in the mid range, more so than most. But there’s a huge bass boost that is a bit distracting. I had to play with the iPhone settings to find a setting that made for a less muddy/masking bass response. Before I found a good setting I felt that that bass boost was heavily masking the low mids above the bass and kick. I also find them a bit ear fatiguing because of the built in EQ curve. I’m coming from a music studio background and am used to stellar monitoring headphones so that could be coloring my opinion. There are also ocasional little glitches between the headphone sides where one side cuts out for a split second.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Initially Great, until left ear bud stopped charging and working","For the first 3 months I had these they were great, easily paired with my phone and Chromebook, used them to listen to music at work, take calls, listen to podcasts while walking my dog, and even listen to the news in the shower without bothering my wife.  I also used them when using power tools to protect my hearing.

Love the earbuds - truly waterproof,"I have had the earbuds for about 3 weeks now, and they are great. Good sounds, clarity, and even works well to talk on the phone! I was down b  by the lake and one of the earbuds fell in about 3' of water. I was lucky to be able to find it after about 2-3 minutes and reached into the water and retrieved it. I thought I had probably ruined it. I shook it off let it dry  for a few hours, put it in the charging case and then tried a could of hours later. Powered up just fine, and is still working today.

Best bang for the buck wireless headphones,"I've used these headphones for about 2 weeks now and they are great for working out. Honestly didn't know how annoying the cord was until it was gone, and they really are easy to pair and use.

Great earbuds for a great price,"I really enjoy these earbuds.  I have been using them for about a week now.  They have been working very well so far.

I have experienced an occasional dropoff with the bluetooth signal, but it has lasted for about second and then comes right back - I am not sure if it is because of my phone or the earbuds.  It has been extremely rare, so I am still happy.  I would definitely recommend this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bass! Great Volume! Great Music/Microphone Quality!,"Earbuds: They sound great. I LOVE THE BASS. If you search a a battle scene on youtube and put these headphones in...it feels like your in the movie theater. The bass is good an deep. I love them. I don't have any issues with them connecting to my phone. The treble is a little weak but I think a quick adjustment in your phones settings will do the trick. The volume is also plenty loud. I never but them up all the way.

Mic: I have no issues with the mic quality at home or in my car. The volume also gets plenty loud as well. Even on the highway the mic dosnt seem to pick up a ton of background noise. You can use one or both earbuds! This was huge deal for me! Alot of these other earbuds will only do one ear and dont get loud enough.

Case: Case is a little big but it does have wireless charging and feels like great quality. Lid is transparent so you can see the lights underneath. They also come with a small lanyard if you so choose to put them on the case. Opening and closing the case is also satisfying. The lid closes via magnets.

Overall I think these are the best headphones for the price. I have tried multiples different pairs in this price range. Other brands I tried were Cowin and Jlabs. Id recommend these over everything else in this price range! I also tried the airpods from apple and I still like these better!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great sound and fit! A must buy!,"I bought these based on the reviews. The reviews were awesome. But, I really felt like the reviews were too good to be true.

These earbuds come with several sets of earpieces to ensure you get the proper fit. They are small and discrete and tuck nicely into the ear and they stay in while running and working out and sweating. I use them not only to listen to music and watch Netflix on my phone but also for hands free talking in my car and they work great.  The charging carrier has a built in charger bank that keeps the earbuds charged after being unplugged from a power source.  I bought mine on a Prime lightning deal and got them even cheaper than the regular price. Talk about a bargain. So they get 5 stars. A definite buy for anyone looking for awesome, wireless earbuds on the cheap. I have had mine since Christmas and they are working great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best wireless earbuds I have owned! And I have owned a few...,"These are amazing! I had the last version of these (the T8) and loved them as well, but these are more comfortable and sound a little bit better (the others sounded excellent). Multiple sizes of cushions, and when you select the correct size they STAY in place, no worries of them falling out. LOTS of bass, very clear and awesome sound. I would absolutely recommend these! Havent tested battery life to the limits, but I fell asleep with them in and they were still playing when I woke up at least two hours later. The case on the T10 is MUCH better quality than the T8 (the previous version). I assume they will charge the headphones a ton before needing to plug them in just based on the size of the case. I have owned JLab, JBL (2 versions), Sony and a couple of other major name brands and these are superior. OH and the ""ok Google/hey google"" function actually works great as well! The microphone for calling is OK, but it IS far from your mouth and with that in mind it is great. I only got these because TOZO customer service gave me half off for warranty purposes from my T8 version I loved (charging issue). They swapped out the charging case (fast shipping too!) to see if that would solve my problem, but it didnt, and they offered replacement or half off the new headset. Excellent FAST customer service. I had low expectations with an ""off brand"" headset, but I'm a customer for as long as they keep producing quality headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Something got stuck inside my ear!,"Be careful, this small piece might get stuck inside your ear (see picture) and I had to get it out with the help of someone. It was a pain. Thank God I didn't have to go on emergency.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bluetooth Connection Issues,"Not sure why, but I could never get a solid Bluetooth Connection from the pair I received. Seems like every time I would turn my head or move at all, it resulted in a disconnected response? After several attempts of re-positioning and turning the pieces on and off, I eventually sent them back. Seems like a solid piece for how much the purchase price is, just needs some tweaks here and there. Currently listening to the Jabra Active Elite 65T!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
2 defective pairs and Amazon won't honor the warranty,"I've had 2 pairs of these headphones and both pairs broke within a couple months. The sound quality was great, they were very comfortable but only worked for a couple of months. The first pair started out great but after a couple of months the left earbud started to have static constantly. I contacted amazon and had them send me a replacement since I did sign up for the warranty.  The second pair, after another 2 months or so the right earbud just stops working, it won't connect to the left earbud or any device. I just contacted amazon they told me they won't replace them again even though they are defective. Apparently, there is a limit of one replacement even when the product is defective. When they work, the earbuds are great but I've had 2 pair now that just stopped working properly and can't get a replacement even though they are under warranty. I figured I just ended up with a couple of defective pairs and wanted to to have them replaced with a set that isn't going to break after a couple months since otherwise they were perfect but amazon won't help.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bang for the buck!,"I was looking for some new wireless ear-phones that would be comfortable in my ears and have some good bass.
I was initially looking at ones that cost $100+, but I read a lot of great reviews for these and decided to check them out. If I didn't like them I could always just send them back and get the (much) more expensive ones.
Well, I'm happy to say that these things are great!
They're very comfortable in my ears and stay put while I'm working out at the gym.
Just as importantly, they sound excellent! For small ear-phones they have nice bass, with a good punch! Maybe a bit bright in the upper end, but that's easily adjusted with my phones equalizer! The mid range is also very good.
All in all, I don't think that you will be able to find better ear-phones than these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sounding earbuds + water resistance,"I am quite impressed with this pair of earbuds. First, the sound is great. There's a good balance of bass, the mids, and the highs. The low frequencies do not drown out the mid and high's. Second, the earbuds are water resistant. One of the earbuds accidentally fell into my sink that had about 1/2 water in it. I picked it up after it was emersed in water, dried it with a towel and it still works! So, I don't worry about the earbuds going bad after walking several miles on my treadmill. Third, the earbuds can be charged in a charger that has wireless charging capability. I don't have to repeatedly insert into the charger the micro USB cable that comes with the earbuds. Fourth, when I'm done listening, I put the earbuds back into the charger and they automatically turn off and disengage from my iphone/ipad/macbook pro mid-2012. I have not tried other earbuds, but I'm quite satisfied with these earbuds based on the reviews and how the product has been functioning thus far.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Finally, earbuds that charge wirelessly!!","These were just what I was looking for! Wireless earbuds that could be used one at a time, in a case that will charge off my new phone wirelessly. They sound awesome and don't cut out at all like other wireless earbuds I've tried. Will see how the batteries hold up, and how long the ear buds and case stay charged between uses. So far so good!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Fit well, great customer service","I've had problems with other wireless earbuds, but these actually stay in my ears while running.  The sound is good, although for my purposes comfort is really more important.  I had a problem with the right earbud after about 6 months of use, and the customer service was great.  They responded right away and are sending a replacement.  I'm very happy with these and would buy them again.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice n Loud as compared to others. Good sound,"Great Earbuds!! I’m somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to headphones and I’ve tried about 5 different wireless buds. These sound the best and loudest in my opinion. I like my music loud. They’re still not as loud as a nice set of wired buds but are certainly better then others I’ve tried. Connectivity seems good, battery life is about 3 hours continuous. Charging case is weird it has full power then after 1 charge it’s down to the 1/3 or 4. Could just be the indicator light. Overall great!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome little headphones for the price,"Bought these for work so I wouldn't have to mess with a cord and I will never buy a regular pair of earbuds again thanks to these. They come with a nice case that charges the earbuds even after you unplug the charger.(which has wireless charging!) Charges pretty fast. They earbuds themselves are a high quality small design and last a long time. I was listening to podcasts over an 8 hour shift and they never died. Listening to music you get about 4 hours, still pretty good. The sounds quality is average but has decent bass. Paring is super easy and fast. They fit very good and haven't  fallen out of my ears at all. The only negative thing I could say is they cause a little discomfort after hours of wearing them, but I probably shouldn't have them in that long anyway :D Would buy again or for a friend. Would make a great gift.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality,"These provide a very good sound quality and easily connected to my iPhone.  The charging case provides on the go flexibility.  Provides multiple size ear pads.  My only issue (and its a big one) is that they are constantly falling out of my ears, even after going to the smallest size in the ear piece selection pack. This might be something most users will not have an issue with, but they just have not worked out for me.  I gave it 4 stars primarily because the product itself is very good and hopefully will work out for most users.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
defect left and right earbud connection,"I tried the wireless earbuds out of the box and found the problem of intermittent sound from the left earbud, missing more than 50% sound. Contacted Amazon for advise and they send me a replacement set. The new one won't behave any better. Wrote to company support but no response received. The takeaway is that if you need a quality wireless earbud, this is not the one. However the package is well designed and easy to use.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"So far so good, intelligent purchase","Phone used is the Pixel 3
1. Love wireless charging, when done just set them on the flat charger and forget.... no fiddling around with cords.
2.  Fit nicely, several different ear bud options change out...I went with the smallest.  They don't feel heavy and stay in working weight bench, stair stepper, haven't run with them yet... I have a few more months of rehab before that..
3. They connected with each other right away, and are also quick to connect to the phone and take over sound duties, pretty much right away. With other products, it would show connected on the phone, but the sound would continue to come out of the phone speaker and I would have to randomly push buttons and turn on and off to work right.  Not these, right away...connect and sound.
4. No cords between them is great, no accidentally hooking a cord and having them yank out of your ear... of send your phone scooting down the treadmill(still not running...several other product experience)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Subpar,You can’t go far.. I bought these to go swimming ... well when I get to the other end of the lap pool I can’t hear ish so the range quality not good.  They do work under water and the battery life sucks!,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Awesome sound, great battery life, great customer service!","The sound on the these is awesome, as many reviews have said, deep bass, great highs, and perfect mids.  I have had a few people try them and they have ordered them as well.  My wife had me order her a pair yesterday as well.
The battery time is great, especially with the case for charging.  What swayed me to these is the wireless charging feature, and the reviews of the sound.
The company has reached out to me a few times checking on how I feel with their product, this goes a lot farther than the quality of the earbuds themself.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding and affordable,"Love these and would definitely buy again. In fact, I already did! This is my second pair of the T10 wireless earbuds; I misplaced my first pair about a couple months after using them almost every day and enjoying every minute. Then couldn't find them and couldn't live without them so had to buy another pair! So reasonably priced, I didn't even flinch at getting a second pair (though still hoping I find the first pair!)

Sound quality is excellent, especially if you like your bass as I do. Bluetooth pairing is quick and easy and the connection is rock solid with my phone in front, side or back pocket. I love how they connect to my iPhone 8 immediately after taking them out of the charging case! The sound isolation is really great (I often use these instead of earplugs when running outdoor power equipment including mowers, blowers and chainsaws).

Wireless charging of the case is super convenient, though it seems to charge slightly faster when plugged in (I have a Mophie charging pad). Still, a GREAT feature on such an affordable product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super happy with my new earbuds!,"I was apprehensive to buy earbuds because I was afraid I would lose them, was worried about the sound quality,  and was afraid that the microphone wouldn’t work well while on calls.
 I’m so glad I Purchased these!  The sound quality is awesome, the microphone works crystal clear on calls, and love that the carrying case holds extra battery charges for my earbuds and keeps me from loosing them.
 Totally worth the money!
 I haven’t tried them in water yet.  I am a swimmer so this is a feature I was looking for. So the fact that I can is a bonus.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
For a fraction of airpods and much better!,"The thing that stands out is that I almost got 5 hrs of continuous playing time (on medium volume) out of these. Very important to me! I didn't try to charge it with the case for 15 minutes to get another 1.5 hrs but will definitely try that out at some point. They are comfortable (haven't figured out my perfect tips yet but the default medium were a good fit so far), sound/base is good, wireless charging case, extended one year warranty if you register to top it off and they DON'T cost $180 vs brand names.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Muffled Calls & Poor Fit,"My review is based on the fact that these earbuds I was excited about because they've had great reviews, but after changing through all of the different size earbuds they don't fit me well. Not only that, but everyone I've called have told me that my voice sounds muffled no matter what way I orient the headphones. I essentially have to yell in order for my voice to be clear on the other side. The battery time is excellent though and haven't had the chance to really test the waterproofing as I've only worn this for a few days now, but disappointed in these.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Pretty good quality, great at the price","These are my first Bluetooth earbuds, although I've had several BT speakers and one BT headset for office use, so my grade reflects my new-ish-ness to this type of product.

That said, I'm very happy with them. The pairing and setup are relatively foolproof, and the battery life has been sufficient for my usage over the first week+ of use. (Primarily, they've been used while watching movies on my iPad, so up to 2.5 hours continuous use leaves some power to spare.) The sound quality is good, though I may increase that to 5 stars as I get more experience and make alterations to the source EQ. Noise cancellation is as good as any earbuds I've ever owned, particularly once I finally figured out which sice of pads to use.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Acceptable for the price.,"Reasons why I returned mine:

- Flashing blue light on the side when on - I only noticed these when I was using them at night and saw my room being lit up at about a 5 second interval. Because the two buds are not paired at the same time, the buds flash independent of one another (not at the same time). I prefer something more subtle and would rather not piss off someone I'm sitting next to when on the plane or train.

- Voice over is annoying. On removal of the buds from the charging case, there will be a woman's voice saying that the device has been turned on, right ear connected, left ear connected, etc. Similarly, when turning the devices on/off manually by holding the button on the side, it'll beep and say device on/off. Super
unnecessary, things like this should be seamless - just remove it from the case and start the music.

- Connection drops out - over the course of about an hour and half walking throughout NYC, the connection dropped off two times. It managed to auto-fix itself without having to do anything, but still a slight annoyance.

- No volume control on the buds themselves.

- Not too fond of the fit despite trying all bud shapes. You're supposed to turn these at an angle toward the back of the ear but it still didn't feel that secure. It fell out once when walking as I raised my arm and brushed my ear lightly. I can't really compare it to other wireless buds as this was my first pair. The standard corded apple earbuds are still my go to.

Good points:

- It'll last at least 2 hours per charge as I haven't tested it for longer.

- Call quality/mic seem to be okay. I've only tested them with ~a minute long call.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Water resistant, pretty good sound, but not impressed by the battery","I bought these along with a cheaper set of bluetooth ear buds at the same time.  Of the two I prefer the cheaper set.

On the plus side, the sound quality on these is pretty good, they have reasonable volume, and the range is acceptable. I tried them in the shower once and they seemed to be fine afterward, so the water resistance thing seems to be legit.

On the down side, even if I don't use them at all and leave them in the case, the battery level drops quickly (the case and buds will both run completely dead in about a week even if unused).  The cheaper set I bought lasts longer with a smaller case when I use them every day.

These aren't particularly comfortable for me, even after trying the different tips.

Also, when connected and in use there is a blue LED that flashes periodically from each earbud.  In a dark room it is bright enough to see it shining against the walls to your side.  I'd prefer the LED off when in use.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Bass is amazing,"For how small these are, the bass is amazing.  They fit snug in the ear and when bending or chewing they stay put.  The connection is great.  The right pairs with the left automatically.  Sometimes I only wear just the right side because of my work environment, having to hear other things, but even then the sound is satisfying.  The charge last about 4 hours. Just in time for lunch for them to charge in the handy self charging case.  Then we're ready to go again for the rest of the day.  Actually just bought a second pair for my son.  He works out and loves them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Earbuds,"I originally wanted to buy the apple air pods, but they were too expensive, so I thought I might as well take a shot at these.  Right now, I'm so glad that I did. These earbuds are amazing from the bass, to the amazing highs and lows. I asked one of my friends that have air pods to compare the two and I was surprised when she told me that these were actually better. If you're wondering whether you should buy it or not, the answer is buy it, its 100 worth every dollar, Im surprised that they aren't charging more.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them! They work great!,"Somehow amazon sent me the wrong color, but this was very quickly corrected and in 2 days I had the correct color sent to me!

Left stopped working- Updated,"After using with no problems for less than month left ear bud fades in and out, static or no sound at all.
Before that they were great but useless now.
I guess I will try to return through Amazon.
Update: I was outside the return window for Amazon but Tozo customer service did replace with a new pair. Kudos to Tozo customer service!
I used the new pair hard and heavy for a few days to test out. Swam in pool (did not totally submerge but they did get wet), mowed the lawn, rode my bike, etc. No problems surfaced.
Came with different sizes of ear inserts and I did switch out for the next smaller size. Fits snugly in ear, not noise canceling but does block out most ambient noise. Sound is excellent, true stereo.
Pairs to my device without issues. Voice inside tells what is happening ""power on"", ""paired"", ""second device paired"", etc.

Best true earbuds for the price!!,"Work and sound great! Mine didn't include the extra ear tips, but I contacted them and they are on the way.

They are wonderful for listening to music or books or whatever. The sound is clear, can get quite loud, and they have better bass than others I've tried close to this price.

One caveat, like all true wireless earbuds I've tried, they are not so good for phone calls. They work, but you need to speak clearly & louder than any background noise to be understood.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

A Quality Product. Love it.,"I've been searching for a true wireless earbuds for a while. I'm happy to report the search is over. I am very impressed with this product! Even the packaging and manuals inside are quality. The charging case feels sturdy and has a good weight to it. It closes using magnets, and it is strong enough that it won't open accidentally. The earbuds fit nicely, and there are different sizes for the tip for a comfortable fit. It is incredibly easy to pair the earbuds, and once paired they always automatically connect to your phone when taken out from the case. When you remove them and put them back on the case they disconnect automatically. The sound is rich and there is some good base going on there! It's also nice that you can pause and play music pressing the button on any of the earbuds. The fact that it is also waterproof, including the case, and that it can charge wirelessly, it's just the cherry on top. It's a no brainer for me to recommend this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Works great, right out of the box.","I was worried that these weren't going to fit my ears very well since the Apple earbuds just don't fit my ears. They come with different size ear buds and fit great. Sound quality is outstanding with deep bass and great spectrum overall. The other thing I was worried about is that these were going to feel 'heavy' in my ears, since they're larger than earpods, but they fit great and don't become annoying after a while.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I like the charging case, seems to be good quality
The ear buds appear to have good build quality.

My one ""issues"" is that they do not stay in my ear for long periods without me pressing them back in. This is why I gave 4-stars instead of 5. I would rate 4.5 if I could. Should I find some trick to adjustment in the ear, I come back and change the review.

Overall I'd say I'm pleased with the product.

Updated! I raised the rating to 5-Stars.
Customer service is excellent. They sent additional Pieces for the ear. i still have an issue with it staying in the for extended period of time. But that must be me. The product works very well.

At last! Wireless earbuds that work!,"After trying another brand of wireless earbuds (4 different sets!), I read the reviews and thought that I would give the Tozo T10 a try. They worked! RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX! BOTH sync up and connect immediately, and once I pull up my wireless device screen on my phone, connects to that smoothly! What a difference from the previous brand!

I think the sound is great.

Not so much noise cancelling, but I use them while walking my dog, and I need to be able hear sounds around me.

The for is a bit odd because they feel as if they are going to fall out, but they don't.

I sometimes get a sounds delay if I try to user then while watching TV because the synchronization is off, so I wear them while working out, listening to podcasts.

"Unpack ‘Em, Stick ‘Em In Yer Earholes, and They Just WORK","I am always happy to review a product that exceeds expectations. I purchased these on a hunch because I was impressed with the reviews. I’ve always wanted some really good wireless Bluetooth earplugs that fit solidly in my ear and deliver good sound. If I am Romeo, then I have now found my Juliet.

The first thing I tried of course, was to see if they fit. Perfect, right out of the box. They are more in-ear than they are “pods.”
Second, are they easy to set up? Yes, they are; in fact they pair themselves together without even being asked. They pair with iPhone/Pad using standard procedure.
The sound is rich and full.  I bought these for podcasts, but tested them on “Fat Bottom Girls” and “Working on the Highway.”  Passed with flying colors.  Spoken-word clarity is first-rate.
All parts appear to be solid and very good quality.  Some earlier reviewers found the instructions hard to decipher, but Tozo has apparently hired a bonafide English-speaker since then.

Better than any waterproof earbuds I've tried,"These Tozo earbuds are the fourth pair of earbuds that I have tried, having had issues with the first three pairs within weeks of purchasing them. The sound is awesome and the fit is great. They are comfortable to wear while laying in bed. They are as waterproof as I need them to be, having taken them into both the shower and the pool with no issues. I do not have any issues with them cutting out, as others have reported. Following the instructions of the manufacturer, connection to each other, and then to my devices was quick and easy. My biggest issue is if I want to use just one, the other one cannot be placed back on the charger, as the Bluetooth signal between earbuds is disconnected, but I can still use just one as long as I store the other outside of the charger...no big deal. And like I said, considering these little things, they still work better than anything else I've tried, even those costing more money.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

A lot to say but I will highlight the sound that is very clear,"The earbuds arrived so quickly in the mail. I charged it fully and paired it with my phone and started using it.

I recommend it to new shoppers 👌",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Customer Service,"I bought these in May, and they worked great for a week. I after a week, the left earbud began to cut in and out. Well, now anytime I wear these while doing yardwork, running, or working out, the left earbud cuts out completely, for a solid 30-45 seconds each. Not very happy about these. Had great sound quality, blocked out noise, and were easy to use. I just wish they worked. I wouldn't recommend these earbuds. Save up and buy the Samsung Gear earbuds.

UPDATE:
Tozo reached out to me, and sent me a brand new pair. I decided to give them to my little sister, and she absolutely loves them. They're working great and aren't having any issues yet. Their customer service was quick to respond and quick to replace them. They really do care about their customer relations, that's for sure. I stay rather busy, and they've been wanting me to update my review, if I was satisfied. I was, and so...here's my updated review. Give 'em a shot, you'll like these ear buds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Wonderful Audio Quality, Strange Button Functions","All in all, a very nice product. The waterproofing lives up to standard, the case charges the earbuds very quickly and charges quickly itself, they feel nice in your ears and they don't fall out easily.
My only problem with them is that the button functions only allow you to pause and play the music, there is no way to change the song with them. Double-clicking the button typically does this on other headsets with controllers, but I quickly found that that redials the last number you called for some strange reason. You also cannot change the function of the buttons, and they're all geared toward phonecalls and not music.

The bass is exceptional, but the treble is somewhat sharp at times and maxes out if the volume is too high. The mic quality is standard, and both eaebuds have one although I'm not sure what for, as only the right one is needed.

They are just about perfect for the price tag, and after I bought these, I got another pair for my brother. Definitely reccomend if you're new to true wireless and don't want to worry about the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earbuds,I love these new earbuds. They are very comfortable and the sound is amazing.  Haven't worn in pool but will soon.  Great fit didn't have to change the tip.  So convenient to be able to just use one or both earbuds.  Pairing was simple and quick.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing product for the price!!!,"I bought these for my son for his birthday and I ordered too late so we didn’t get them in time. I went to the store to buy a different brand and kept these for myself. I was so impressed with the quality of these, I always have a difficult time with any type of ear bud they always irritate my ears and I can never wear them long term. I don’t have that problem with these! In fact after a week of my son using the more expensive ones I bought at the store we returned them and got a second pair of these! I honestly thought that at this price it was too good to be true but these earbuds are amazing! The sound quality is great, they really do block out other noise and they are comfort. The battery life seems to be great as well. I have never had them doe on me so that is a plus! I would recommend these to anyone looking for great quality wireless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product,"Would have given this 5 stars except it did not come with interchangeable ear buds and the standard ones where too big. Had to buy different ear pieces. Otherwise, sound quality is great and still highly recommend",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Five star quality Bluetooth earbuds!!!!,"Everything about these headphones are five star, the sleek design, they fit perfectly in my ear and block out all other noise. The sound quality and bass is better than some “designer brand” earbuds.
The charging case is awesome, as wireless charging becomes a huge convenience.
They are worth every penny.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cool product with very good sound,"My daughter really likes these. The charging pod is a nice design. They sound very good. My biggest concern before i got them was would they stay in her ears when she was running, but that's not an issue.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They sound is great the battery life is great,"I read a review on this product from another website. That user recommended it for a variety of reasons important to me. So, I took a chance and bought. I was not dissatisfied. I tried several other pairs from others and they all went bac. The best thing about the T10's is that the bass is excellent. I will try them on an airplane next month.

Battery life is great but it's not especially important to me because the T10's recharge when they are placed back in the carrying case, even without it plugged in.

Couldn't wait to get these....,"Order arrived quickly, nicely packaged...great service from seller.

Charged them up prior to use, paired instantly, and the sound is terrific.

Perfect amount of bass and treble for my listening preferences.

Feels comfortable in my ears, and easily  drowns out external sounds without having to have the volume cranked-up all the way.

But it's nice to know that you can crank it up without distortion.

I like the various choices of color...I got the white ones... (easier to find)... Lol

Overall, a very positive purchase, and a very happy customer.

Thank you TOZO.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Choice if you prefer superior sound from In-Ear style,"If you're like me and find the hard-sided ""AirPod"" style earbuds incapable of reproducing deeper bass sound, this is the choice for you.

"Great headphones, minutes the auto pairing issue","Some of my favorite headphones I’ve ever used, the wireless charging is pretty great and the several earbud sizes they come with help you find the right size so they’ll stay in, I could go about a week without charging them and would take them out while riding my bike. I liked them so much I bought another pair after losing one earbud during a fall off said bike. My only complaint with these is that they don’t pair automatically to my iPhone and I have to go into settings to pair them manually, otherwise sound quality and case are amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great wireless earbuds for the $$$,"These buds are better than many wired ones I've bought before. I was really hoping the bass response would be good, and imo it is. For the price point, I'd say I'm extremely pleased with this product. And many other reviewers also believe as I do, that TOZO cares about their consumers opinions. It's things like that, that will win me over more times than not. I might even buy another pair. Aw work pair and a home pair. I'm also interested in buying the fast charger, it looks like a great deal as well. I would recommend these earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Wireless Earbuds and Customer Service,"Very impressed. I got these for my wife but now that I tried them out I want a pair for me too. Ditch the wires and try these. Great price too.

Great sounding ear buds,"Great sounding ear buds! I had no issues pairing with both my iPhone 7 and iPad. I like the wireless charging option and being able to see through the lid to track the ear bud charging progress. See second picture.

The ear buds come with four different sizes of ear cups. I used the second to smallest size because they fit my ear canal the best and held the buds securely in my ears.

I am not sure if I need the ear buds to be waterproof but it can’t hurt.

Very happy with the purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great for working out in the water, but not swimming.","I bought these for working out in the pool, and they are the best headphones for working out in the water that I've found. The battery life is true to the advertising. The only problems I've run into are pairing and distance.  Occasionally the headphones will pair with each other but not the phone, and if you go more than a 1/2 pool length away from the phone, the signal cuts in and out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, good battery, good price.","I've been looking for truewireless earbuds for a while that weren't over $100.
they are pretty good for their price. i was surprised by the good sound quality and great battery life. was a little disappointed with the noise cancellation, but nothing bad enough to change my opinion on them.

i only have 2 problems with these earbuds
1: I'm not a big fan of the design, the way the weight is on the top of the earbud can sometimes make it easy for them to fall out.

2: to make them stay in your ear, the part that goes in your ear canal is super long, so its pretty deep within your ear.

BUT i have large ears and ear canals. so this may just be a personal problem. a solution id like to see is maybe earbuds with a wing that goes into your concha cymba of your outer ear. just a idea ;)

overall, i am happy with my purchase. and see high potential in this company and will be buying their products again.
so if you're looking for cheaper, but good earbuds, i recommend these :)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

All is clear now,"I am totally surprised how much I love my new ear buds!!! I was expecting to ship them back the next day. I’ve tried several in this price range and they were cheap and the sound quality was awful...the are crystal clear!  The base is a little heavy in some songs but that doesn’t bother me a bit. When talking in them, I ask the people on the other end and they say I’m very clear!!!
Loved the different size ear covers too as I have small ears. 100% happy with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"AirPods?  No thanks, check these earbuds out.  You won’t be disappointed!","Disclaimer: I haven’t taken them for a true spin at the gym, shower, etc.  Used them around the house and the range is effected by solid objects which is understandable.

Only time will tell but these earbuds are quite the budget friendly option.  I don’t have any issues, I love them!!!

Case is very convenient, practical, and intuitive with its opaque cover that displays the charge indicators for both the earbuds and case itself.  The ergonomics are really nice.  If your looking for something wireless and on a budget, take a hard look at these and buy them!

Sound quality while I don’t have a real knack for music or anything I enjoy them tremendously.  The earbuds have built in noise canceling properties, at least in my mind.  I only have to them at about 25% on my phones max volume to enjoy the music and block out background noise.

I had an issue with the earbuds syncing to my laptop but with a little fuss, figured out that it’ll read each earbud independently (“L”and “R” in my devices page) if the earbuds don’t sync first to one another.  So be a little patient let them do there thing and then click the “R” designated earbud.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for those that want good quality at a good price,"These Bluetooth earbuds are pretty good for the price. I use them when I go workout and they stay in my ear throughout the entire time. These earbuds are great for those that want a premium set without paying the premium price.

One thing I would like to point out is that they are great for listening to audio, they don't really excel at making calls. The feedback I've gotten from the few calls I've made so far is that you can hear a lot of background noise. I suppose being at the gym didn't help. But overall I'm very satisfied with the T10s.

Last bit, the wireless charging feature is super convenient! Just drop the case on the charging pad and you're good to go 👍!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very affordable high quality earbuds,"I don't normally have the time to write a review of a product but felt like I had to do it for the Tozo Earbuds. For the price, I was not sure I was going to get any headphones of quality but was pleasantly surprised when I received them. Just as advertised they paired simpler than any other Bluetooth device I have had. They fit comfortably in my ears not loose or too tight. The sound quality is also very good. I also found the range to be a little better than advertised I have been away from my phone 2 levels and still getting sound. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable high-quality Bluetooth earbud, you won't be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good reviews... Bad product...,I thought with all the good reviews that these would be my answer to a good quality product... I was wrong. They cut in and out approximately 6 times in 3 minutes at the gym. Which is to bad because I really liked the design of the product and the case. Unfortunately they do not work for use in a crowded gym... Returned..,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great earbuds, very convenient and highly recommended","First time experience with any wireless earbuds and TOZO T10 really impressed me and works wonderfully. I will happily recommend this to any of my friends who are looking for one.
Few things that I feel can be be improve is the battery life(considering the fast charging it’s not absolutely required), song navigation(it will be awesome if we can do next/rev which will make life easier for the fans).
Being said that, after all what we need is great sound, good range wireless earbuds to transcend into whole another world!! Highly recommended for music lovers 👍",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent headphones reviews slightly misleading,So I’ve been looking for new wireless earbuds for a while I was almost dead set on waiting for the price to drop on sonys newest WF-1000XM3 but after losing my air pods I finally made the jump to buy something now. These for sound quality is mediocre granted I only used my AirPods at work to listen to music or watch a quick YouTube video but that’s what these are replacing and comparably these don’t sound nearly as clean even with the noise cancellation factor of them being all the way in your ear. Now do they sound good for a $50 WIRELESS earbud yes better than expected honestly. Now build quality wise they’re pretty good nothing exceptional but they don’t feel cheap either. As for the case it’s a different story feels like cheap plastic case and it’s bulkier than I anticipated. I was hoping for something smaller but I may just have been spoiled by apples AirPods. When it comes to comfortability I definitely will say for someone with really small ear canals even using the smallest rubber fittings they’re pretty uncomfortable they hurt my ears after about 30 mins of use and now you can take that with a grain of salt because I have avoided wearing these style in ear ear buds for a long time for that fact alone I would suggest picking up a memory foam fitting if you plan on wearing these for longer periods of time. But all in all a decent pair of total wireless earbuds for the price I don’t think I’d buy another pair if I lost these though I’d either go back to AirPods or look for something else maybe worth a few more dollars from a reputable brand like skullcandy jbl sennhesier Bose or Sony.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value & Convenient,These earbuds are exactly what I was looking for. I wanted some wireless earbuds to wear when I’m using my ‘shorty’ motorcycle helmet. These TOZO buds work great.

**Update** Stopped working after a couple of weeks.. was: Surprisingly Great earbud find,"**Update**
I really like the product and the concept. I got real bad news.. it stopped working for me :(. Amazon and Tozo have great customer service which is why I cannot give it one star because they are really trying to take care of me. However, I returned my first earbuds when the left earbud stopped responding. I sweat alot, and while I was working out lots of sweat came into my ears and the the left bud stopped responding. I contacted support and researched how I can fix this. They were helpful in trying to reset it, but no response from the earbud. I tried to recharge it in the case, and still no response. Tozo and Amazon then sent me a replacement and I sent back the non-responding pair of earbuds. Fast forward 2.5 weeks later and my left earbud of the replacement died again. Same situation, same attempt to resurrect. I really want to love this product with its nifty wireless recharging feature, decent sound, and comfort for my ears, but the earbud is not working. I am torn if I should get a 3rd replacement or just give up with my head down. I hope I can update this review with putting more stars back up and say how great the product is and the third time is a true charm.

Original Post
On a whim, I purchased these earbuds so I can go in long walks and listen to my music or news. I didn't expect much for the relatively low price I paid.

That said, it was one of the easiest things I ever paired with my very complicated bluetooth on my Samsung s9. It took less than 2 mins. Following this initial setup, connecting to my phone has been and continues to be seamless to the extreme...like it was made by Samsung.

When I first listened to a wide variety of music, the sound was a little metallic which is why it's 4 stars. But when I was listening while taking a shower, WOW!!! Suddenly the bass was deep and crisp. The higher frequencies lost their metallic sound and is almost like real high quality speakers. This is when I realized I need to spend time teying the different fittings to achieve that perfect sound that these earbuds are capable of. Do I higjly recommend? Absolutely.!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Very good earbud, Great Customer Service","I bought these for my wife, they fit well, stay in place, comfortable, good sound. Pairing is quick and automatic. Great units.

Update 4/13/19: Still working great.

Update 5/17/19: Dog chewed up one, I asked Tozo customer service if I could buy a replacement but they don’t sell just one. They did offer a significant discount on a new set which I took them up on. The new ones are great BT 5.0, full waterproof.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Reliable pairs of bluetooth earphones with good sound quality. Great customer services.,"I wanted a pair of Bluetooth earphones for office use. I did extensive research on Amazon as there are so many options.

I decided to go with Tozo and I’m glad i did. For my main purpose os listening to podcast and audiobooks, the earphones meet my expectations. Sound quality is decent, pairing is quick. The built to me is simple yet high quality. I would recommend this product to my friends.

Customer service is great. The package somehow didn't contain the earcubs, but the issue was promptly addressed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
One died but they made it right.,"I loved these while they worked. I dropped them in water accidently and was thinking I'd be fine because of the IPX8 waterproof... Alas, the right one works but the left one is dead. =( Purchased Mar 18, 2019. Left one declared dead on June 7,2019.

Update
I registered the warranty and contacted the email address on the website. They didn't speak english natively but understood the issue. They kindly requested a picture and explanation of the issue. After sending they offered to replace the broken earbud. I like that they offered to replace the part rather than the whole thing. I hate wasting things. I'll update on how the new earbud works and change my rating accordingly. =)

Update again...
I received a full replacement rather than the defective part... They sound great! However, they are the wrong color. I'm not sure if I'm also getting a replacement earbud for the black set. I'm giving a star bump for the fantastic customer service attempt. Going from 2/5 to 3/5. I was waiting eagerly for the replacement defective part. I received a full replacement but in the color that I don't like.

Yet another update...
They sent me replacement ones in the color I wanted with fast shipping! They work great! While waiting I received the previously mentioned replacement left headphone. I'm not sure how that happened it might be because of a different department issuing that? Regardless the replacement left earbud they sent did not work. Probably because there's some ID or something connecting the two matching pairs. The replacement one must not have been paired to the original.

In short, it's been a lot of e-mails back and forth but in the end, I'm happy. :-) five star customer support!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent sound quality, but other issues...","Sound Quality is awesome, but I'm perturbed at the time I spent emailing the company's customer service and trying to get this thing to connect. It paired easily, but took some time to connect to my iPhone xr. I'm awaiting a response now from customer service regarding volume increase/decrease and back/forward skip tracks. There isn't anything mentioned in the instructions about this. If the device does this the company needs to make that known so we're not asking questions about it. Further, I told them twice to make a YouTube video on pairing/connecting. Mine paired easily, but did not connect to iPhone easily. This company is not considerate of our time. I'm spending too much time with this product emailing back and forth. I'm a busy person and don't have time for this. It needs to be prevented and all this should be easy peasy. I will change my review if necessary, but right now overall I'm not too happy with this product mainly because it's costing me too much time.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound is Amazing!,"I've been trying to replace my old earphones (true wireless) for the past couple of months. I've been researching, reading specifications and reviews of earphones including this one. My ""deal breaker"" requirements were: 1) Sound quality for music and audiobook and podcast, 2) Phone call quality, and 3) The ability to use only one ear phone at a time (either right side or left side). I picked TOZO 10 (I've been using it for the last 2 weeks) because it checked all three requirements and then some. I'm happy with my purchase and the quality of the product. The sounds is AMAZING, the phone call is laud and clear; they can hear my voice clearly and I can hear them loud and clear. The capability of the charging box being charged wirelessly is a plus. The only things I wish were better, are the battery life and the distance it operates away from the phone. it starts to break up if I walk away from my office to the kitchen at work. my old one worked perfectly. Other than that, TOZO 10 is a great earphone.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice job!,"Performed as advertised. First pair of wireless ear buds and I think I scored with these. Just went on a couple of hikes and they worked very well. I had to change the medium ear bud size to the large, but after that I was good to go. Simple to use, comfortable and good sound. I usually have around the ear, noise cancellation,  Bose for work so I am used to quality. These are quite good, especially for just $49! These are great for outdoors, waterproof, you can take one out if you need to be more aware of your surroundings, sweating is no big deal vs conventional headphones, easy to stick in your pocket etc. Good job TOZO!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best Inexpensive Ear Buds in Market,"I rarely leave reviews but for $50? Best damn ear buds I've ever used. I haven't had the need to root my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 since I got the phone — one of the only reasons I would have was if the sound quality was poor. But it's not, it's fantastic. The right-channel ear bud will always lose battery faster because it's the one connected to the phone and the other ear bud at the same time. Your phone is sending the signal to the right-channel which then syncs with the left channel and thus stereo sound. In this process, it has to use more battery life. So get over it people. But I will say that 1.5 hours, give or take, is a long time to have ear buds in at a volume that is detrimental to your health so at 50%, it lasts closer to 2.5 hours.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Work great, bit bulky","I've been using these headphones for about 2 weeks now and think they are great. The main reason I chose these was for the IPX8 waterproofing, and the case that holds them has a lid. Sound quality is very good for an in-ear model. My only complaints are the earbuds are a bit bulky in your ears (but I have small ears) and the range of the Bluetooth could be improved a bit as well. If your phone is in your pocket you won't notice any issues with Bluetooth range, but if you leave the phone out you will notice the range cuts out after about 10-15 feet.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones for exercise or working around the house,"I was a little skeptical of this product before buying it because I had never heard of Tozo before, but I'm glad I took a chance on it. I recently lost my previous set of bluetooth headphones that I didn't really care for that much because they were attached and therefore pulled on my ears. I no longer have that problem and they last longer than my last pair did as well. I really like the charge/storage case, it's very handy. I exercise at lunch so now I can continue listening to podcasts even while changing clothes without my headphones being ripped off my head. They're also really handy for when you're working around the house since I'm constantly moving all over the place. I can comfortably wear them for several hours.

The sound quality when listening to music is great however when I am on a call, the other person/people on the line hear me as if I am far away, and I cut in/out. I believe the issue is whenever there is background noise (fan blowing/AC blowing in the car) it interferes and causes issues. I tried pairing them to another phone but the problem persisted.

After maybe the third time the left ear buds stop syncing, now it won't power up. I contacted the company and they were very happy to help with the situation. I love these earbuds because of the noise cancellation and quality of sound so I am thrilled that I don't have to buy another pair.
UPDATE: My second pair was sent out to me by the company and now it is October and again the new pair stopped syncing. I would not recommend to others and I won't buy again!!!!!!!!!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well crafted easy to use,"Awesome product. When purchasing, I didn't even realize that they would work so well as noise cancellers too. They product feels well crafted and I am confident in it's durability. The instructions to connect it via Bluetooth are also very simple and I have been able to connect it to all by devices seamlessly.

I also used them to workout and even though there was sweat, the earbuds didn't come off. I have yet to use them for a phone call but will update when I do.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones for workout!,"I purchased these headphones a month ago because the wired Blue Tooth headphones were breaking on me.  I have enjoyed these headphones.  They pair right away and I haven't had any issues when I walk around the gym and leave my phone in one spot.  It is nice not having the cord, while you are running or lifting, getting in the way.  Sound quality is very good.  The only draw back is you cannot change the volume on the ear piece, however this doesn't bother me as I usually have my phone near if i want to change the volume.  Overall I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good workout set of headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Whoa,"These little guys completely exceeded my expectations sound-wise, and I’m pretty amazed at how secure they feel in my ear holes. We’ll see how the battery life is - my old buds barely made it an hour. Recommend getting the white ones if you’re plotting beach use because the sun is hot and black absorbs heat. #physicskehd ;)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding for the money,"I’ve gotten tired of my older Bluetooth earbuds as they are still wired together. AirPods are ridiculously expensive, so I Decided to try these after seeing so many positive reviews for 1/3 the price.
Pros- The sound is very good. Not quite 5 star, the bass is t up to what my LGs are, but still very clear and more than adequate.
Battery life is better than advertised. I used just one at a time while at work, and just one side was used for about 5 hours, and still wasn’t dead.
As stated above, for $50 I think it’s a great deal.
Cons- about the only real con I’ve seen is not so much a con as an opinion, and that’s they they’re a bit large for me. Not the silicone inserts, as they include 4 different sizes to find your fit, but the whole earbud itself. But again, at this price point, it’s not that big a deal.
Overall a good buy and seems to be a great product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Mostly great product,"I really liked the ease of connection. The earbuds worked great except for one issue. The left earbud would cut out when i was outside, only for a second, but long enough to be distracting. I replaced the earbuds thinking it was just a bad pair, but it happened with the second pair.
I really wanted them to work, the ease of use and setup was awesome and everything else worked as advertised, but i use them mostly outdoors so this was to annoying to ignore.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible for the price (update not so good),"I got these for working out. They are comfortable and have multiple earbud sizes which is nice. I also sweat a lot, and these stay in and have thus far been effectively waterproof as far as I can tell. For the price, sound quality is great too. Wireless charging a nice plus as well!

Update:
After about a month of owning these they cut in and out constantly when outside. They still work fine inside. Maybe I got a bad pair? I got them for running outside so they are now pretty pointless for me.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are not falling out,"I've had these for about 3 weeks now and can definitely say that these puppies are staying in your ear and they are not budging. They come with an assortment of sizes to fit your ear which is nice. I've moved all around the house, chasing an infant with these in, and they've stayed in place. The case holds up to 4 charges and off of 1 charge, i've been able to watch almost a full-length movie...about 2 hours on one go. Pairing is super simple. I literally just popped them out of the case paired the one, and they were good to go. I haven't had any issues with sound quality or connectivity either.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the gym,"I received the blue tooth ear buds last week and just returned from the gym where I was able to listen to audio book while walking the track , I was also able to continue using while in the dry sauna for ~ 30 min. They fit perfectly and the sound quality is amazing.  The compact case is solid, I am very pleased with the purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I absolutely love these headphones!,"I absolutely love these headphones! They stay in while I'm running and are wonderful for using in the shower! My first pair stopped charging after a few months of use, but when I contacted the company to ask if there was a way I could fix them, they sent me a new set for free! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for wireless headphones that stay in during exercise.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound better than expected.,"Just got them real easy to pair to phone. The sound quality was much better than expected for the size. Charged the carrying case. I had to change the earbuds to smaller sized. Came with four different size buds. Never had a pair of wireless earbuds before. So far impressed with them
Great price. Can't wait to try out at the gym",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Surprisingly clear, large sound stage","First off. The sound is amazing!
Battery life is decent.. And the wireless charging makes them really convenient.

There's a decent selection of rubber ear pieces.
My ear seems to be a strange shape and has a hard time holding them in. Your mileage may vary.
All in all I would buy this again.

Will update after I've put them through their paces here on the farm.
Plus that you can just use the right earbud if you only need one. It complains for a few moments and then stops searching for the second earbud.
Well thought out design.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound and function!,"I knew going into this that I was not spending $150 or $200 for earbuds but having used the Apple AirPods I have to say that this has amazing sound for music and audiobooks/radio streaming.  Amazon HD tracks sound wonderful with great highs and respectable base.  Volume is louder than would ever be needed.  The seal blocks out a HUGE amount of sound and while they don't have ANR they almost feel like they do.  In fact, they are so sound-isolating that I found myself taking one out from time to time to be able to better hear the world around me.

They paired instantly out of the box on my Note 10 and stayed synced.  There are super stable in the ears and I don't see them falling out short of really trying hard to make that happen.  The single button on both the R and L pods work as they should.

Build quality seems top-notch - Apple or Bose quality - for both the pods and the charging case.  The case charges by cable AND wirelessly which is super nice.  It is much larger than the AirPod case so if you are looking for the smallest package possible that is something to think about.

On calls, the voice of the other party is loud and clear but my voice is a bit softer than I would prefer - clearly softer than when using the phone handset mic on speakerphone.  It is too early to tell if this will be a 'problem' or if the other party will just be able to turn up their volume to adjust for it.  My voice is clear, however.

All in all, I can't see paying $150++ for other pods and I am eager to see how these compare with the soon to be released Echo pods.  They set a high bar so for Amazon to ask $90 more they will have to be amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing!,"I was skeptical about this product, but it has exceeded my expectations in every way. Sound quality is marvelous but they must be positioned properly in the ear to get the best quality, particularly in the bass. You can charge the case while listeneing to the earbuds, then put them in the case where they will be charged. I've not tryed the charging pad (purchasing one today). The important thing to remember is to use the earcaps which fit and place them in your ear solidly and carefully using a twist. I had problems with one falling out until I got this down. No problem now. One of the most satisfying experiences I've had with electronics such as this.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, bad battery life","I tested a number of these bluetooth ear buds in this price range and these had the best sound quality with good base. The ear bud fit is ok, they tend to come slightly loose after a while which then affects the base and the sound quality... Bluetooth range is not as good as the other ones i tested. Battery life of the ear buds is ok, but the battery life of the charging doc is rubbish!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No real on ear controls.  Overall not great for much.,"So these have pretty good sound, how ever the controls are kind of garbage.  You can only make a phone call or deny one.  You cant adjust volume, skips songs or anything else.  So even though they are marketed as an athletic earbud they are kind of usless for that.  Also if you do use them to make a call the sound quality of the microphone is exceptionally poor.  These are really only good for listening to music with your device in your hands, otherwise it's pretty annoying to keep getting it out and putting it back constantly when trying to do any type of exercise.  Also they do stay in the ear really well.  They also seem slow to connect to bluetooth and I often have do it manually because I get tired of waiting.  Also you cant use them independently, the left can't connect with out the right and the right beeps nonstop with out the left.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound,"The sound quality is good. Appreciate that I can use one at a time.  The only down side is that they have about a 3 hour life before needing to be charged again, but charging is very quick.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great choice!!,"I purchased the T10 earbuds a while ago.  I have small ears, so I often have difficulty with fit.  These come with several size options so you can get your perfect fit.  The sound quality is great!  While there is a ""left"" and a ""right"" earbud, they are interchangeable.  You can use them both or use them individually.  I have slept with them in and they're still in place in the morning.  They have great customer support to boot.
 You can't go wrong with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"If you want wireless earbuds, get these!","I wanted wireless earbuds cause I keep breaking my regular earbuds. And these earbuds are the best! I have never had a problem with them, they work well, and have a long battery life with the charging case. Any time someone says they want to get airpods I tell them that these earbuds are the better way to go. They are amazing and $100 cheaper than airpods. Also, amazing customer service so if you ever have any problems they can help you. Honestly, the best earbuds I have ever purchased!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Fit and Great Sound Quality,"I ordered this product because my husband researched online and saw the best reviews and the price for these earbuds were not expensive, but of great value and quality. Once I used his earbuds after they were ordered, and I tested the sound using a cellphone, a smartwatch, and a portable bluetooth radio, and found the audio and media sound to be just what I wanted, I purchased a pair also. The charge holds great and we were able to wear these while working out on a treadmill, cooking, walking, or just about anything. They are lightweight but give a hefty sound. I would recommend purchase. I am 100 percent satisfied. But do not believe that you will receive a free wireless charger if you say that you are 100 percent satisfied with these earbuds. Trust me. That's not true.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Shower with them because you can🤷🏿‍♀️,"Without music. These cancel sound decently but with music, don't have your back turned if you scare easily. These mute the world. And that's exactly what I needed. Plus I can wear them in the shower and get extra coursework done that I couldn't do before. Love them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pleasantly surprised,"After going through a number of wireless headphones, and hating all of them, I was pleasantly surprised when I went for my first run with these. The right one popped out on me during a jog but I believe that was due to heavy perspiration. I think a bit of silicone or rubber around the edge that sits in the shell of your ear would help keep this from happening. The sound qualities decent but a bit loud even on level one because of how far down it sits in the canal. But overall this product is great. The charging system is compact and handy. I also love that these are waterproofed. Finally, the price tag can't be beat.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality waterproof headphones at a great price!,"I purchased these wireless headphones for my husband. He is very active & works out almost every day. He wanted something that would be comfortable, sound good, and be waterproof. We were VERY impressed with the quality, sound, and comfort. They stay in your ear really well! The noise canceling is incredible! Even without any music on you can barely hear the person next to you talking! Also really like the charging case, and it’s great for travel. Would definitely recommend this product!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

You get what you pay for,I bought the black set  and a white one for my wife. Battery only last a few hours on them. When used for a phone call there is a huge delay in the voice. When connected to my laptop watching like something on YouTube the lips move and then the sound catches up. More delay on both sets.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I'm very happy with these earbuds,"Everything they claim on their Amazon page is accurate and true.  I tried several other pairs of bluetooth earbuds.  These were the last pair I was going to try before making the jump to Samsung earbuds that cost $130, but I actually like these more.  Although they don't have noise cancellation,  the sound quality is really good and they'll turn up loud.  Plenty loud enough to mow the lawn and still hear every note of the music you're listening to.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Randomly stop working,The product itself is great when it actually works. I bought these for myself and my boyfriend and we have both had problems within the first few weeks of using them. They randomly stop working even though they are fully charged and they always fall out when running. They also randomly connect to your phone when you aren’t using them. Probably not worth the buy,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They’re ok but what do I know I’m just some guy,"I bought them to replace ones I lost. So I’ll just use them as reference.

Here’s what I think:

Good:
-They’re loud
-you can do mono audio (which means you can charge one and use the other to make the battery last longer)
-you can take your shirt off and they won’t come out (no guarantee)

Bad:
-Takes about 10-15s to connect (my other ones connected immediately)
-The case is kind of bulky considering the headphones are so small.
-Phone calls are bad

Battery: constant playing drains about
25-30% per hr",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Simply WOW!!!  Watch out Apple.,"I am absolutely amazed with my new T10s.  I've had LG HBS headsets for over four years because the true wireless devices were of cheap quality in manufacturing and sound in the past.  After bad experiences with my LGs I took a chance and researched the best TWS earbuds to date.  Tozo T10 was the model that stood out!  I received it in less time than advertised.  First impression was positive.  Quality packaging, instructions, feel and sound.  Pairing was very simple.  While playing music from my contemporary jazz library I could hear all the notes from all instruments clearly.  The sound wasn't overbearing and the bass was on target too.  One of the selling points was the wireless charging case.  Keep up the good work.  You are very competitive to Apple's Airpods in price and quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cuts out constantly,Headset cuts out constantly if phone is in my pocket while walking. I have to hold the phone in my hand for it to work which makes this worse than wired headphones. Total garbage and the reviews are obviously fake.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent quality earbuds for this price range,"I was extremely impressed by sound quality of these earbuds. They’re quite loud and provide clear sound. Have very little bass but that’s expected, not a very big deal for me. The reason for my three star review is that the mic quality is EXTREMELY poor. You can hear the person quite clear on the earbuds but they cannot hear you. It sounds as if you were far away and there is static in the background. This is also expected for this price range, but since this is a huge component for me I’ll have to return them. If you’ll be using these strictly for music then they are totally worth it. Another reason for my three stars is because these earbuds were way too big. They do come 4 ear caps but not even the smallest sized fit. They are very easy to pair and you can use one earbud at a time. The downside is that once you start using only one earbud is that you’ll hear a beeping but eventually stops.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Do not stay in ear during active workouts.,"I was excited to read all the glowing reviews of this product. The market is definitely flooded with wireless earbuds and I thought I made a good choice with the Tozo T10. While the sound quality is decent and I liked that I could wear 1 earbud at a time if needed, I was extremely disappointed that the fit was so poor. The earbuds are advertised as great for using while exercising. I beg to differ. I tried all the silicone ear caps and selected the best one for fitting in my ear. I rotated the headset back as indicated in the directions, but I still find they come loose during active workouts. (Not bad if just riding bike, but awful when kickboxing or during any other ""highly active"" sport.) My two star rating is because these earbuds are pretty useless if they don't stay in the ear. I will be returning them and will continue my search for a budget friendly wearable pair of earbuds.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Product,"So far, I have had no issues with this item. The earbuds paired with each other and my phone very easily and the sound quality seems to be comparable with the mid range corded headphones that I normally use while exercising. I did have to change the earbuds for one of the included smaller sizes to fit well but this was not an overwhelming issue. I have, to date, not had the opportunity to test this product with an actual telephone call since I normally utilize them early in the morning just for exercising.

The headphones fit into the case which appears to be able to utilize either a cord or wireless charger. I also appreciate the excellent manufacturer followup, contacting me to insure that I was satisfied with the product.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Great for gym, not a headset replacement","For the $ the sound quality is very good. I get these wet all the time and they do just fine. The software is simple. Bluetooth connection with my android phone is seamless. Put them in ears and go. The mic is not good for phone calls. Most people tell me I sound far away. If you're on a bluetooth headset for work all day, this will not be a suitable replacement. I wish I could find some earbuds just like this with a great mic",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound but not when breaking a sweat,"I wanted a set of wireless ear buds to use at the gym and while running. The sound quality is great on these but no matter what I do and how many different ear bud sizes I try these keep falling out of my ears when I'm sweating, which sort of defeats their whole purpose for me.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, great bass, reasonable price","Edit:  After using a few times, I am happy with the quality of sound.  There are a few glitches that happen though.  If the source of music is not very near the master earbud, ie the right side, it will cut out at times.  It doesn't cut out for long, but is annoying.  I moved my phone from my left front pocket to my right front pocket and this seemed to disappear.
The left earbud will cut out after about an hours worth of use.  Don't know if the battery is getting low to the point where it will periodically disconnect from the right, again, is just a moment lost, but also annoying.  Other than that, I have no real complaints.

To start out, I never pay attention to the 5 star reviews or the 1 star reviews.  These reviews are either by someone who seems to have been paid off to give a good review, or someone who is expecting ""gold"" for the price of ""plastic"".  I find these reviews unbelievable, so I go to the 4 and 3 star reviews for honest reviews.
So the seller is wanting an honest review of the earbuds.  I have used them for about a total of 10 minutes so far, enough to get the bluetooth connected to my phone and hear what they sound like.
The sound is clear with good bass.  How long will the battery last?  I have no idea.  How comfortable are they?  Well in the first 10 minutes, they didn't really bother me, but will find out when I have the opportunity to wear them for an extended period of time.  I also have not had the opportunity to use them on a phone call, so I can't tell you how they will sound, not to me, but the other person on the line.
The case is nice, and wireless charging capability built into the case is good.  The buds are secure in the case, they don't seem to bounce out of the seated, charging position.  All in all, they seem to be a good set of earbuds.  Price is very reasonable.  I hope they will serve me well for at least 1 year, as that would be a good lifespan for any earbud of this style.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bang for your buck!,Loved the TOZO T10 Headphones! Sound is amazing and noise cancellation is great. However it seems to fall out of my ears no matter which size ear cushions I use. Would recommend for heavy sweaters. Also wish there were touch controls. Really sucks when I have to pull out my phone when I’m training to change the volume or skip songs. Besides that the battery life is pretty good and charging is quick. For the price I think it’s worth it!,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones for a great price!,"After having my Bose soundsport stop working I wanted to find a new pair of wireless headphones that wouldn’t break the bank and stumbled across the TOZO T10’s.

"Quality sound, easy pairing","I decided to try the TOZO T10 earbuds after bad experiences with two sets of ""i-something"" buds. The sound quality is good, they fit comfortably in my ears well thanks to the various size of ear caps included. They fit snugly without falling out during moderate movement, such as walking. If I were going to use in a workout situation, I would probably go for a model that has some kind of behind ear hooks. I like the waterproof case; there is a slight magnetism that draws the buds into charging position. There is a USB port for wired charging and it also supports wireless charging. I use with my existing wireless charger for my Samsung Galaxy phone where they reach full charge in a couple of hours. The charge lasts for at least 3 hours of listening to music.

The T10 earbuds may lack the ""cool"" look of the i-something buds. I wear them to listen to music and e-books at the pool. They are a bit large, so if you have smallish ears, they may not be for you.  Other than that, if you're looking for earbuds that fit well and work well, then these may be worth a try!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality at a reasonable price,"I love the wireless Bluetooth earbuds for when I exercise. With wired earbuds, I was constantly getting the wire hung up on something and jerking the earbuds out of my ears, or worse yet, pulling my iPhone out of my pocket. The sound is excellent.

Made me a Bluetooth Believer for Long-Distance Running,"I'm an avid runner and spend a lot of time training on a treadmill. Until Tozo, I didn't think it was possible that a Bluetooth set of earbuds could survive the amount of sweat I produce over an hour or two of an intense workout. What's more, these buds have incredible battery life - so I can take in podcasts, long playlists, and binge-watching while I put on the miles. Comfortable to wear and they never fall out. The sound quality is excellent, and the charging station is super convenient. FInally the price: this is an unbelievable value compared to bigger brands like Apple, and the form factor is less noticeable and frankly more ergonomic on the ear canal.

"Great headphones, especially for the price!","Overall, these headphones are great. I’ve been looking for a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones for while now and I stumbled across these on Amazon and I’m very happy I bought them!

Sound quality is great! Love the bass, as I listen to a lot of hip-hop/rap and edm when I’m working out (which is when I mainly use these). They have a lot of sound power to them and can very loud, so I keep them at maybe 30-40% volume AT MOST and that’s perfect! Practically noise cancelling, as I must take them out to have a conversation and can barely hear anybody around me during my workouts.

They pair very easily and the charging case is great.

There are two downsides, however, and that’s that there’s no ability to skip/backtrack songs nor adjust the volume, which is why I rated 4 stars and not 5. If these features were available, I’d rate 5 stars all the way!

Overall though, great pair of headphones and you can’t beat $50 with free shipping. Especially when compared to the Apple Air Pods, which will run you $160 for practically the same thing.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wouldn't keep these if they were free,"I bought these to listen to while working, as the wired headphones always get in the way and never stay put.

As for these, If the connected device moves at all, the sound is constantly cutting out. It's annoying to the point that I would rather listen to nothing.

They work fine if I'm just sitting at my desk not moving, but then you will barely get two hours out of the battery.

Once the battery gets low, you are done listening because there is a non-stop voice in your ear telling you that the battery is low. It would make much more sense if you simply got one warning and then you get to listen until they die completely.

I have lost trust in brands that Amazon puts it's trust in. I have been ripped off twice in the last month. I guess it's time to start putting in the research before purchasing anything on this site because Amazon's rating system is broken.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Who's ears do these even fit?,"I really wanted these to be the ones that worked since they didn't have a cord, but they were not at all good. I thought maybe changing the earbud tips they provide would make a difference but they don't. They just dangle in my ear, about to fall out and the sound sounds as though the earbud isn't in all the way. Then when I push the earbud in further, it is a larger part of the earbud that finally makes contact with my ear enough to hold it in. I just don't think that the part that holds the earbud in my ear is the part that is suppose to. So after having the earbuds in my ear where I think they should be so they don't fall out, I can't have them in longer than 30 to 45 minutes because they hurt my ear.
Then the button on the earbud is not as easy to push as it should be so when you need to push it, you do so pretty hard which hurts your ear even more.
The pairing and playback was actually pretty good. I wanted to use these between my phone and desktop at work and they worked how I thought they would. I get up to use the restroom and they unpair but when I come back they automatically pair with both devices. Switching from one device to the other is pretty decent also but listening to video messages in Marco Polo still had the skipping in the audio which really bothers me.
So I returned these and found a pair of cheaper $20.95 bluetooth headphones with a wire and an around the ear type of earbud thinking that I'll just use them for working out but they are the best pair that I've found yet! They feel great in my ear, I don't notice the piece that wraps around me ear, they pair so easily with 2 devices at the same time, switching between the devices is seamless, the audio in the marco polo app is perfect with no skipping or pops. I would've paid $60 for a pair like these easily!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WIRELESS,I really love the fact I don't have to worry about the Tozo wireless ear buds getting ripped out of my ears because of a wire. I love how comfortable they feel inside the ear and the sound beats all other ear buds and head phones I've tried. The charging case will also help you from losing them. Pairing was really simple and easy to do. What a great product.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

These are very intuitive to use. They include a variety of earbuds so you can find the right size for your ears. That's very important because with the right fit, these earbuds sound great.

Fantastic Headphones! Five Stars!,My boyfriend and I originally got them so we can listen to podcasts together on walks. The earphones have amazing sound quality. Even if the earphones just in one ear we both can hear the music/podcast perfectly. We run and walk with the earbuds staying in our ears the whole time. Highly recommend the earbuds!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great base. Nice sound.,"The beeping sound that goes off every few minutes from the earbud trying to connect to the other earbud when I only pull out one to use by itself goes away after about a minute. Its alot louder than the FocusPower F-10? FocusPower 10. It Definitely has the word Focus Power in it(the one that comes with a single earbud).

  It's pretty comfortable. Although I've only had it for a few days. Will update later on.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality for the price!,"These T10s are the best wireless earbuds I have purchased. They are light weight and store easily in the charging case. I have charged them wirelessly which is so convenient these days. So happy that I dont have to lug around chargers and cables.

I am amazed at the awesome sound quality! T10’s have great bass. I am using the T10s exclusively now. They stay in my ears and I can workout at gym and run without being annoyed by wires. An added plus is that the T10s are water proof. Sweat is not a problem.

Call quality is clear and noise reduction works so well that I am not disturbed by the people/ environment around me. I highly recommend the T10s!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Garbage!,Absolutely terrible. The sound was bad but the microphone was complete garbage. Person on the other line couldn't understand word I said through these.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Could have been a whole lot better !,"I’ll admit I’m fairly new to these models of Bluetooth earbuds. I’ve owned a number of models that had wires stemming from neckband or around the back of your head connections. As far as sound quality they’re not too bad. I’m assuming there are much better out there. My main issues (unresolved ) are connectivity. Typically not difficult to get to connect to a device but keeping the connection is more challenging. They seem to have good range as I’ve walked at least 20’ from my phone however they tend to cut out side to side randomly with the phone right in front of me. I road cycle and having the phone in my back jersey pocket has always been ideal. Connection however seems to be impossible for these buds from the small of my back to my ears. Very frustrating. I sent one pair back right away and Amazon was solid in sending out a replacement. Sadly, I’m beyond the point where I can return these or I certainly would. I can’t recommend these",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Garbage. 3 months dead,"So have had these now for approximately 3 months.  And they are beginning to not work the right one will no longer charge.  Customer service is not being helpful.  So I no longer recommend these.  It's a shame that good quality is so difficult to find these days.  I assure you I did not abuse them either.  I'm poor I don't abuse my gear.

Waterproof! A little trouble in switching from one ear bud to the other, but that's the only issue.  The charging case is awesome!!! They stay in my ears!  Wish they gave me more control of song playback, but hey great sound quality!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Quality and Price,"These headphones are the absolute best I've purchased.  At $50, they are comparable to any name brand product at 4 or 5 times the cost.

Noise cancelling is non existent on other air pods while these work great to block out noise on the plane without having to turn them full blast.  I ordered a second set for my girlfriend - Highly recommend and super easy to pair!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbuds!!!,"The earbuds are great, light weight, and an easy setup. I mainly use them to watch/stream videos on my iPad. Since I do not run or lift weights … I’m not sure how well they are for working out. The reason I bought them is because my friend recommended them to me.

My only gripe is that the battery life lasted longer than three hours while in use.  I take frequent flying trips and sometimes don’t have time to charge them while always on the go.

Bottom line … they are great earbuds and would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bang-for-your-buck headphones I've found,"I was looking for a solid pair of cheap, waterproof headphones for running and got these on a whim after going through several pairs of from other brands that would consistently break after a month. I've had these for about 3 and have not noticed any issues after using them most of the day almost every day. I wouldn't call them ideal for running since they start falling out once I get sweaty (although I still use them for this, just a minor annoyance) but for non-active use they are amazing. They sound great and have never died on me and all I have to do is charge them every few days or so. I will say it appears that they need a pretty clear line of site to whatever they're connected to as they can cut out here and there. Other than that, I don't think you can do much better for the price and would definitely recommend if you aren't willing to invest in a high-end pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Decent product, great customer service!","For the first two months, these headphones were perfect for daily use - Great sound, lasts for a good amount of time, excellent use during commuting to and from the office, and a good backup for when my primary workout headphones run out of battery.

After two months, the bluetooth stopped working...not with my phone, my macbook, nor my PC laptop....

Great audio quality but microphone leaves something to be desired.,"Overall the TOZO T10 bluetooth ear buds work great. After researching and comparing which wirelesss ear buds to buy, I decided with these primarily for the sound quality and comfort. The audio quality surpassed my expectations as I thought most bluetooth headphones audio aren't the best. Battery life of the earbuds is typical but they charge real fast like other reviewers stated on here. Bluetooth 5.0 works great and at work I am able to walk 30 ft away from the phone with cubical walls up. Some issues I experienced is the poor microphone quality. It does not isolate the surrounding noises which makes it impossible for the other person to understand what I am saying which to me was a big important feature to me. Otherwise these headphones are great for listening to music.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

No Song Skip or Volume Control. :(,"FWIW...double tap does NOT skip songs.  In fact, you dont even have that option.

Not good for working out.,"I bought these for working out specifically. While walking they are fine. However they slowly slip a tad when using the elliptical. But when I went running outside however, they both slipped out of my ear one went straight into the water.

That being said, I do not recommend for working out.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice earbuds. great customer service,"I mainly bought this due to it's ability to not break in water, and it's wireless charging capability.  There were good reviews about the sound quality that sealed the deal for me. The sound quality is very good, but like all earbuds the fit has to be good for that to happen.  I had some issues getting the buds to stay in my ear for long periods so that was my gripe about it.  I think if the buds were shaped better, it would fit in the ear more securely.  Also there's a button, but could have been programmed more usefully.  Instead of double-click for re-dial (which I would probably never use).  having it skip forward/backward would be more useful.  I understand this is a preference, but I'm just stating my preference.

 I would rate these a 4.5 and their customer service 5.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good for music, bad for calls.","I loved the sound quality you get from these, it sounds nice and hd for such tiny little things, the design and texture of
these are superb and current to whats good in the top name brand markets, HOWEVER, the mic built in to these little guys are absolute garbage, i suppose its because the design is more water proof and weather for runners and people who
exercise, i for one, just need bluetooth cuz i like to not get my cord stuck and pulled over every little thing.
Sadly the built in mic is what is a no go for me, i spend almost my entire day every day in call, so the mic has to be perfect while the headset or earbuds are also convenient and comfortable, the mic was the one thing that was lacking and i know this due to the complaints i was getting, i was told i sound like im underwater or muffled and very quiet, note that i had everything optimized on my end to sound good so it was the mic itself as the problem.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Top quality without Big price tag,"The earbuds are fantastic. I have pretty big outer ear canals but smaller holes so normal ear buds easily fall out. I tried the different mix and matches of sizes, and once I got used to the feel, they never fell out. To test the fit, I took them on a 45 minute run without them ever falling out.

Low price but very good quality sound,"I have been pleasantly surprised by these earbuds.. despite their lower cost, quality seems very good, as does battery life.

Don't expect high quality for cheap prices,I like that they're easy to pair and connect. I like how small they are and the fact that you have no wires or anything hanging around your neck is great.

Great expensive paper weight if you ever need one,"For sure I thought, “With 12k reviews, it should be GOOD”!  I wasn’t going to sit around and read through every single one of them.  Most reviews were 4 stars.

Ordered a pair about 3-4 months ago.  Pairing it was straight forward and easy, no issues.  Once paired, noticed the left and right kept disconnecting from each other.  At first I thought it could’ve been due to having little to no reception or a bad connection.  So I uninstalled it and reinstalled, same thing.  I checked and verified that the case had charge, I didn’t charge it as the 3 blue LED indicators was lit up to show battery level (¾ way charged).  I thought maybe I needed to charge it (being a china product) so I let it sit plugged in for an hour.  Listened to it after fully charged and …. you guessed it.  Same thing.

I already knew this one was definitely a defect but gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued testing/using it for the next week.  A week goes by, normal daily usage for about 30mins here and there throughout the day (at work and at the gym).  It did work a lot better at work but I had to stay perfectly still or very little to minimal head movement, gym usage was a def. no GO.  I got a hold of Amazon and a replacement was sent out.  Received my replacement, lo and behold, the same problem with the new replacement.  This time, when the replacement came, I made sure both the case and ear buds were fully charged prior to using it.

The frustrating part was when I was using them at the gym till it starts to go fully crazy.  You sit there trying to tamper, disconnect/reconnect (multiple times) and trying to figure out how you can get it to work properly so you can continue your workout... but to no avail, then you have a bright idea as to use the right side by itself just to get some sort of music going while working out.  During this time you're constantly thinking, “hmm, maybe the left side might work now”, you throw the left side back into your ear and then the cycle repeats itself.  Your 1hr workout, turns into a 1hr and 15/30min workout because of this.

It's been about 3-4 weeks now since I have not used it and its been collecting dust on my night stand!  Paper weight basically.  The return window has now closed so I'm stuck with it.  Overall on a positive note though, I do love the fact that these ear buds are capable of wireless bluetooth charging, have great sound and small enough that it won't fall off my ears (compared to airpods)... if only they WORK DAMN IT!!! Thought I found my perfect ear buds, but now, it’s back to using wired ear buds till I find better.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great quality for the price,I've had the earbuds for about a week and I absolutely love it. Fitting is pretty tight and comfortable. I've never had issue with connectivity so far and pairing is easy after first time connection. Sound quality is even better than certain Sennheiser and Sony models I've had before near this price range. (But this is probably highly personal preference dependent.) The advertised battery life is pretty accurate. My only issue for potential improvement is the inability to control volume and skip tracks.

good wireless for workout,"this is my first pair of wireless earbuds, and I did lots of research to finally decide on this one. here are my reasons and review:
1-price is acceptable
2-the design of the earbuds look cool :)
3-confortable to wear and do not fall even when I do HIIT; and it's not too heavy, so it's still comfortable to wear during workout
4-autoconnect once I take the earbuds out of the case, so it's very convenient
5-has warranty & protection plan: I bought a 3-year accident protection plan for the earbuds
6-sound quality is great. I can hear instruments pretty clear.

My ONLY complaint is that the lowest volume of the earbuds is still too loud for me. My ears are relatively sensitive to loud sound; even though the lowest volume from the earbuds is kinda acceptable, but it's optimal for me. Yet with this price, I think overall it's worthy :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Very impressed, exactly as stated in the ad","I had purchased an Apple knockoff before and they work, but started to fall apart, had little audio, and had a limited battery use.  I then researched for quite a bit and settle on the Tozo 10s.  I have been very satisfied with them so far to date.  They have sufficient volume that I can easily listen to them on a plane, and they do a good job of blocking out outside noise, such as the talkative gentleman next to me in the middle seat.  I really like that they instantly synch with themselves when I take them out of the case and then synch with my iphone.

Surprised it works so well.,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these earbuds. My first concern was that they would fall out of my ears. They stay in place and the quality is excellent.

Awesome,"Just amazing I put these through the test I used these at work  I'm in a fab shop where it can get pretty loud and the earphones can still be hear very clearly,I took them for a workout right after and they would not fall out and the battery power is also amazing,I also even  took them for a swim at the lake,will definitely recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Love them!,"I love these headphones. I have only had them for a few hours but the sound quality is great, the look is nice, very intuitive. The charging case is also very cool.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,DO NOT WASTE your money.  Went to use for first time and the one ear bud died with in a couple min despite charging both for over 12 hours so I assumed it was just a defective pair and sent it back to get a replacement.  When I received the replacement I knew something was off when the plastic box wrapping wasn’t even on the box.  But I charged and thought well I will give it a go.

"Best value! Clear sound, great price!","I'm a skeptic when it comes to advertising ""the best"" this or that.
I compared this product to maybe a dozen others, including some ""brand name"" headphones...
The price per feature is a great selling point, and ultimately, the reason I bought these.
Being skeptical, I opened the box to find a quality product. Not ""cheap"" but quality.
Following the instructions, I had these paired with my LG-G8 in a minute, and started listening to my audiobook... My phone asked me to choose Stereo or HD sound... nice that these support either.
The sound is crisp, they stay connected, no dropping...

I use them also to listen to audible books and while listening to The Fellowship of the Ring, I fell asleep and the headphones stayed in! The battery life only lasts like 3-4 hours but I mean these are meant to be used for workouts and taking audible book naps🤷🏻‍♀️ So the battery life is the perfect amount!

Great customer service,"Update: tozo sent me a new pair of earbuds. A+ customer service.

Awesome sound and comfortable,"These wireless ear buds have been beyond wonderful!

Worse earbuds ever,"I work remotely with folks daily and have tested dozens of earbuds over the years.  The pass or fail is very quick.  With this new product, I really wanted them to work, and probably kept them too long.  They drop signal, people can't hear you well, sound quality is poor.  They are bulky compared to other earbuds and frankly ugly.  Its like having a black bolt sticking out of your ear.  I finally text Amazon support late one night so frustrated that they gave me a refund.  I don't know who these folks are that are giving good ratings, but this product is crap.  I took my refund and bought a pair of  Alterola IE800 Bluetooth 5.0, which I've had for two months and have given them a review rating of 4.5.  They are excellent and look good.

Problems with charging solved by customer services,"The product is really good for all it says it will do. However, since I got the earbuds, I have struggled with charging the left  one.

Excellent Sound.  Super Convienent.,"I love the sound quality these earbuds have.  They put out quality sound with good bass tones, as long as you're wearing both earbuds.

Great Ear Buds,I bought these as a replacement for my headset that broke and I was going to buy a new headset but WOW these little earbuds are great.

Perfect AirPod replacement - updated 1 month in.,"I loved my AirPods - but they would not stay in my ears.  The TOZO 10’s are turning out to be fantastic.

Update - 1 month in and still love the Tozo’s - but I have noticed that people have a hard time hearing me on phone calls - or the quality is not always good.

In addition to earbuds, the charging case doesn't provide enough charge and does not provide playing time as advertised.

Excellent quality and price,"Since upgrading my phone, I have been looking for wireless headphones. I was initially worried because I wasn't sure if these would be comfortable or have good sound quality.

Good Product,"These headphones fulfilled my expectations. The fact that they come with three different sizes of covers was really appreciated since that style of headphones doesn’t usually fit me. They came in a charging case which is always nice to keep them in. My biggest complaint about my previous Bluetooth headphones was that they were always being pulled out of my ears when I turned my head. These stay in my ears even when I turn my head.

Good for the moment,"After using these everyday for 2 months I’m disappointed in the longevity of the ear buds. The sound quality is good. I can hear the production very well and distinguish highs/lows. Noise cancellation is great IF you get them all the way in your ears. The ear buds are starting to cut out after only two short months. I haven’t tested them in the water. Battery on lasts 3 hours with constant non-stop (active) use.  Both earbuds have audio at all times, meaning if you take one ear buds out, they both stay on. Great start but needs improvements.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What impressed me most is the wonderful customer service and support!,"I am absolutely shocked at TOZO’s product support and customer service! They are awesome! The first wireless earbuds I bought started to cut out on a regular basis. I didn’t want to return them because the earbuds are light weight and are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I called customer service and the gentleman knew all the fix tricks. He was very knowledgeable about this product. It was refreshing! When he could not get them to stop cutting out, he immediately ordered replacement earbuds. I did ship the defective ones back. The replacement earbuds are just as awesome! I love these earbuds not only for the comfort, but the sound quality is top notch! They really do cut noise out as well!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the cheap cost,"The quality of these headphones is something that is pretty awesome, in that fifty dollars can get you something that will in theory, do the job. But my concern with these headphones was three decent sized problems.
The headphones themselves are not very comfortable. I have average ears. I have not come across many sets of earbuds or headphones that feel awkward or difficult to wear. These earbuds do not feel good though. They also have a huge problem of sliding out, no matter what position I place them. I attempted the different size inserts, and they also had similar effects. This has not been a problem on other brands. I have since switched to the JBL Free X and they fit without any issues and have thus far been extremely comfortable.

The next issue is the quality. The bass seems to sound very distorted in these ear buds, while the left one specifically has a very tinny quality to the highs. It's jarring and forces me to want to turn the volume down, even when listening at low volumes. Overall, the quality of the audio is mixed, which is odd for something that you would think would be similar between both sides.

And last, the drop out. These earbuds do not stay attached across any of my devices for a constant session. Every few minutes, they will have a few seconds of audio loss and then come back. This is not a case of getting notifications. It's interference or just bad quality. I've used these buds on apple and android products, and none of them can keep these things attached without audio loss.

Overall, they aren't worth the money. I understand they are cheap and the technology is still being innovated. But overall, if they sound different from one ear to another, don't fit well and can't play without feeling like your audio is censoring itself, then they simply aren't worth the money invested in them. I would move on to a different product, probably something a bit more reputable.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FINE PRODUCT AT A FINE PRICE POINT!,"This is a fantastic product! I was looking for an ""in-ear' headphone alternative to replace MY customary ""over the ear"" headphones because I wanted something compact. But truth be told I wasn't a fan of anything that went inside the ear because I had found they always fell out! Well I did my YouTube and Amazon review research and I narrowed it down to the Tozo T10. I am a proud Android phone user (Samsung Note 9) and I didn't want anything that looked like those long white stemmed eye sores, so aesthetically, for me, they were perfect! It turns out that they fit beautifully, they sound AMAZING, the battery life is superb and I could not be more satisfied over a purchase as this! I would recommend these headphones to everyone and anyone! Oh by the way, pairing Bluetooth devices for me is very often hit or miss for me but these pods came about 75% charged out of the box and I'VE NEVER seen a faster pairing out of the box!! I literally took one pod out of the case and before I could pull the other one out, within seconds the pod had already paired! It was amazing! And lastly, the price was economical for an item of this quality! Perfection is hard to come by, so if I have one complaint is that replacing the the rubber tips for a better fit, at least for me, was a difficult task! I don't know if I was creating a more complicated scenario but I found that part to be annoying, but I finally accomplished my mission and if that's the worst I can mention, what are you still doing reading this review!? Go put in your order, I think you will be pleasantly pleased, I know was!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Not for swimming, work well for everyday life","Update:

I believe they really care about customer satisfaction and I appreciate that. The headphones work well and paired well with my samsung galaxy s10 plus. They are comfortable to wear but the only downfall is that they do not work underwater. They are waterproof to a short depth but the sound cuts out immediately because of the bluetooth connection. As an everyday pair of headphones I give them a 4 stat as per swimming..  well they did not serve the purpose at all so it will be a 1 star.

I’m addition, the little blue and red lights are constantly flashing during use which makes it annoying for night usage.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome little bluetooth headphones,"These are GREAT little headphones. For years I've owned the bluetooth headphones that have a U shaped bit that goes around your neck, and have always enjoyed them. They stay put and dont weigh a lot, etc.

My last ones broke so after a bit of research, for the money and features, these headphones are awesome. They have 4 full charges in the case itself, the earbuds SOUND great with plenty of bass (find the right fitted ends for the earbuds). I was worried about them falling out of ear but that hasn't been a problem at all! They're very light and stay in there very well, and don't stick out too far.

The only thing I wish these did was allow volume control from the earbuds themselves, you have to control volume from the phone/device. That isn't a huge deal though, I would highly recommend these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

One of your best bets for truly wireless earbuds on Amazon under $50,"A few things I liked about the product -
1) Earbuds: Quite sturdy with a magnetic case. It has suggestive LEDs for pairing notifications, charging notifications. I've already dropped them twice on gravel and concrete, but not a scratch yet. These were very easy to set up, and the usage is pretty intuitive.
2) Sound: These earbuds are definitely bass-heavy, which suits my usage and music taste.
3) Ergonomics: They fit snugly in my ear, after switching tips. The buttons on the earbuds could have been a bit more tactile; they do feel plasticky and cheap. No complaints though, for this price-point.
4) Case support for wireless charging: Something that even a lot of high-end earbuds lack.

All in all, for lay music purposes, these earbuds do more than enough justice to punch way above its weight. I would highly recommend getting these. Total bang for the buck.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"for $50, cant beat it.","once I realized I was putting them in my ears upside down, they sound excellent when worn properly! Paired quickly and good range with bluetooth 5.0.

Amazing Earbuds,These earbuds are really nice. They really are noise cancelling and they have so much bass.  They have different sized rubber tips for comfort and boy are these comfortable. These have been in my ear almost nonstop since I have gotten them. I love them. I think the only time I removed them was to charge them. I also love the fact that they are water proof.

Great Headphone have bought twice,"I bought these headphones before I went on a trip to Aruba.  It was my first pair that didn't have a cord.  I was skeptical at first but they were VERY comfortable.  So comfortable in fact, that when a strong gust of wind blew-it flew out of my ear.  I didnt realize at first (since they feel like nothing) but when I did realize it was too late and they had gotten run over by a car.
I was sad- I didn't want to pay $50 for a new pair so I went with a cheaper pair from a different brand.  Let me tell you-saving $15 was NOT worth it.
I tried to wear the other pair I bought and they were awful.  So less than a week later I rebought the pair and haven't looked back.
They ate a great set of headphones and I would recommend to anyone",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Will recommend to a friend.,"For the price I pay for this product exceeded my expectation.  The earbuds is very easy to connect to my device.

Not for exercising!,"As a runner, cyclist, gym-goer, and walker, I wanted non-wired bluetooth earbuds that would allow me to listen to music on the go (as opposed to making phone calls). In that regard, the Tozo T10-R's are pretty much the worst possible option.  Let's start with the fact that, no matter which of the different earbud sizes I tried, the earbuds quickly and nearly immediately fell out of my ears, over and over. I finally began coating them with sticky hair gel before every workout (good work around but annoying). Even worse, the earbuds have no controls for music volume or changing songs. So if you are running, or riding your bike, or lifting weights, you have to stop whatever you are doing and fish your phone out of your pocket to make any adjustments. Ridiculous. I regret spending $50 on the Tozo T10's and will eventually ditch them once I save up for some new earbuds.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Earbuds for elephants. Sizes range from too big to bigger. Ouch!  UPDATE!,"Battery life is really short... less than 3 hours. Earbuds are all too big and cause ear canal to start hurting before the short-lived batteries quit. The different sizes of earbuds range from too big to even bigger. They tend to fall out unexpectedly presumably because of the oversized earbuds. Other than these shortcomings the sound is good and so far no problems with showering with them in except for the occasional unexpected pop outs. I’ll update this review in few months to see if they hold up over time.
UPDATE:  Heard from Tozo and they say that they are sending replacement earbuds as well as replacing the units with an updated model which would be great except that it appears they sent them to someone in California.  I told them about the errant addressing problem.  Will update further if the replacements actually get to me.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Who needs the big names!,"I have problems with any earbuds staying in my ears. Now that I have a piercing inside my ear (daith) it makes it even harder to get an earbud to stay in. After some playing and adjusting my earring numerous times. I found with these all I have to do is put it in! It stays put with absolutely no loosening. I wear them when mowing the lawn and I can’t even hear the lawnmower with the volume turned down to 1/4 or lower of their capabilities. I’m typically a volume all the way up blaring out my eardrums kind of person. But with these that is too loud! I can’t believe I just said that! I’m so glad I bought these for a fraction of the cost that I was considering, big name brands around the ear or over the ear styles. If these continue to hold up I’d definitely recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would not buy or recommend.,"The packaging looks great, and it feels like a solid product when you open it. However, I had a lot of issues with these earbuds. The audio sound was great when it actually worked, but I had issues getting a consistent sound. When my phone was in my pocket the sound cut out a lot. Sometimes I would be stopped at a crosswalk and just turn my head and the audio would cut out and be choppy. The only way I was able to get consistent clear audio was when the phone was out directly in front of me on my desk while I was working. I was not satisfied with this device at all. The Bluetooth connection/range is horrible on this device, and not worth the money at all. I'm not sure why these were Amazon's recommend choice.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Still have not received my replacement earbuds,"I love these ear buds.  I did drop them on Sunday, couldn't get them reconnected.  I contacted TOZO let them know what happened.

My Amazing Earbuds!,These TOZO earbuds are amazing! The battery on these earbuds lasts over a week which makes it very convenient. The sound quality is stunning while  in use to make calls or to listen to music. The overall fit of these earbuds is incredible.

Crazy lag and low sound quality,"I bought these because the headphone jack on my laptop is getting a little touchy, and I thought it would be neat to have totally wireless earbuds. These are that, and they have a great fit. Battery is decent for these class of headphones, and the charger is nice. Pairing was easy, and I like that it can pair two devices.

Unfortunately, that's where my good experience ended. The audio lag on these with both computers I tested these on was absolutely awful--about .5-1 second. It was completely unusable for anything other than music due to this lag.

I decided with that in mind I'd take them to work and pair them with my phone to just listen to music while I code. Turns out the sound quality is also fairly bad, somewhat tinny and empty, especially compared to my other $50 wired earbuds. I get that there's a big tradeoff here for wireless, but at this point that tradeoff is just too big for me. I'd rather deal with the wires and even with the slightly loose headphone jack.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent value,"The earbuds case is solid with a translucent hinged top so you can see the charging status lights. They turn on and off easily by removing and returning them to the case and there's a solid click when you return them to the case. The best feature is that they can be recharged wirelessly. I've successfully charged them wirelessly on both my round 'hot plate' and vertical 'easel' style chargers. There's a wired USB micro charging port as well.

The 8mm driver provides very good sound for the price. I'm sure everyone knows the sound quality is dependent on the fit and experimenting with the supplied ear covers is critical; there are several and I easily found the right ones for my ear size. I found them comfortable too. The bass is subtle but overall, the sound is acceptable. I haven't tried using them for phone calls.

Pairing is easy and automatic (after the first time). Remove the ear buds from the case and they pair with other and within seconds they pair with your device. Return them to the case and they disconnect and power down.

There are no controls on these earbuds which I knew when I ordered them. You use your device volume control and application controls. This is fine but I discovered, for me, I like the convenience of a volume level control and pause/play in my earbuds.

So very nice case, good sound, wireless charging, easy pairing, but no controls make this a good choice for the excellent price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
This is the BEST purchase I've made in years.,The ear buds have freed up my ability to listen to audio books while I work and Drive.  They also handle cellphone calls with a built in microphone. The sound quality is perfect. One reviewer mentioned blue light blinking in a dark room - yes that happens so just close your eyes or cover your ear buds.  NOT A PROBLEM. There is a reason that these were an Amazon Prime Favorite... which is one reason I bought them.  Amazon has great quality controls and recommendations.  I would buy these again.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awful usability - Please consider before purchasing,"Usability from just my one case (2-month experience with 3-minute round trip commute 3-5 days/week:
(1) Bluetooth connectivity leaves much to be desired. Expect minutes for completion of successful connectivity (both left and right ear components actually “connected”)
(2) Sighed in mental relief, rather than, OH, NO when one earbud fell into subway tracks
(3) Battery life = subpar @ best compared to competing non-Apple choices (as of 2019)

"Great sound quality, but..","Overall, it's a good product.  One thing that I do not like is the fact that I cannot easily skip songs or answer a call (I'm comparing to my previous LG headset).  The sound is really good, better than my LG model.  The pods are larger than I had expected and they stick out of my ear's quite a bit.  The microphone has some issues that I do not like.  Maybe it's because of the noise cancelling aspect, but it seems like I have to nearly yell to talk on the phone.  I found this quite uncomfortable especially in public area's.  Again, I'm comparing to my LG set, maybe that's how these ear buds are in general.  The privacy aspect and requirement of increased voice to make/answer a call is the main reason for my star rating.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cheap earphones,"I’ve been using for a couple hours, most days since receiving these headphones. The battery life is already extremely diminished. In addition, often times one or both cut out as if they aren’t getting signal anymore. My third issue is that recently one of the buds fell out of my ear while I was sitting and listening to music. Unfortunately the rubber part stayed stuck in my ear and i had to get assistance to remove it from my ear. Not pleased with these to say the least.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Happily Surprised,"Received the TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds for Christmas and so far I have been happily surprised at how great they work.  I like the compact size and charging case. My only compliant is that the bluetooth signal doesn't extend as far as I would like.  I usually use them with my Ipad and if I walk more than 10 feet away they disconnect.  I do really really like how easy they connect to my devices and each other.  I returned another brand I bought because it was such a pain to connect the earbuds to each other!  I could only get one to work at a time. It was so irritating.  With these I just take them out of the case, select them on my device and they simply connect themselves.  They are great pair of earbuds for the price!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprised.,It arrived very nicely packed in its case. Charging very easy. Only have been using it for 3 days but love how it is compact and stored in own case. Sound is just like my over the ear wired ear buds. So far works very well while sweating. May get another pair of all ok after 1 month.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Paired with my AppleWatch make great set-up for mowing, yardwork or the gym","I've had these for about 4 months.  So far they have worked well.  I paired with my Apple Watch and have enjoyed music and podcasts while mowing and at the gym.  Nice not to have to haul the phone everywhere.  They do pretty well for noise cancellation, as I was using them while using a chainsaw.  Haven't submerged them, but they seem to tolerate getting sweaty OK.  They have a decent battery life and charge pretty quickly",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
AFFORDABLE! Awesome quality and great sound!,"I recommend these airbuds, because they are inexpensive and well worth the price. They are extremely easy to pair, not difficult or too techy to understand how to work them. When I wear them at the gym the outside sounds do not bother me, you can hear the music. I use them when I clean my home, when I vacuum I can't even hear the machine. You can change the size of the rubber bud so you shouldn't have a problem fitting your ears. So far this was worth the cost instead of paying $200 for higher AirPods. Great Job!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sound is muddy, bass heavy - wouldn’t stay in ears",Heavy and muddy bass. Highs lack definition. Listened to these for about 2 minute and returned them. Bebens are very similar in sound. Prefer the Kissral Bluetooth headphones. Much better sound. Also I could not get these to stay in my ears while walking no matter what size earbuds covers I used. Disappointed.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Quality product, great sound, amazing support.","These earbuds fit so great. I can’t hardly tell they are in, and aren’t heavy at all. Provide great sound. And I love the case also charges the earbuds. It’s everything I wanted in wireless earbuds. And they don’t look cheap like those apple equivalents. Quality product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So far so good.,Just got my TOZO T10 bluetooth earbuds and so far they are awesome. Very user friendly. Just pop them out of the case wait til the both light up and then connect to Bluetooth and your off. So far they seem to stick in my ears snugly and comfortably. I bought them to listen to music while at the driving range since cords just got too uncomfortable you use and being sweaty the normal earbuds fall out. These work perfectly for what I need them for. Haven’t tested battery life out just yet but 3-3.5 in the buds plus a backup of 9 hrs should be plenty of life for what I need them for.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Highly water resistant.....not waterproof!,"Love these new earbuds with several brands and styles which I have purchased, these are the best all around.  They fill my ear well, have good sound, and adore the water resistant nature of these earbuds.  I have, as noted, many pairs from other mfgs on Amazon.  I work out daily, run, lift, and swim.  As part of that workout, I hit the Steam room, and jacuzzi and easily dunk my head in the pool or jacuzzi without any troubles.  Of course Bluetooth cannot transmit in water, however, as soon as your ears are clear of the water, sound picks right back up.  An important note is that if you drop it in the water to a depth of 3 feet or so...you are likely to have troubles.  The right earbud is the most likely to have troubles it seems after water at depth.  The first pair I dried in salt/rice for a day or so and it was still dead.  Then the second pair, after drying out, has recovered and is working fine.  Get them wet...no Problem, drop them in 3 feet of water for 20 seconds...likely dead.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Performance and Excellent Quality,"The TOZO T10 wireless earbuds design, clarity of sound, Noice cancellation and performance is excellent.

It is suitable for everyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Having issues with these working as a pair. But did get a replacement,"Mine stopped working after 2 days. They would not connect as a pair and only as individual bluetooth devices. I tried all types of resets and then reached out to seller and tried their instructions to no avail.

The seller offered to send me a replacement after placing a review. Awaiting to see what the result is of that.

Edit: The seller sent me a new pair and they do seem to be without issues so far. So I am upping the review.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
YESSSSSSSS. THESE ARE THE ONES.,"THESE. ARE. AMAZING!!!!!!
If you need headphones, please get these. The quality is really quite great. Ease of use is fantastic. Noise cancellation is great. So so excited about these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised that they are magnetically pulled towards the case as you are trying to put them in the case so they just pop right in their spot.  I am getting a pair for my husband as I can already tell we will be fighting over these.  Money well spent!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
would be great if they stayed in my ears!,"These paired well and sound quality was good, but they kept falling out! I switched up the earpieces and it still happened when I was walking around places. Would definitely not recommend for running/intense workouts, but I was a fan of a lot of other things, especially the fact that you could charge the case wirelessly.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Quality for the Price,The earbuds worked this weekend at the pool.  The sound was good and they are easy to pair and control.  I liked the way they fit and that they come with different sized ends for the best comfort.  I will be buy more as gifts come Christmas!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for the price,"Sound is good. Not awesome, not poor. Decent bass, not very high definition. I don't feel any noise canceling different than just the hermetic fit on the ear.
Battery life better than I expected. I usually get tired of wearing them earlier than when the battery dies out.
Light and discrete.
A very importan con: Two ore three days after the purchase, the company e-mailed me asking for a 5 star review and in return they would provide an extra charging base. To me the product is very good for the price, but this is a commercialization approach that should be banned by amazon. It is disrespectful and dishonest. This creates false positives reviews, and in the long term make the costumer not trust in the reviews. Maybe the rates this one have is already untrue and I had bought another brand.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These earbuds are surprisingly good,"I have been testing out many headphones/ear pieces over these past few years commuting to work in the DC/Virginia area. I have about an hour commute each way and usually am listening to an audiobook, or enjoying some music as therapy for the gnarly traffic and the crazy drivers that get your blood pumping.
Bluetooth wireless earpieces are a must now with the audio port gone from the iPhones. My experience has been that connecting up the phones is not always easy. The TOZO T10 ear pieces seem to connect with ease-- only one ear piece needs connection and the other will join in with ease. Good on TOZO.
The real pleasant surprise is when the music comes. Right out of the box, it seems the ear pieces are made for music. There is enough noise dampening to filter out the background noise and you feel like you have been transported to a world where every note can be heard. For driving, the ear pieces are snug enough to ensure the audiobooks can be heard but I can still hear enough traffic around me (in case of emergency vehicles coming).
Looking forward to more time with these ear pieces.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better second experience,"UPDATE: Since I had a serious problem with my initial pair of these earbuds, the manufacturer quickly sent me a replacement set that did not have the battery problem of my first set. In the interim, I acquired a different set of similar earbuds from a different manufacturer. As a result, I have what I didn't have the first time I wrote about these: a basis for comparison. My overall experience is that although I don't own a perfect set of waterproof Bluetooth earbuds, this one is much more reliable.

THE GOOD
- I'm not an audiophile, but the audio quality is much better than any previous headphones I've owned.
- They do a good job of blocking ambient noise.
- The clicky nature of the buttons means you can stick them in your pocket without accidentally setting off the controls.
- Due to the clicky buttons, they're easy to turn on and off.
- Battery is generally decent. The charging case discharges a little faster than I'd like - it went from full to low over the course of a weekend when I used the earbuds very little - but this isn't a big problem since it's easy to charge them.
- They fit in my ear pretty snugly.

THE LESS-GOOD
- Some of the controls are nonsensical. When I'm listening to music, why would I want a double-tap on either headphone to redial the last phone number called? The instructions mostly only cover phone-related activities. There are no instructions for skipping forward and back a song, or for adjusting volume.
- The headphones pair to each other well, but having to manually pair them to my phone every! Single! Time! is very annoying.

THE NEUTRAL:
- From the different pairs of Bluetooth headphones I own, I get the sense that occasional mild interference from nearby devices may just come with the territory.
- Although the instructions aren't ideal, there's some important information there: only pair the right earbud with your phone; never the left. Pairing them both causes weird behavior. Completely deleting the connections and re-pairing them makes the weird behavior stop.

Since I've owned both sets of earbuds, I've switched back and forth testing each set. The last time I knew I'd be away from my house for an extended period of time, the TOZO earbuds are the ones I chose to take with me because they're just more reliable. Overall, this is a fairly decent set of this style of earbud.
-----------------

ORIGINAL REVIEW: My experience with these just went from mixed-but-largely-positive to negative. The set I purchased worked well until they became unusable.

I was lured in by the seemingly overwhelmingly positive reviews., and up until yesterday, I was mostly satisfied with them. The sound quality was good and they did a better-than-average job of blocking ambient noise. The buds usually pair to each other well, but it's annoying that I have to go into the Bluetooth menu on my iPhone to actively pair them every single time I use them. Is this standard for for type of earbud?

I've experienced a little of some of the other complaints I've seen here: I've had a couple of instances of the buds not pairing to one another well in the first few days, but the problem stopped after a few days. I also once experienced the audio cutting in and out when I was around other people, but this did not happen regularly.

The big, dealbreaking problem - and why I'll be returning them - is the battery on the earbuds. I'm in the habit of leaving the charger plugged in most of the time, and putting the earbuds back in the charger when I'm not using them. Yesterday, after I used them for 30 minutes in the morning, I  put them in the charger, which was plugged into USB at my workplace. After eight hours, I took the earbuds out of the charger, started using them, and left work. Within FIVE MINUTES, the right earbud began signaling low battery, and shut itself off after a couple of minutes of warnings. Again, they had been in the charger for a solid eight hours. Neither earbud's ""charging"" light was lit, so I had no reason to believe they didn't have a full charge. The charger itself showed a full charge. I just tried them again - they'd been shut off since - and the right earbud reported low battery after two minutes. I accidentally left the charger at work, so I guess I'll find out on Monday whether this was an aberration, or if the right earbud's capacity for a charge has been permanently reduced to a few minutes.

Let me be clear: I used these earbuds for less than two weeks before this problem, which renders the earbuds useless, occurred.

Although I've read a few reviews here that indicate I'm not the only person who has had this problem, it doesn't appear to be as common as, say, audio cutting out or problems pairing the left earbud. My guess is that this set is defective, but after reading other negative reviews here on Amazon - seemingly buried under a suspicious number of five-star reviews - I'm not going to seek a replacement because it looks too likely it would instead have a different set of the more common problems.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for the price!,"These earbuds have a great sound. Good bass, crisp and clear. They easily pair automatically when you take them out of the charging case. The previous earbuds I had were always a pain to pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Earbuds need to remain within 3 feet of the device.,"Not crazy about these ear buds. They drop connection constantly. You literally have to have both ear buds within 3 feet of the device that's casting the bluetooth signal. Simply turning your head or touching the ear buds with your hand will cause the ear buds to loose connection. When the connection is okay, the sound quality and noise cancellation is awesome. It's just annoying having the keep a direct line of sight and your head really close to the casting device.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"LIBRA FROM MEMPHIS, TN YOU GO TOZO T10!!","I not  only like TOZO T10, I LOVE MY WIRELESS EARBUDS. I  HAVE HAD  A NUMBER OF CO WORKERS TO ASK ABOUT THEM. IT WAS VERY EASY TO PAIR THEM. THEY ALREADY HAD SOME CHARGE TO THEM WHEN I GOT THEM. MY PLANS ARE TO BUT 2 MORE PAIR. THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE MAJOR COMPETITION OUT THERE. WHAT  A GREAT PRODUCT!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Difficult Decision to Return These,"These are really nice Earbuds.  Everything they say is true.  A free 1 year warranty.  The product build is exceptional, as is the packaging in which they are shipped.  And they connected to my I-phone so quickly it was actually a non event. So, it was a very difficult decision when I decided to return them.
I originally purchased and compared two sets of earbuds and this set of earbuds was superior to the other in all categories except one.  The sound.  And it was extremely close even in that category but, in the final analysis, I realized the quality of sound was the most important feature so I eliminated all others from my decision and the OFUSHO earbuds were the winner by a very small margin.  They are also a little less expensive but, again, I did not include that in my final decision.  If, like me, the sound quality of your earbuds is paramount, assuming all other features are acceptable, then choose the OFUSHO.  But, I really believe most people would prefer the exceptional features and quality build of these ear buds.  The quality of sound difference is truly marginal but enough for me to make my decision and the longer battery life is just a perk.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can not wait for an upgraded version.,"I have these earbuds now for about one week. The sound is excellent and the noise cancellation is outstanding. The battery life not so good because it only provides a three hours charge. The price is unbeatable for what you get. Other earbuds battery would last longer but would also cost triple or more and you may not get the same sound that you get with this set. Overall, this is a good buy and I am sure they will find a way to increase the battery life to their upgraded product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best True Wireless Earbuds for Students!,"Where to start... These earbuds blew me away. Though the bass could be somewhat overpowering at times to the point where the lows flood out the highs, the sound on these are incredible for the price point. The build of both the earbuds and the case are phenomenal - no complaints there. The charging case helps so that your earbuds stay 100% all day long. I've been able to take these from my 8AM classes all the way to my workouts at night on ONE CHARGE ALONE. All I can say is that these are a must buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound but some connection issue with left bud.,"The sound quality is great when it works. Every so often, the left side has a connectivity issue and fades in and out (when pairing with phone, its the right side that pairs whule the left side is tethered). The noise cancelling feature works and the earpieces hold tight in ear when inserted correctly.  I'd give 5 stars if the left bud would have a constant connection and not fade in and out.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THESE ARE AMAZING!! ❤️,"I went for a run yesterday after I received these headphones in the mail. So I could test them out.
I absolutely love them!!! They sound and quality was amazing. They stayed in my ears and as I was sweating there were no problems what so ever!
I have an iPhone XS Max and these work perfect with it! I would highly recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love these things!,Decided to give these a try and I am happy I did. These earbuds sound great with incredible bass. The fit in the ear canal is perfect. They are not loose when I am at the gym. I also love how the charging works when you place them in the case and you can either use the attached cord to plug them in or if you have a charging pad you can just place them on top and walk away. For the money you can't beat them in my opinion. Best earbud purchase to date!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So Glad I Purchased These Earbuds!!,"I was nervous about the quality of these earbuds when I decided to buy them because they cost a lot less than the earbuds made by the brands I recognized. I went ahead and made the purchase because I knew I could return them if they weren't what I wanted.  I am so glad I made the decision to try them. I absolutely love them!! The set up was simple and they are very easy to use. I have been using them every day since the day I got them to listen to music and audiobooks and for calls. The sound quality is great.  Noise cancellation works very well. And, they charge very easily. I  highly recommend them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

TOTALLY WOTH IT!,"It's incredible the quality of the product for the price you pay. I have a pair of jaybird run ( that I bougth for over 200$ a year ago), but unfortunately I lost the charging case so I couldn't use them unless I buy the case which was 70$ and out of stock, reason why I decided to look for some earbuds and I decided to give this pair of 50$ a shot. What an amazin idea I had! This pair totally overcome my expectatives and made me really happy with the product in question

After a Month of Use,"After a month of use, I can confidently recommend this product. I wasn’t sure when I was first on the search for a wireless earbud. I found this one and decided to test it for a bit before writing a review on it, just in case it didn’t hold up over time.
I’m glad to say it is a really great product. The sound quality is fantastic and it blocks out most noises while i work out at the gym.
They also stay in my ear when I run, unlike my last pair of earbuds.
I worries whether they would be uncomfortable in my ear, but with the different sized ear pads, I found the right pair that felt comfortable.
The only con I have is the size of the charging case. It’s rather large. Large enough that it doesn’t fit in a pocket comfortably, and looks too odd to carry around.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good headphones,"Overall very good headphones. I have enjoyed these for the first month I have had them. Long battery life and have even been able to shower with them. The microphone has a bit of trouble picking up my loud voice for calls, so I hold one in front of me when someone can't hear. For everything else, five stars.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These earbuds raise the bar,"After researching for months, I bought these when they came up as a deal. I have not been disappointed. The sound is great. I adjusted the sound settings on my phone (Galaxy S7) to simulate a tube amplifier and the bass is great! I've used them for 2-3 hours at a time at moderately high level with no battery life issues. They pair consistently and have decent Bluetooth range. I would definitely buy them again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
General functionality,"First, if you have  more than one device that you have paired with this product, beware. It will constantly try to pair, and tell you it is connected  wih both deices, but it will not work. Once it gets confused, it is an effort to ever get it to re-connect. An aggravating and dangerous task if you are driving. In my case, an Iphone and Ipad in the car together. It simply cannot do this. In addition, the left channel problems are real. Seem to be when the source device is in close proximity, it is as tho the left channel want to pair directly  with the device, rather than the right earphone.  I am returning.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great stationary- not so great active earbuds,"These are wonderful for stationary work, but terrible for walking/active use.

Great Earbuds for A Great Price!,"So I've been trying to find good Bluetooth earbuds for awhile now and I came across these. The earbuds had great reviews and were only $50. To me that is a great price for Bluetooth earbuds. I was completely right. The sound quality is great for $50. They are easy to use and fit perfectly in my ear. I thought that they might fall out but I was wrong. I workout with these all the time and they have never fallen out. The charging case it comes with is also very handy, with a long lasting battery life. Overall I think these are one of the best Bluetooth earbuds you can get for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product Very Satisfied,"I am very impressed with these ear buds, they are light weight and fit in my ear very well and do not fall out. Buds come with several sizes of soft silicone tips to find a great individualized fit. They pair to each other incredibly fast and to my phone very quickly as well. The sound quality is great with good bass and clear treble. I listen to both spoken words with pod casts and music and both come in crisp and clear.
I have not tested the waterproof capability but do not plan to listen while showering or swimming so I am not very concerned with that. The only suggestion I have is to include volume control on the ear bud - controlling this from my phone is no problem though. Great product and I am very satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, fit, and high quality","As a regular bike commuter, who rides in all kinds of weather, I need a comfortable, noise reduction, and high-quality sound earbuds.  These fit the bill wonderfully!  The sound is amazing and makes me feel like I'm sitting in my living room listening to music through sound speakers.  I found I could customize the fit with the supply of ear cushions.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
4.5...but Amazon won't let me put that,"I really like the sound from these earbuds. They're clear with a decent amount of bass. My only complaint is that you can only pause/play music and answer/hang up calls from the earbud itself. My other one I can skip tracks by double pressing the right one and go back by double pressing the left. Other than that they're great for the price. I really like that they have wireless charging...that feature is cool but doesn't really help me when I'm listening to music and want to change the track. I got wireless earbuds for a reason...and unless I'm wearing my watch, I have to get my phone and change tracks..I guess it's a minor inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love these earbuds!,"I love these! I usually have trouble finding earbuds that fit properly because they're too big, but it comes with different sizes so you can adjust it. The sound is great! I no longer need to worry about dropping my phone every few minutes at the gym because these are completely wireless. The sound does cut off sometimes if there are a lot of people at the gym. These are my first bluetooth earbuds and not too expensive. Overall they work great and they don't fall out if they're put on properly, which was a concern I had when looking for what to get. Highly recommended.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They're actually awesome,"At first I was kinda skeptical, I thought you can't get good quality earbuds at a fraction of the price, but I decided to give it a try, considering the good reviews, and I'm glad I did ....
This things are super awesome, and super easy to use, u just pull them out and start listening to music, automatically connects, automatically pairs, they even hold perfectly, like Apple headphones always fall out of my ears, I thought ima have to try a few of the rubbers they provide till I get the right fit, nooooo, they actually fit perfectly the way the came, didn't have to open the box with the cable and the rubbers cause the case itself works with wireless charger, so basically that's all u need, no cables whatsoever, 2 earbuds and one little case, how awesome is that???
Oh,And the sound quality, I like how one earbud keeps playing music while the other lets you know someone is calling or that the battery goes low, it's like 3D sound, or something like that
I sincerely recommend this product and trust me, you'll love 'em",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely worth it!,"Great buy!
Good quality from the box to where it came in to the material used to make the charger box. I’m extremely impressed with it. I would expect this from Bose or those expensive earbuds. Well done Tonzo

Sounds amazing. Easy to use. I have a weird shape ear so normal earbuds won’t stay in. This will. I skip rope, run and hit the box. They stay in as long as you don’t knock them off they lll stay in.

Solid wireless blue tooth ear buds!,"This is my second pair, the first I left on a vacation.  I was happy with them and price was reasonable so I purchased again.  At first I was worried because they would not stay in my ears but I simply changed out the rubber ear pieces and they stay in perfectly.  I lift weights and run with them.  I have no problems with them coming out.  No issues with sweat or water.  Sound is great, bass is very noticeable and battery life is good.  They work perfect for me!  Oh, I also used them on the air plane and helped keep out ambient noise a lot like my more expensive noise cancelling.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really good for the price,"I got these a few months ago. For the most part they have been really good. I often use them when I am working out with no problems. In areas that have a lot of signals (other bluetooth devices or otherwise) sometimes sound cuts out, particularly on the lefthand side. Generally the only time I've experienced this however is at work (I work in a QA lab that has hundreds of devices online at the same time in close proximity).

Sometimes the audio is out of phase. Sometimes it doesn't pair or turn of upon taking the device out of the charging case, but it's easy enough to cycle power and after that it's fine.

Overall I'm pretty happy with them. They are cheap and they get the job done.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Nice--but not great for running,"I like this for weight lifting at the gym as I don't have to constantly keep picking up my phone (as I would with wired ear buds).  The sound is great.  But when I run, I hear my heart beating in my ears, and my footsteps echo loudly in my ears, so it's a lot of noise.  I like these.  They're easy to use; I just don't like running with them, so I end up brining two pairs of ear buds to the gym.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"You will know this is a quality product as soon as you see, hold and use them.","The TOZO T10 has a beautiful design and the earbuds are very comfortable for hours of use. The sound is awesome with the deeper bass. There are four sizes of caps, so try all for the best fit. Not sure why the xl are different but worked just fine for me. I have used these earbuds working in the yard, at the gym, walking and shopping, never having to readjust. With the sound level high, the world is tuned out. Lower levels one can have a conversation without raising one’s voice. Having the storage case as a charger is genius. Overall, I am really pleased with my purchase and highly recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Thank youuuuuuu!,I was cautious about these but boy am I happy! I have tiny ears and I didn’t think they’d stay but they do 🥰 the smallest ear bud works it’s like a suction cup you have to wiggle them it’s and it’s game over. Great sound quality and nice charging case. I haven’t tried swimming in them but it’s cool that they’re waterproof! Mine is black ❤️,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

<preface this review noting the following was gleaned with over 1 month of usage, on 2 different units, as the inital order was VERY susceptible to cutting out/losing phone pairing. Hardly worked at all, actually – just enough that i liked the potential and opted for a replacement to see if something got past QC...whatever form QC takes for Tozo>

<second context provider: this is the only pair of wireless ear buds i've ever used. it's easy to see on Amazon, as well as crowd-funded sites, that this form-factor is the currently, predominate iteration. case/dock that serves as recharger; buds very close, if not exactly the same, shape and general layout; claims of Bluetooth 5.0 and typically IPX6, 7 or 8, although these T10s are the only IPX8 rated i recall seeing.>

<CAVEAT each and every one of us really should keep in mind as we happily shop away online, wherever that may be: WHO or WHAT centralized agency, reputable or not, is testing and certifying these products?
by exactly what measure is it that products are found to actually be and do what the things ""marketing"" indicates is so? Hmmm???...lets think on that for a moment...instead of blindly swallowing whatever hook is cast before us and then complaining that we've a hook embedded in our mouth.

that said – IDK where to go to get reputable answers to the obvious questions regarding online (only, typically) product in 2019. if someone does, please post under this review cos I damn sure would like to explore that further.
moving along to this item...>
-------------------------------------------
it is unfortunate, really – as otherwise, there is MUCH to like about this ear bud set up:

* the price was outstanding, at least for this purchase as it was made during a lightning/gold box – whatever Amazon calls their countdown-timed deal opportunities. in my case, it was $29.99. what i paid is actually the teetering point for me as my inner-monologue vacillates between ""when they work, i really do like these...and they were astoundingly inexpensive"" to ""when they cut-out or lose bud-to-bud pairing, no price compensates for resulting escalation of irritation to aggravation..."" but as far as evaluating on price relative to sound, feature set and (mostly present) functionality +2

* surprisingly good sound, incl much more low-end than was expected, particularly as one ought remember, they're wireless, fairly small form, ear buds. think about that for a moment...personally, i'll put them firmly between a good set of cans and any of my wired buds, of which i have a half-doz, incl some decent Sony's and a set of Bose sports – granting the Bose are not in-ear buds; which makes a CONSIDERABLE difference in sound quality, as well-fitted in-ear buds both better block outside noise and seal desired audio's path, directing toward the eardrums. +2

*voice calls show well, both from the send and receive side. i have one colleague who routinely complains about calls made either through my car's bluetooth-connected system (mic is in steering wheel) or the now out-of-production Jawbone Icon – yet he's made no comments about my use of these buds, which tells me they're doing the job and then some. i have also made calls to other parties, for the purposes of testing call quality, and no one has observed any issues. my ability to hear and communicate effectively has been surprisingly good, although i haven't yet tested the buds on a call driving down the road with the windows open, or through a call standing outside on a windy day. the Jawbone did a pretty nice job with purported, military-grade noise-cancellation; not sure what/if considerations are employed to that end in these T10s. +1.5

* fit/form is comfortable and stays in place – albeit w/o any running around. my most active conditions involve wearing while operating a residential, riding mower over uneven terrain, getting on/off, sweating were the most vigorous, operational conditions. they can droop some, and they do get a bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours, but then, show me some ear-buds that don't. +1

* battery life was good (roughly 3-hrs) and the recharge time (via an unplugged, but charged, case/dock) seemed to be about 45-minutes in very generally observed times. IOW, i did not run down the buds, break out the stopwatch, note start/stop times; just looked at the clock when initiating recharge and then again when lifted. +1.25

* i get that this form-factor—charging a case/carrying buds in case for on-the-go, cord-free recharging, IS the way these many, many iterations of wireless, BT earbuds are presently made—can't really be attributed to Tozo, but the functionality of the ""case as charger"" has real value. specific to this case, Tozo appears to use rare-earth magnets, resulting in small form and commensurately strong magnetism. very good for keeping that lid closed and your buds in the case where they belong. i've had my case hanging on my technician's toolbag for a couple of weeks now and have yet to find the lid opening on its own, or of course, my buds out of the case other than when i pull them out. the buds themselves are magnetically drawn into the form and onto the charging contacts, once you've got them most of the way inserted. +1.25

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:

*most necessarily, and glaring, is the frequent and random connectivity drop: some times it was the Rt-ear (phone pairing) bud from the phone, despite the phone's proximity sitting next to me in my mower's cup holder or in my front shorts pocket, ALWAYS on my right side. other times, it was Lt-bud connectivity loss to Rt-bud, despite the buds having recent charge. this happens FAR TOO FREQUENTLY and does so while they're worn – making it an obvious engineering/technical flaw. Surely the distance through a human's head is so similar that nailing down electronics appropriate to afford solid connectivity across this distance and through incredibly similar material (flesh/bone/brain/bone/flesh) or around the same, should be made certain before this product hits market.
add the pairing drop that i easily—with about 90% consistency reproduced—initiated by tightly cupping an ear with one hand...now that i type this, would seem the bud-to-bud pairing is made with shockingly short-range/weak electronics. so, forget going through the head, these have trouble going AROUND the head and are interrupted by nothing more than the composition of an ungloved, human hand and some of the time, nothing more than...air?
back to the drawing board or lab, Tozo... -5.5

presuming that deal-breaker gets corrected, next suggestion is

* add a feature that makes it clear that the buds are fully charged. update the voiced component to include current battery-life status, or put a meter on the case that provides visual status of the same, or change that LED series (essentially serves as a meter, but with 4-LEDs lined up vs a numeric display) from blue to green, or even better, have the earbuds' go from red to green? there is no way to know how much life left the buds have, other than the voice prompt that kicks in and repeats 3 or 4 times that the battery is low. the auto power-off function comes pretty swiftly thereafter, which is fine, but outside of this, the user has no way to know the buds current, charged state of being. this is kind-of irritating, really.
as it is, appears the display times out. If the buds are lifted from the charging case with a full charge (?), the buds change to blue. Put them right back in the case, they revert to red and sit that way until timing out – unless the battery life is so erratic/poor that a full-charge isn't really a full-charge, or is until lifted from direct charge contact, or...see what i'm saying, Tozo? -1.5

Nit-picky suggestion here, but valid all the same:

* make the charging case/dock's molded loop a wee bit larger. not sure what Tozo expects would be looped through this, but it is too small—without modification—for anything other than a string. i have several cables w/screw-together, end crimped connectors that are typically used for/found in; keeping together keys. the 1/8""  threaded end of this cable would not fit through the loop. i took a very small, sharp utility knife and shaved off little bits of plastic on the case-side (not the loop-side) of the loop, until i was able to get the threaded end of my cable's connector through the opening.
my workaround now ensures i can easily and securely attach the buds' case to a carabiner, a tool bag, a belt-loop (although haven't done that), etc. -1

RESULTS: with this highly unscientific and also highly arbitrary summary of my Tozo T10 observations, based on just a a couple of week's sporadic usage with the initial purchase, followed by several, much more intensive weeks now with the ""replacement"" unit...it's a wash.

would i say to someone who doesn't already have a strong interest in wireless, ear-buds, ""rush out and buy these""?
i would not.
would i encourage someone to try this or a different maker to see if another has defeated the paramount and absolutely necessary condition of consistent and persistent pairing to both phone and bud-to-bud? sure, why not – return them in within the appropriate time frame if they're no bueno.

what's to say that should i go to and through a third set of Tozo's T10s they'd not work splendidly? seems unlikely, but...or that another manufacturer has nailed some technical shortcoming and consideration that appears to have eluded Tozo's grasp? w/o going down that road, can't know.

for me, relative to my specific instance and most definitely considering the price paid and approximately 80% up-time in which the buds work as expected, coupled with already having backup, alternatives if/when the T10s get too exasperating, i'll probably just keep them. reach out to Tozo–if that's even possible w/o further time-suck as has been already been spent in grappling the issue, contacting Amazon multiple times to correct some bizarre-to-me SNAFU in which reviews for this product were disallowed due to (my paraphrased summary here) some goofiness with reviews and legitimate account, product purchases and now the subsequent, even-further time-suck of typing out this loooong overview...but roll the dice and pay full price ($49.99 as of this review's post)...nah.

i suspect the technology is suuuuper close, but just isn't.quite.there.yet to pull off what is trying to be done with the wireless ear-bud market.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bad Quality Music,"Rarely do I leave a bad review, but I was so disappointed at the quality. $5 earbuds from Walmart sound roughly the same. Not worth even half what I paid, so I'm returning. Two stars because they did provide multiple sized buds and seem like they'd be decently water resistant. Still-would not recommend buying.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best earbuds i've purchased,"These are the best earbuds i've purchased.  I was contemplating on buying the airpods, but decided to look around for a bit.  Im glad i decided to wait on the airpods, because these are awesome.  The sound and bass are amazing. They come with 4 sets of ear cushions, so you can use the ones that best fit your ear shape.  I definitely recommend these earbuds, and will be buying more for my family.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic sound and total comfort.,"Fantastic earbuds!  I have been through 4 different brands of earbuds and these are far superior to the others. The sound is crisp and clear whether talking on my iPhone or listening to music. The bass will wow you! But tops on my list of “wows” is how comfortable they are. I forget I am wearing them, and then my phone rings!
Thank you Tozo for a superior product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Impressed!  These things are awesome!,"I was on the market for a new pair of headphones, i've tried all kinds of headphones in the past and wanted to give a pair of fully wireless earbuds a shot.  I tried a pair of airpod looking earbuds once that had great reviews (I later found out they were fake... come one Amazon) but threw them away after two days. Even though I was a little hesitant I decided to give the Tozo T10s a shot and ordered them.

The packaging is nice and includes a 3"" x 3"" guide that includes wearing steps on one side and pairing steps on the other.  Pairing is easy, as soon as you take the earbuds out of the case, they power on.  You then just pair the right earbud to your device and the left will automatically pair.  The case is also really nice, there are magnets on the top of the lid and on the case itself so when closing the case you get a pleasant snap when the two sets of magnets attract each other.  The earbuds sit nicely in the case and are also held in by magnets so the charging elements on the case and earbud make good contact.

There are are four blue LEDs in the case to signify the charge level that blink as the charging case is being charged.  When the earbuds are charging a red LED is visible on the earbud.  There are two ways to charge the case, either through the included micro USB cable or wireless charging.  The actual case itself can be charged wirelessly if placed on a charging mat which I love and such an awesome feature for the price!

The main reason I chose these was because they are completely wireless.  I run three times a week are started out just using the wired headphones, the wires became annoying, so I ordered a pair of wireless sports headphone that just have a wire connecting each earphone.  They were good but the wire still bothered me. My second run using these headphones was a sweaty 11 miles and I had no issues whatsoever, not having to adjust the headphones was awesome.

In summary these earbuds are great, for the price the features are amazing, they are comfortable and sound great.  Definitely recommended!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for wireless calls.,"I'm a realtor and need wireless headphones that work well and are discreet. I've had these for a little over a month and haven't had any issues with calls. Everyone can hear me clearly.

Outside of work, I love wearing them to the pool (no they don't work underwater, but no bluetooth signal can), to the shower and gym. They dont fall out, no matter how much cardio and jumps I do. I've gotten. Them wet multiple times with no issues.

The two negatives I have ( but don't warrant losing a star) are that they don't auto connect to my phone when turned on, and if you walk away and there's a wall between them and the phone, it'll start to cut out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Are not made for dancing...,"Terrible. I have been testing it with multiple devices. iPod, Galaxy Note8 and TV. Certainly you can't commute with it if you are MOVING... my lower half moves and the audio continues to cut off and come back.
I tested it with the phone and iPod... you have to keep your device steady in order to keep the audio playing without interruptions. I'm so dissatisfied with this purchase. I wanna dance with this but you can't keep your device in your pocket because it can't keep up with your movement and the connectivity of the earphones. Don't recommend.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Heavy bass headphones,"TLDR: Too much bass and/or weak treble, and design shortcomings take away a star, but overall a good set of earphones.

The sound quality of these earphones are decent, but the low-end either overcomes the high-end, or the earphones just don't produce the high-end well. The overall sound is a little muddy due to this, but if you like bass you probably won't be disappointed.

Both earphones are the same, meaning you can wear either in either ear. I use them individually often, so this is a bonus for me as I usually prefer my left ear being clear. They do beep for a bit if you try to use them individually, but if you do it right they only beep for a short while.

On the initial charges, I am getting well over 3 hours of play time.

The earphones fit comfortably into my ears, but be careful to choose the right tip. The function button on the earphones is mechanical, meaning you have to press it to activate. The button is very stiff, so you have to press pretty hard, and if you aren't careful, you will be shoving the earphone deeper into your ear, which can be painful. After a few tries you can figure out how to press the button without jamming the earphone into your ear canal.

The pairing and bluetooth signal strength are both good. I haven't had any issues pairing, both as a pair and singularly, and I consistently move 2 rooms away, 25-30 ft through 2 walls, and haven't had any issues with the signal cutting out.

The case is simple and straightforward. It has a charge level indicator, but no way to activate it unless you plug in a charging cable, which is a flaw. I don't use any wireless charging pads so I can't test that function.

The microphone tested okay. It picked up the audio at a decent volume, and wasn't garbled or muffled. I tested multiple times, and each time it seemed to glitch just for a half second every single time, but overall it worked well enough.

In comparison of these earphones to the iKanzi X9, and the Enacfire E20, these would rank number 2 on my list. These Tozo brand earphones sound much better than the iKanzi ones, which had no bass at all, but the iKanzi was overall much better designed and had better features. The Enacfire E20 has all the awesome features and great design of the iKanzi, AND has the best sound out of all three. I would pay a little more and go with the Enacfire E20 earphones.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bad Bluetooth *EDITED*,"The unfortunate problem I encountered with these earbuds was that they would constantly lose connection with whatever I had them paired with. Even if it were just my phone in my pocket, my music or podcast would intermittently stop. This would happen pretty frequently, too, making for a rather annoying experience. The sound quality was actually pretty good, but again, the bluetooth capabilities were not great. The battery seemed to drain rather fast, too. These should be more accurately priced around $20 in my opinion.

EDIT* - I have been contacted by TOZO and they are offering to replace the earbuds at no expense to me. The customer service has been very accommodating, and if the new earbuds arrive in working condition I will gladly give them 5 stars.
EDIT** - I received my replacement pair of headphones from TOZO at no cost and they work perfectly. The first pair of headphones I got were defective and the new pair works great. Great customer service, too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones will buy again,"They are lightweight and don't fall out while working or working out. Great sound quality and noise cancelation. I use these at work everyday.

Great fit!,"I ordered these earbuds so I could listen to music in my slow working time. I was really happy when I opened the box and saw the quality of the product. The sound is amazing with clear bass and well define upper register. At the time I write this review, I can only say that I didn't get to the end of the battery life and did not use the charge that the case carries.

Worked great for awhile,"I really liked these when I first got them.  Sound quality was pretty great, and they paired flawlessly.  However, within a week they began to unpair the left side every few minutes.  So sound would turn off, then only come in through the right side, and then slowly fade back in on the left.  This happened while I was working out 3 feet from my phone so I'm pretty sure I wasn't out of range.  I returned them and requested a new pair.  I'll update this review if the new ones turn out better.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Skip the cost of AirPods!,"I love these earbuds! The shape of many versions over the years (non-wireless) made my ears sore.

I love my Tozos!,"As you can see in the photo above, I attached my Tozo case to my purse so I could tuck it inside and not worry about losing it. They come FULLY charged so you don't have to wait to enjoy them and they are a WONDERFUL purchase in both value and quality. I work in a call center that can have a lot of downtime between calls and was able to use mine since I received them on 4/21 and didn't have to charge them again until 4/26. I would say that was with frequent and heavy use. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these earbuds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
FANTASTIC SOUND AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I don't normally leave reviews but i had to for these little beauties. The sound quality is fantastic with no bleed through from the world around me. Once I found the right cup size for my ear they just popped right in with no discomfort and no independent movement from the ear puds at all. I haven't used them long enough to test the battery life yet but so far I have very happy with them.
EDIT: I've been using these for about a month or so now and the battery life more than meets my needs.
The left ear bud developed an issue where it would randomly and frequently disconnect from the right side. i looked into it and it seems this is an issue with a very small percentage of users. HOWEVER I contacted the company and they are sending me a new set right away. Overall I am still very satisfied. Fantastic sound quality and great customer service.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
bad  sound quality,"Now sure how these got such good reviews. They sound terrible.

Broken left earbud,"They sound great and do a very good job of noise cancelling. It sounds like I'm standing in an empty room and all you can hear is your music playing, even when I'm at the busy gym with the gym's loud music playing.  However, the left ear piece constantly cuts out then fades back in and crackles occasionally as well. Even when I'm holding my phone right next to them. I did that just to make sure I wasn't interfering with the connection somehow. I have sent for a new set. If they work without a problem I will be very pleased. I will keep them at 4 stars because of the hassle of returning them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Amazing,MY FAVORITE wireless/Bluetooth headphones ever. I use these when I’m riding my motorcycle and I’m surprised at how well these work. The noise cancellation is excellent and I’m still able to listen to my music without interruption. On major highways at top speeds the earbuds didn’t even move. The only minor downside is that you’re unable to change songs via headset which was able to do.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A Bit Disappointed,"A bit of a let down for me because of no control features and staticky.  This is one of the best sounding earbuds on it's price point.

  I oredered the white cersion.  Nice and sleek look
  The case is very nice.
  Loudness is very good. My phone's volume is at 50% for comfortable listening.

The Cons: No control features to forward or rewind
  No volume adjustment.
  When i put my phone in my pocket during walks or running, the earbuds keeps disconnecting.  Something

Not Working After One Week,"Rare for me to leave a product review but sadly in this case I felt it was warranted.  Initially, a very positive experience with these earbuds - nice packaging and design.  As others noted, recharging case is a little on the plasticky side but it does the job.  Set up was straightforward with my iphone (although read instructions about just pairing right earbud).  Overall, sound quality was pretty darn good - particularly in the bass range.  Apart from some occasional syncing issues with the left earbud, the first week went great until it didn't.  Left earbud issues increased until it just stopped working altogether.

"Decent, but has issues","Pros
Good sound quality but nothing to write home about
Very, very loud. I normally run headphones at around 75% volume, these are closer to 50%
They come with different sized plugs so getting one that fits your ear even while running will be easy, unless you're Dumbo or Voldemort
Battery life on charger is decent. You can charge the buds around 3 times. Also the wireless charging is a nice addition

Cons
Battery life is advertised so can't really fault them for that but still wants something to be desired
No next or previous song control on the device which can be a pain. If you're listening to music and you want to skip whatever song came on you have to pull your phone out of your pocket, which is annoying
You can use just the right one, but to do so you have to connect the left one then put it back in the charger. If you don't you'll be continuously met with a beeping sound as it's trying to pair with the left one. Also, if you try and turn off the left one it will turn off both, so only option is putting it back in its case.

Overall, solid pair of true wireless earbuds with a couple of annoying features, or lack thereof. Nothing incredible, but worth the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are worth the money,These really are a great pair of earbuds last longer than my Samsung the only problem which really isn't a problem the box was beating up real bad but nothing was messed up Inside the Box I give it a 5-star on all cuz they were so good about a second pair,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Much cheaper and comfortable alternative!,"What do I love? It's a 1/3 of the price of AirPods, and much cheaper than other brands;
they are comfortable and remain in the ears more easily;
the sound quality is amazing and clear, plus I hardly have to turn up the volume at all to hear the music well in a normal environment;
they really are totally waterproof – I can easily listen to the radio, podcasts or music while showering in the morning!

My only ""drawbacks"" would be:
you do have to charge them at least daily — but again, this is pretty standard for wireless earphones that use lots of battery, so it's hardly a drawback really;
they don't always pair to each other or connect instantly to your device — I think it usually depends on the strength of whichever device's Bluetooth signal — and sometimes I need to manually open Bluetooth settings on my iPhone to manually connect the earphones. Since these earphones are not an Apple product however, it is understandable that they won't connect as smoothly as AirPods would.

Great for the gym-goer.,"I have been using wireless headphones at the gym (and for running) for years. However, this is the first time I have had completely cordless headphones... and I am SO happy with the switch. I was concerned with the headphones falling out, but with multiple ear bud sizes included with this set, I was able to get the perfect fit. I'm an audio/video guru of sorts... and the audio is really solid. You may get a little better sound quality from higher end headphones, but these have a great, full sound... good lows. They connect and work like they are supposed to, and they block out most the sound around you. Leaving just a little tiny bit of room for some ambient noise... which is to be desired so we can remain spatially aware when the volume isn't up really high. These are not made for making phone calls (the mic is technically at your ear), but will work just fine if you get a call in the middle of something and don't want to switch to your phone.

I am not a big fan of charging my headphones every couple days, so the protective case acting as a charger is pretty awesome. They clip into their little bays magnetically, which is super satisfying... and the charger lets you know how much juice it still has with some small LED indicators.

I highly recommend these headphones at the price point, and I am very happy with the results I've gotten. If you're not looking to spend at least twice as much, you're going to struggle finding a better pair of wireless/cordless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best by Far!,"This is this first pair of bluetooth headphones that don't hurt my ears or fall out. It was a lot easier to connect to my phone as well.

VERY CLEAR SOUND,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FIRST, AND I FELT SOMETHING WRONG NOT HAVE CONNECTION IN THE LEFT SIDE, GLADLY , THEY REPLACE IT FOR ME. THE NEW ONE ARRIVED AND BOTH ARE GOOD,I PUT NEW SIZE FOR MY EAR SO WILL NOT POP OUT. GOOD PRODUCT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT RIGHT. THANKS I REALLY HAPPY NOW BY THE PRODUCT.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Searched them all- this one's best,These are a great value for the sound you get. I researched for a week watching videos and reading reviews. These earbuds have all the latest features you'd find on more expensive ones. The key to getting the most out of the sound is fitting the earbuds to your ears. It comes with 5 different size gel ear-caps so that is easy for any size ears. I'm very pleased with these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good so far,"So far these earbuds are great! I love the color, and sound quality. The battery life is very good so far. I also ordered the wireless charger which is also good. The earbuds automatically connect to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus) as soon as I take them out of the case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Was skeptical, but pleased","I'm not overly a fan of the kind of headphone that go in your ear like this, but the generous inclusion of four different interchangeable sized ear pieces really gave the option of the most comfortable fit.

I used them in and around the pool and they are still 100% functioning.

Noise cancelation is amazing for me in my loud house and the sound quality isn't metallic at all like I've had with other wireless headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Reception,I absolutely love this product! I bought 2 sets for me and my guy. He loves them as well. Great choice....the reception is ultra clear! Worth every penny!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great so far!,I originally bought a set for my wife to use during gym workouts. She liked the fit and sound. She said they worked well on the treadmill. After my wife told me this I switched from my old wired buds that I use for yard work to these TOZO wireless earbuds. I use them for working on our farm. I have used them for mowing and while using my weed eater. I love the noise cancellation while I’m mowing because I can barely hear my mower while music is playing. I’ve used these while using my chainsaw under my normal earmuff hearing protection. These earbuds work well during all usage conditions so far. I bought the first set for myself about a month ago and so far so good. I bought a third pair for office use. These buds are a great bargain for the sound and fit. I read reviews that said the left earbud cuts out intermittently. I have not experienced this problem. While working I leave my phone on a workbench while I move around and I haven’t experienced any problems. GREAT EARBUDS!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bad battery life.,The sound is great.  They disconnect once in a while. The battery life is 2 1/2 hrs no more than 3. Was going to return them to get the newer model which claims the battery life is 5 hrs. But its too late to return.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Defective Battery Case on Multiple Units,"I have gone through two of these in the last week, both of which were defective.  The first worked completely but when placed on a wireless charger, the bottom-left side of the battery case would become extremely hot (so much so that it made the charging pad overheat as well).  I set up an exchange with Amazon and received my second unit in two days.  That one would not even charge on a wireless charger (though USB charging worked fine).  I tested both of these units on multiple wireless chargers that have charged and continue to charge my phone just fine and reproduced both of their issues.  I intend to replace with a different brand and steer clear of this brand in the future.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"They work, and work well .","So the first off these worked really well for me. The fit in the ear and come with 6 ear tips to see what works.  The sound quality is good, they are loud and clear. I was shocked they actually staid in my ear with no issue. Its also slim enough charging case .  Also the using it to make calls was really nice, actually was better than my sony cans.

Now my only ""issue"" which i think would be a great idea to add for the future is a button on the case that shows its current battery level instead of needing to take out one of the buds and putting it back in. Oh and also the cover for the micro usb to charge is a pain to open its in there good.....which is for the water resistance but still.  People were talking about issues with it cutting out, I only experienced it one time but after that its hasn't happened since .

I would love it if a future incarnation had the ability to access google assistant but for the price, I think it $40 when i got them on sale I'm not arguing .

All together these are great for when im on the bus to work, working out, or mowing the lawn. So far has been worth it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Actually, pretty impressive","After being a die-hard, no frills runner for the past 45 years, never worn any type of headset, decided to try them out after reading about different types in a recent national running magazine.  These weren't included in the article but found them when researching across the internet and Amazon.  Can't beat the price = value, overall fit is perfect, easy set up to my iPhone, simple to use, and hence my headline of 'impressive'.  Only had them a week, will check back after a few months of daily use and onset of winter months on the horizon.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good earbuds!,"I have been using these earbuds for about a month now, and I am happy with them. The sound is crisp and clear, they block enough outside noise that I have to remove a bud if someone wants to talk to me, and they were easy to pair. The one small thing I note is that the right bud, for me, doesn't fit perfectly, and feels like it's slightly loose. I have had luck turning it towards my face and it seems to fit better. The buds otherwise fit securely and I'm not worried about them falling out, even while running, stair runs, and jumping jacks. I use them about 2.5 hours per week on one charge, and they have never run out of juice.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Battery life is shitty, don't be fooled by the good reviews","Sound quality is excellent. However, battery only stays charged for 1-2 hours at a time (very disappointing! I've gotten worse quality overall headphones that at least  stayed charged for 5-6 hrs) and the earbuds fall out of my ears if I'm not sitting completely still and don't move at all. I have the smallest of the """"comfort"""" tips in (my ears are irritated from having to re-shove them in every five minutes, though I should say I've had this problem with other headphone manufacturers of this type), no dice. Just not practical for me, but I desperately need headphones--any headphones--so I won't be returning them.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Finally, found ear buds that can keep up with me on MTB trail","I was about to pay for powerbeats pro, thinking i needed to pay serious money for something that actually works.

Not only are these comfortable / feel good in they also withstood one of my longer rides where my sweat didn't kill them. I'm sold and recommend these to anyone.

Worked great until it didn't,Worked great for a little over 4 months but then get quiet and continually disconnects or fades in and out. Unsure why as they worked great before and have had no physical damage.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Work for a month and then die?,So this product lasts until just past the return window. Convenient. They worked perfectly fine for a month. Then over the last week have not held a charge and there is zero way to contact about this. The support is only for setting up. But they simple pretty peices of plastic and wires now. No matter how long I charge them plugged in or on the base. They work for 10 mins and then blink low and turn off almost instantly. Would be nice if I could get a replacement or just a refund so I can try a different brand. This. Sucks.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The high number of good reviews seem warranted so far,"Disclaimer:
- I'm not an audiophile. My main use case for these earbuds is listening to podcasts.
- It seems like TOZO will offer to send you a free wireless charger for the case if you activate the warranty. In the email, they'll encourage you to write a review so that's my primary reason for writing a review.

Pros:
- One year warranty. TOZO is very upfront about their warranty (they include a small card with a QR code for activation in the box) which is a good sign for the service. I've owned three wireless earbuds so far (1 had poor audio quality out of the box, 1 broke after a year and a half, and I lost the case for the other), so it's reassuring to have this warranty.
- Good fit. TOZO includes several different ear tips in the box (there were 3 additional pairs in mine though one pair did not look like the rest of them and didn't really fit the earbuds so I wonder if that was a packaging mistake). The standard ones did not fit me well, but the bigger ones did so I am thankful they included the different ear tips.
- Sound quality is solid. The podcasts I listen to sound great on these earbuds. After listening to some music on these earbuds, I would say that the sound quality does seem a little lacking. For $50 though, I think the sound quality definitely acceptable.
- Case seems to have good build quality. It just seems like a nice and sturdy case. The lid doesn't snap open/close in a way that makes me feel like it'll break earlier than expected. Also nice is that there's four lights that indicate the amount of charge left in the case.

Cons:
- There's a disconnection lag. The earbuds will connect automatically and fairly quickly to my phone when I pull them out of the case. When I put them into the case though, there's a 6-7 second lag before they finally disconnect from my phone which is a bit odd.
- Case is kind of bulky. It's a little taller and wider than three quarters in a row so it's definitely one of the bulkier cases I've seen. Also another minor note on the case is that there's a cover on the charging port that is a bit to take off at first.
- There's a lot of voice lines during connection. This is more of a minor annoyance but the amount of ""Power on"", ""Connected"", ""Second Device"", ""Left channel"", ""Right channel"" voices when you put them on is excessive. A simple ""left connected"", ""right connected"" would be sufficient.
- There's red accents on the earbuds. This is another minor complaint but why add red to something that is completely black? I should've noticed because you can see it in the product pictures, but it does make me wish I considered buying the white earbuds.

Other Notes:
- They claim that the earbuds + case can last a 12.5 hours which isn't super impressive but should be fine for my purposes since I will typically never use them for more than an hour at a time.
- Waterproof functionality is cool. Haven't had a chance to see this in action.
- Wireless charging is nice considering how hard the cover for the charging port is to take off at first.
- Customer service is promising so far (the warranty and free wireless charger are good signs).",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Waste of money.,Half the time these things don't actually charge when they're in the case. Battery life indicators are never accurate. They'll turn on by themselves and pair with your phone when you're in the middle of a b phone call. Waste of money.

Outdoors or Indoors - great product,"I've only used this product a few days, but I love the ease of charging, the comfort, and the sound.  The sound is very close to listening to a Bose stereo with headsets on!  Charging is easing with the wireless case, and the charge lasts for hours! I really hope the earbuds last a long time, because I'm really loving them right now🤞",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"All the features you want, BEST product!","These are fantastic. I purchased these for wearing in the evening when I'm doing my skincare routine, so I can listen to podcasts after my husband has already gone to sleep. I needed something that wouldn't get in the way with wires/cords - even the kind that are ""wireless"" but are connected with a loop that goes around behind your head wouldn't work for me, because I apply all my skincare products to the back of my neck too! Don't neglect your neck, ladies! ;-) So I needed something that would allow true freedom of movement and not interfere in any way, but that would also STAY PUT in my ears. These definitely do that. It's great that they come with different sizes to custom fit your ear - I have small ears, and the smallest size is perfect for me! Very comfortable, and they stay put throughout my whole routine, even in pulling my headband on/off past my ears over my head.

The sound quality is great on these, just as good as my Apple earbuds if not better! I'm no audiophile, but even I recognized that it was noticeably clearer and smoother. The noise cancellation is also very good - not so over the top that I'm deaf to the rest of the world and oblivious if anything important happens and I am needed, but just right so that I hear what I'm listening to perfectly without other noise competition.

The bluetooth connection is incredibly fast and, after the first time of going into my phone and selecting these in the bluetooth menu, it automatically connected every time after that without me having to select them in the menu. Love that little extra feature. I just pop these out of their case, and they connect immediately, almost before I even have them in my ears!

Also I should mention the case - there were some other truly wireless earbuds I was considering (SoundPEATS brand), but the ""case"" they came in was open on the top, no cover. I know they're waterproof enough for swimming, showeing, etc., and I use them nightly so they aren't just sitting around literally ""collecting dust,"" but call me crazy - I like for my electronics to be protected. So I like that the case for these is ACTUALLY a case with a COVER. But I LOVE that it's translucent enough that you can see the battery light indicators at a glance!

In full disclosure, I will say the company emailed me AFTER I purchased these with my own money to ask that I review them, and offered to send me a complementary wireless charging base in return. However, they specified it should be an HONEST review, which it is! And I was so impressed with these I was already planning on reviewing them in the first place, so their offer was just a nice added bonus. These are a great pair of wireless earbuds all around, well worth the price, and with great performance. I will be purchasing another pair for my husband, and probably some more as Christmas gifts. HIGHLY recommend!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Better than the other reviewers say!,"These things are great!  Lots of bass, fit good, and mine lasted over 3 hours and 50 minutes on one charge!  They can be turned up so loud that they will blow your eardrums out.  I like loud music, but I can’t turn them up more than a little over half way before they are busting my head open!  I read a lot of the other reviews and was kind of skeptical, but after trying these I would have paid more for them.  Other people were saying that they kept losing connection, but even after almost 4 hours on one charge they still sounded amazing and did not cut out even once.  Charging time from the battery dock from completely dead to full charge was exactly one hour.  I am extremely pleased with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

EXCELLENT COST BENEFIT!!,"I purchased the earbuds about a month ago and so far I'm EXTREMELY satisfied with it.
Packaging is very well structured and protective, it brings the wireless charging case, a pair of earbuds themselves, four pairs of ear caps at different sizes and also a plug in charger and cable - besides a FREE 1 Yr EXTENDED WARRANTY card (that must be activated), a ""quick tips"" sheet and manual for complete instructions in 6 languages (EN, JP, DE, SP, IT, FR).
Extremely easy and quick to connect!!
Very PRACTICAL!! After first use, the earbuds turn on BY THEMSELVES once you remove them from the case.
Microphone works very well - never had complains from the person at the other side of the PHONE CALL nor heard s/he breaking up. You can answer or reject calls and even redial last number by click pressing the earbuds.
The sound quality is great, I always use them while EXERCISING and... it's really COMFORTABLE not having to remove them to take a shower as they're WATER PROOF!! You can play or pause songs by click pressing them too.
I never had an Apple or Samsung wireless earbud, which costs no less than $100-$150 but honestly DO NOT NEED IT AT ALL as my TOZO T10 earbuds DOES A GREAT JOB!! And... the BEST OF ALL, you can have them for a GREAT PRICE!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the price,"These are worth the price. I’d buy them again. The sound is not super consistent; almost like it changes back and forth from stereo to mono. And I don’t really notice great bass. The battery lasted about 2 hours or so before I got the low battery notification. I haven’t had them long so I don’t know how durable they are, and I haven’t tested the water proof quality. I’ve been able to move a couple rooms away from my phone before they start to cut out. I really like that they come with changeable earbud sizes! They’re pretty comfortable. I haven’t exercised with them yet, but they feel like they’ll probably stay put.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality wireless earbuds,"This makes the 3rd pair of wireless earbuds I've purchased  and the TOZO T10 earbuds have met my expectations so far.

But while wearing the TOZO T10 earbuds, my wife understands me clearly. The shape of the earbuds fit securely in my ear with out fear of them falling out. It comes with four different options of ear tips to choose from.  The case charger doesn't look as good as other cases but they make up for with quality ear buds .

"Great product, incredible sound","Like others have mentioned, Airpods are not for everyone. I was in search of a pair of truly wireless ear buds that fit my ears, and Tozo delivered. These ear buds are have a great form factor; small, but not too small where you lose them. The case is really nice too  – sturdy, easy to open (which was a big one for me) and the magnetic charging pieces are great. For me, personally, these fit perfect in my ear. The sound on these is also incredible. Tons of deep base, great highs, great mids... when they are in, the sounds is amazing. You'd think you're wearing a $200 pair of ear buds. My only issue with these is with movement, such as gym or fitness activity. They sound gets spotty and cuts in and out, which is the problem with almost every ear bud on the market that doesn't utilize the Apple W1 chip for connection. Overall, these are a great value in almost all applications other than aggressive fitness/physical activity.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Unit For the Right Application,"Sound and fit was really great.  These earbuds are great for walking or driving; but as soon as I started exercising vigorously and sweating during workouts (like workouts on elliptical), they pop out of my ears.  If they added a simple ear loop to the unit, that would take care of the issue of popping out.  I even took a call in the shower with unit in my ear and it worked perfect.

nice wireless earbuds,"I like these a lot. they are comfortable and have great sound quality. Just have one minor gripe with it.

Great: the Sound quality, it has a bass booster, and I adjusted my phone's equalizer, now it has even better-highs and lows, vocals, nice balance; Buds instead of dangling from my ears; Quick charge; Instant pairing, Easy calls.
Not so great: Very snug fit with smallest buds, didn't like putting them in with pressure inside ear canal. But I pull my ear lobes down and its much better putting them in.

Awesome sound for a budget price,I have tried several budget priced earbuds just to be disappointed. I was at the Bose store and tried theirs on that run $199 a pair. They sounded outstanding but out of my price range. Then I seen these TOZO's in several reviews and decided to try them out. I tell you they sound so close to the Bose one's I tried for a quarter of the price. I have had mine now for a couple weeks and I'm so impressed that I've been telling all my friends about them.

Great all-purpose earbuds,"I was skeptical about how securely these earbuds would stay in my ears. I did have to change the little pads but they stay perfectly, even when my ears got sweaty from running around in the desert heat.

Excellent.,"These a pretty great! I think sound quality is good, range is decent, and battery life is amazing. I do have to return the buds to the charging pack if I turn them off manually to get them to reconnect to my phone and on occasion one bud will cut out momentarily but this does not bother me much. Besides that, they’re not the most suitable for my ears as I’ve noticed when working out and building up a sweat they are fairly prone to falling out. However, walking, doing chores, and staying up right in general I have little to no issues.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, comfortable, but no music controls","Bought these earbuds to replace a pair that was dying. I was looking for something with Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, as well as not having a wire between the 2 earbuds, and this fit the bill, had good reviews, and was a reasonable price.

My expectations have been met. The earbuds were easy to setup out of the box, the instructions were clear, and the packaging was professional. (plus half star)

I use these mainly when I'm out jogging. The first time I wore them, I could barely feel them, they were comfortable and stayed put well. The second time I wore them, I noticed they were moving around a little more, and I had to constantly re-adjust them to get them to stay in. They do come with 4 different size ear tips, so I will try a different size for next time, and see if that works out a little better.

Each time I went out, I had them on for about 50 minutes, and didn't run into any low battery issues.

At one point, my wife and I decided to each wear one, so we could listen to the same song. She was on the right side of the sidewalk, with the right earbud, I was on the left with the left, and I noticed the left earbud was cutting out a bit. When we switched sides, so the 2 earbuds were closer to each other, the issue stopped happening. (minus half star)

Also, the buttons on either earbud will allow you to control calls (answer/hang up), or pause/unpause music. However, you can't use the buttons to advance/rewind music, or adjust volume. These are features that would have been nice to have. Particularly since each earbud has a button, it would have been nice if they each performed a different function (right side for answer/hangup/pause/unpause, left for fast forward?). (Minus 1 star)

I haven't received a call yet while wearing these, so I don't know what the voice quality is, and whether the person I'm talking to will be able to hear me or not.

Total 4 stars.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good purchase!,"These headphones are pretty good! The sound quality is surprisingly good. They cancel out outside noise really well and they stay in my ears just fine when running or lifting weights. A lot of complaints on not fitting right but if you twist slightly while putting in your ear it fits snuggly,  mine came with 3 different sizes and i had to use the smallest. The sound does cut out sometimes when im lifting weights but not as bad as some reviews make it out... when just sitting at work the sound is 100% and does not cut out.

Battery life is decent. Will last 3-4 hours on 1 charge and fully charges within 30 mins.

"Incredible sound quality and built quality, highly recommended!","The last time I bought a wireless headphone is last year with a Bose Quiet Comfort II. Owning another two wireless headphones from Taoelectronics in addition to the Bose, I do not have much expectation for this pair of tiny earbuds, but I was blown out of the water when first putting them on. The sound quality is vibrant and deep, and very comfortable, does not feel heavy at all.

I read many reviews before buying that mentioned about the lack of bass, which I found the complete opposite as these earbuds are kickin' hard, in which I have to turn down the volume. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, and these earbuds surpass my Taoelectronics headphones (Vava Moov 25) in 2014 by a mile.

I usually do not care much about the box presentation, but the company Tozo paid attention to their packaging. Outside is a clear plastic cover and the box construction is solid and well-made. I cannot justify spending more than $150 for a pair of Apple Airpods with a worse water-proof rating and sound quality.

The battery case is very well made and sturdy, the earbuds themselves are well made and completely sealed off so I will test using them under the rainy weather while working out. I hesitated to invest $40 in these earbuds, but this turns out to be the best upgrades ever. I will sure use these earbuds as much as my Bose QuietComfort II.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Expectations exceeded,These are LOUD..and I like loud music. The bass is heavy and the sound is clear. No issues pairing..both ears sound even. This is my first pair of earpods.

Great Headphones1,"First off, the headphones seem very durable. I’ve dropped them a few times and used them in rain and they held up well. The sound quality was a lot better than I was expecting and the bass is deep and not distorted. The range of the headphones from the device you are using does not reach as far as I would like, and the individual headphones need to be close together or they cut out bad. The only complaint I have is that the LED lights in the headphones do not turn off once they are paired and they continuously blink during use. While using the headphones at night it lights up the whole room and disturbs anyone else that is in there. I wish the led lights would only blink if the battery was low or if they weren’t paired.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Run 3 miles and I have to constantly push them in,"I bought these because when I run my chord was getting annoying on my workout headphones.

Also, I run 3 miles regularly and no slower than an 8 minute mile, and I have to constantly push these in so they do not fall out. I have small ears and have the smallest connectors on, but I will try a size up and see if it makes a difference. So far I am not disappointed, but I do not know any better yet.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Bit of a learning curve, but great overall!","I picked these up as a way to avoid bugging my housemates when listening to music and podcasts in the shower, and they work really well for that purpose! These are supposed to be waterproof, and thus far, this is proving to be true, although I should mention that I don't keep my head under the water the entire time I'm in. The charger/case is small and fits easily in my purse, and I like that it came with a little cord should I choose to wear the case instead. They also block sound fairly well and the sound quality itself is comparable with other headphones I use and enjoy. The case also seems to charge quite efficiently, and as long as I turn the buds off before replacing them, I don't have to charge the case very often - I only charge it maybe once every 1.5-2 weeks or so, and that's with daily use.

My only real complaints with the headphones are that 1) I can't seem to select buds that *perfectly* fit and stay in my ears, 2) it took me a couple days to realize that I should be actively shutting the buds off before putting them back in their case/charger,  3) they seem to want to shift a bit if I'm moving my jaw too much, and 4) the Bluetooth connection can be a touch finicky. The first issue is relatively minor, the second is on me because I should have read the manual more carefully (though it was a pain to put them in there and realize a couple days later that they were dead and so was the case), the third is on me because my jaw pops and moves more than it probably should. The connection issue is a bit of a pain, but is manageable; it took me some time to recognize how to best help the connection along by ensuring that my phone is thoughtfully placed in my pocket, or to make sure I'm not blocking the right-side bud too much. If you hold that bud in your hand (like clench it in your fist), the connection will cut out. If I lay down and have the right side of my head resting on my arm, the connection will cut out. However, I can also wander all around my decently-sized apartment without too much issue in terms of connection, regardless of whether my phone is on me, so this isn't a particularly major problem.

Ultimately, I really like these headphones, and they're working great for me for what I need from them. It took a week or so of consistent use to learn their idiosyncrasies, but now that I've got those down, they work perfectly fine for me. If you're okay with a slight learning curve, this is a solid choice of product!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Wireless Earbuds To Date,"I have purchased several wireless earbuds over the past few years. The TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds are by far the best ones i have owned. My older ones were bulky and stuck out of my ears too much, the max volume was not that loud and the battery would barely last me to the end of my gym sessions. That is not the case with these! Volume is loud and the sound is clear at that. They are extremely low profile and the battery lasts... ive gone 2 and 3 full gym sessions on one charge. The case is cool looking as well and easily connects to the buds to charge. Very satisfied with the product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Sounds Quality, Affordable Price","These wireless buds have amazing sound quality!! I've owned the other big brand and these are comparable, it's impressive!!

I anticipate enjoying these earbuds for a long time.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Fix to my IPhone Problem,"Ok so I have an iPhone and was so done with having one pair of earbuds for my computer and another for my iPhone and decided on these:

Pros: Fantastic bass, quick and easy pairing, fast charging, waterproof, stay in, long range, very attractive in ear look (not odd looking like AirPods which is why I was looking for other brands, yes I’m vain)

Cons: I wish that a double click on the side of the buds was a “next song” button and not a “redial” button but it doesn’t change anything honestly, just a possible improvement.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
GREAT TRULY WIRELESS EARBUDS,These are a decent pair of truly wireless earbuds for the price. Noise cancellation isn't the best. I could still hear sounds around me but I'm ok with that.  I use them on my Galaxy S8 and music sounds pretty nice especially if you can adjust the music EQ. Bass sounds good and sounds are clear and crisp. I used them in the shower and they worked fine. Even after getting them soaked. I do think if any moisture gets on the silicone piece that goes in your ear they could slip out. I'm sure if you have the right fitting silicone bud it could avoid this issue. It comes with extra silicone buds. But when dry you can run and jump in them and they'll stay in. Every now and then I feel like there is a frequency issue because sometimes the left bud will go in and out but not always. It's enough that I wouldn't mind putting up with it. The microphone on these for calls isn't so great. I find myself having to raise my voice and almost yelling so the caller on the other end can hear me. I'm a truck driver so that's kind of a big issue for me. But if your just looking for truly wireless headphones for music these will do just fine.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good product,",Pretty good product. They fit well in my ears and are small enough that they do not fall out while cross training or running. Connectivity was easy too. I actually bought a second pair for my brother!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Is it worth it?,"When I first got it, I thought the product was wonderful because I wanted to be optimistic about it since it was the first time I ever spent so much money on headphones. However, after a few days I noticed quite a few things about these earbuds.

They are not made for small ears (even if you change the silicone buds to the smallest size they have): It was very uncomfortable to wear and it did not fit comfortably in my ears. I think it's b/c my ears are so small (even though I'm sure it's normal size), but still it's good to be warned. I could not keep them in long, it was uncomfortable to sleep with and it kept heating up in my ears.

Battery life is not that long: I had to keep charging the earbud every hour even though the description said it would last 3 hours. The box that charges it lasts a while though, so that's a good thing and it doesn't take too long to charge for both.

Has limited capabilities: You can only press the button for play/pause and answer/end call. I don't think it says anywhere in the description about what it does exactly but I had the impression it could skip a song, turn up/down the volume, and have a great microphone (people can barely hear me when I call them).

The connection is not great: If you turn a certain way one of them cuts off continuously. It's usually the one with just a blue blinking dot. It does a little better at long distance but for some reason it can cut itself off or sound like static even when your not far from the connected devive.

Good things: The sound quality is great. It is noise canceling but I bought earphones that could do the same thing that were cheaper ($11). It has portable charging station that you don't have to charge too often. I'm not sure if it's waterproof since I've never tried it out.

Overall, I don't think it's worth the price you pay for it if it doesn't do it's most important function which is play sound (as I've said before it cuts on and off) so I am sending it back right away. If you can handle all of the things wrong with it then try it out for few days to see how it is.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Completely Blown Away!,"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.

I was happily mistaken.

The Pros: Right out of the box, these earbuds looked impressive. The housings on each earpiece have a matte, somewhat tacky (in terms of texture), black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). The earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out a decent layer of bass and produce a surprising clear range of mids and highs! The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range, and you can even keep them on while you take a shower/bath! The most satisfying part of this purchase was the $31 price tag. I'm struggling to include all of the positive aspects of these earbuds in one review!

The Cons: I'm not sure I can think of any at the moment! My only gripe would be that the earbuds don't remain completely in the ear when you start to move around, particularly while running/dancing. When this happens, the sound quality is noticeably reduced (since they start to fall out).

Pictured are the XL, L and S earpieces (in that order) as well as all included accessories. The M earpieces are attached to the earbuds.

*Note: I have yet to really test the limits of the battery life on these. I will update my review at a later date.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Air Pod Status,After reading all the reviews and noticing the 5 star ratings i was convinced into buying myself a pair of these earbuds and for a very good price too. The storage case it comes with is very nice and also a nice feature is once removed from the case (If gonna use) they automatically connect to your phone and once put into the case they disconnect and shutoff. the fit of the earbuds is not perfect for me cuz the outer earbud rubs against my ear which causes discomfort after more than a continuous hour of use but i use one and switch earbuds to keep comfortable but other than that great earbuds that alone block out sound and once the music plays it’s all YOU.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty impressed for the price!,"I bought these a month ago, so I wanted to try these out in a number of ways.  I'll address certain categories for this review: sound quality, range, battery life, comfort/fit, and ease of use.

Sound Quality
I'm very impressed with the sound quality, especially after trying out different settings in my iPhone's equalizer settings. I've found that ""Small speaker"" is the best overall mix for my ears.  The default setting was, to me at least, too strong on the treble and mid range, which washed out the bass and sounded a little bit annoying. But now the bass is about 90% as good as my Sony corded cordless earbuds. Try out a song like Jamie Liddell's ""A Little Bit More"" or Billie Eilish's ""Bury a Friend"" to test the depth of bass possible.

Range
I tested this aspect indoors, so it's probably different outside. It's kind of good news/bad news here.  Good news: with a clear line of sight to the streaming device (my phone in this case), I had a range of about 90 feet/27 meters. I did this by putting the phone on a bench on the side of an indoor walking track/basketball court.  I walked around the track and it held the signal 99% of the time. There were two interruptions, each lasting about .25 seconds that I can't figure out - they happened in different spots on the track, one near the phone and one far.

In the weight room (where I usually use these), I could set my phone down anywhere and walk around the rest of the room without loss of signal UNLESS I went around a corner (the bad news).  You really need line of sight for these to work consistently; any barrier or corner (even partially around a corner) and you'll get big cut outs and signal loss. It never completely lost connection, however, because I came back around the corner and it was fine again.

Battery life
I don't really know the run time of these because I use them for about 1-1.5 hours then put them back in their case, which charges them.  The case is nice: it's all black, and you can see through the lid to see the charging indicator.  As soon as you pick them up out of the case, they are on, connected, and ready to go. I charge the case (via micro USB cable) about once a week.

Comfort/fit
There are several different size ear cushions included, and it's really important that you try them all, even if you think you know which one is best.  Once I found the right size cushions, they fit great.  I've played basketball with them in and they stay just fine.  You put it in your ear in a vertical position, then twist them down to settle into your ear (see pics).  I can wear them about 1.5 hrs before they start to become uncomfortable.  I might still have to try different cushion sizes. Comfort and fit are adequate, but not great.

Ease of use
Good news/bad news again.  The good news is that once they are paired to your phone/device (which was easy to do: take them out of the charging case, go to your bluetooth menu, and select the earbud that has the ""R"" designation (both L and R will appear on your bluetooth list, but the L is a slave to the R so you only pair with the R).

I don't care for the button on these. You press it to pause the audio, but it also pushes it further into your ear when you do (you have to press hard to make the button click, no doubt a feature designed to prevent accidental button presses), which makes it uncomfortable.  Also, when I pressed the button, it did pause, but I couldn't unpause it. I had to use my phone to unpause, and even then a time or two I had to re-pair them to start the music again.

The charging case is nice: besides the see-through lid, the magnetic connection is snappy and good enough to keep them in place.  You know when they're properly seated by the sound of the magnetic click and the red light that then appears on each bud.

The only feature I haven't really tested (aside from sweating on them) is their waterproof-ness.

Overall, I like them, especially for the price point. You have to try different size ear cushions and different audio settings to get the best fit and sound, but they sound really good to me, a former user of Sony earbuds. At this point I would not hesitate to recommend them considering the review I just wrote.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What an awesome set for the price can't beat them,These buds are amazing. They sound better than the LG wireless headsets that I have had in the past. So far I am impressed with them and have had no issues.  The only thing that make even better is having a multiple assortment of the ear bud pieces for different size ear lobes.

"GREAT SOUND, BETTER DESIGN AND ITS CHEAPER.","Got this product only now and found it truly amazing in sound quality and in looks. And its cheaper compared to other high-end product.

Bought Bose Soundsport Wireless last weekend but ended returning it the same day at Frys. No doubt, the sounds are great in Bose but itmade me look like a human version of Shrek. Looks so bulky in my ears.

This one is cheaper, got better sounds, designs are way better and since I just got it, I am giving the battery life a 3 star, which to me is neutral.

You won't regret this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very great product!,"Overall excellent product! These also work great in the shower. The only thing I would have liked to see is the ability to have just one active at a time if desired. I use one earbud often for specific reasons, and I have to place a small piece of paper under the connectors in the case to keep the earbud I’m not using from turning off. This keeps the second earbud-disconnected-beep from repeating in the earbud I’m using. This is probably a highly uncommon situation, but thought I’d share it regardless. Again, these are an excellent product and I’m very please with them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"These fit In my holes so well, especially when wet!","These are awesome! They really cut down on external noise if you have them inserted correctly. Still allows a little noise to get through but as good as any others I’ve used. The battery last for 3 charges as advertised, the bud itself last around an hour and a half per charge.  Have gotten them wet twice with no issues. So far so good!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
T10 earbuds great choice,"The have a very good sound quality. Bass is decent for their size. They sync up to each other every time you take them out of the charger and it only takes a second. Nothing for you to do, it happens automatically.

Once paired to your phone, they will connect to it automatically whenever you take the right earbud out of the  charger.  This also happens quickly.

The bus and case feel much more expensive than they are. The lid of the charger is magnetic and closes with such a satisfying sound I find myself constantly snapping it open and closed in my hoodie pocket. You'll see what I mean. Like closing a Motorola razor flip phone if you remember those.

I've only made one phone call on them, and the person on the other end couldn't hear me very well but I could hear her. Not perfect but doable.

I cant comment on staying in during athletic activity. I wear them at work under other hearing protection.

The tozo charger does accept a charge from my Samsung  s10+ but it takes a few tries to get it started. At home, on a charging pad they charge as soon as you set them down.

I am very happy with these earbuds and I would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound - stays in place,"This was my first set of earbuds that were completely wireless (all my previous had a strap that connected the two buds). I was very skeptical that they would stay in during my workouts. I was amazed at how they fit so comfortably and stayed in place even with heavy sweating. I'm not an audiophile, but I found the sound quality great - way better than what I had previously been using. I also found the noise cancellation to be quite effective.

I very much enjoy these earbuds and would recommend based on quality and value for the $.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lots of drawbacks.,"Connection is poor quality at best...just brushing by the earbuds will interrupt the signal and it's repeatable and consistent. All the while the device that it's connected to is literally right next to the earbuds.

Connection cuts in and out within just 10 feet or so, and forget it if you go around a corner without the connecting device.

Connection and reconnecting is also very finicky. Sometimes it's fine sometimes it's nearly impossible to get reconnection without powering off and letting it sit disconnected for some time and then retry.

As far as charges...well the first few times the charge was fine and satisfied but then after about 3 charges the performance was horrible not lasting more than 20 minutes but only on one of the earbuds...this after having a full charge.

The earbuds tend to fall out regularly and regardless of the size of ear piece that is used, forget trying to jog when just walking a bit will jar loose and fallout.

Not impressed at all with this product. I'm out 50.00 now perhaps save your money for a better product.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing value for the price! Great quality product,"This is an amazing value pair of earbuds. Of course AirPods have taken the world by storm but I’m not the type to want to pay that kind of money so when I saw these I had to give them a try. Man was it worth the purchase.

They stay put very nicely, just make sure you look at the directions how to correctly place them in your ear. They pair super easily and the battery life is pretty good. Sounds quality is very clear, really nice low ends with these.

The only downside is, I wish you were able to do more with the touch functions on the earbuds themselves but for the price I can definitely overlook that.

If you are in the market for lesser expensive earbuds but still want quality, I would definitely recommend considering these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Truly wireless without breaking the bank.,"The T10 Earbuds connected easily to my phone. The audio for music sounds great and my wife said the call quaity was real good. It may just be a matter of getting used to the Earbuds, but when using them on a phone call while the rest of my house slept, the caller could not hear me when I tried to speak quietly to avoid waking others up...
The charging thru the case is simple and I was thrilled that they case can be charged wirelessly! Nice touch.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Battery and Noice cancellation,"The sound quality is great. Gives you a good sound bass. The noise cancellation is also great. The only thing I don’t like is when I’m sweating heavily or running, the ear plugs tend to pop out of my ear. Every other minute I have to push them back in. The battery charger is great as well. Chargers them in about 30 min and lasts 1.5 hrs all during my workout. Great product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great little buds!,"Good sound quality for music/voice. My husband said he could hear me fine talking to him on the phone (and he is somewhat hard of hearing). For the price, I was really impressed with the musical quality. I use them when exercising. I'm having trouble keeping the right one seated in my ear, so I may need to put a smaller rubber ear bud on it, but the left starts comfortable in place. I haven't used them over a long period, so I can't speak to battery life yet. They paired easily with my Note 8. I would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Bang for your Buck,"Summary:
To get a Bluetooth set like this with decent sound quality, good battery life and the IPX8 rating for less than $50 is an amazing deal.

Detailed summary:
So far I am happy with this purchase.  The sound quality is impressive, better than I expected in terms of bass which is usually hard to produce in these types of earphones.  I tested in the shower once and so far they have not failed so I am assuming the IPX8 rating is legitimate.
The range is as listed, it is average but does tend to cut out a bit earlier than my previous pair of Bluetooth earphones.  I can't give a negative review because they are listed at a range of about 30ft and I would say that has proven to be true, but this must be an open 30ft, no doors or walls or the effective distance will go down.

They are about average for staying power in your ear.  This can be very subjective as all our ears are different shapes and sizes and we have different experiences.  I tried to use the next size large circular piece of the earphone but it was too big so I had to stick with the standard size which works fairly well.  They will come loose in my ear if I bump my ear or slightly hit the earphone is some way or don't seat them well initially and then will fall out so I will need to re-seat them in my ear.  In general I find that if you insert and lock them as instructed they will stay in place for exercise or running it is just when you bump them or just over time they will come slighly loose.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

BEST WIRELESS HEADPHONES & Customer Service,"I have been looking for a great wireless pair of headphones for a long time now. These popped up in my last search around my price range and I couldn't help but notice the 9,000+ positive reviews on them. Since I have had them I have worn them every day and used them for something. The sound is great, charging case is convenient and lasts long, and the microphone works on phone calls phenomenally. What's even better is the customer service. When you open the box there is a sheet of paper with instructions on claiming the FREE one year warranty (Make sure you do this right away it takes literally 1 minute to set up).

Great value. Even better sound.,"I've been eying earbuds for sometime now, and had settled on the BOSE SoundSport Free Wireless Headphones. These were way out of my price range, however, so I did a bit of research and discovered these Toyo. It was hard to find a negative comment about them.

5 stars is simply not enough for these earbuds....,"What can I say. After watching countless YouTube videos, my inner audiophile-self decided to splurge.

I have them all: Bose, dre beats, jaybird, etc. The only ones that came close to topping/being of equal level to my Bose earbuds were these. There is a great amount of base in these guys! They get super loud and you can hear the song the way it's meant to be heard. Also, these are extremely comfortable.

Great pair of completely wireless headphones,"Received the headphones the day after ordering, so that was great. Sound quality, ease of use, setup, and wireless charging is excellent. I've been using them all day and the battery is still going strong. My only complaint is that I'm walking and my phone is in my pocket, it seems that the reception cuts in and out. Not sure if it's just they pair that I received or if the Bluetooth connection just isn't very strong. I don't have that issue with other headphones, so I'm taking one star away for it. That said, when my phone is out of my pocket I haven't had any issues with the BT cutting in/out.

Impressive.,"I was a bit concerned dropping nearly $50 on a pair of wireless earbuds. But, these things have surprised me. The sound is great. I had them turned up fairly loud playing a bass filled song and my daughter said she couldnt hear anything. I could see her mouth flapping away and never heard a word she said either.

The charging case seems pretty rugged
 It is just plastic but in the hand it feels durable enough. Its thicker than most I've seen on here. I'm pleased with it. Although, I wish it weren't plastic. Maybe aluminum or something else. It is what it is.

"Good product, but lacking to be a great product.","So far, the earbuds are great. They sound phenomenal, fit well, and stay where you put them once you find the rubber tip that fits your ear correctly. HOWEVER, as some have experienced, I am finding that the left earbud cuts in and out frequently. When it does this, my phone is less than 18” from my head. The other aggravating thing is that it is random, and about the time I go to turn the buds off and back on, it quits.

Having sound issues,Seems well made. Nice case. Seems very durable. Having issues with the left channel cutting in and out. Its been this way since the first use. Thought maybe i didnt sinc them correctly or i had a phone or setting issue but nothing seems to help. Sound quality is great but im disappointed with the connection issues.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Game changer!!,"Product works well. Easily paired and so very convenient to use. I love the ability to use the right earbud while leaving the other in the case. Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Really good earbuds,"These earbuds are great, better than the Samsung Buds, they connected instantly to my Galaxy Note10+ with no hassle. It's so easy to drop the buds in the case and drop them on the wireless charger. Highly recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TL; DR. They're cheap with lots of flaws. But they're cheap.,"I already own a pair of Jabra Elite Active 65t true wireless earbuds but... I stupidly left them at home for a long trip abroad and ended up buying these on Amazon as cheap temporary replacements. Definitely no chance of them being more than that.

Cons:
- Biggest flaw: Buds are a bit bulky shapewise (not so much weightwise). They don't sit securely in the ear, and I have had them come off quite easily despite trying the different silicone tips and twisting them in at whatever possible angle. This is a big issue with wireless buds that would make them so much easier to lose.
- Sound is mediocre. The seal because of the unsecure fit already leaks in quite a bit of external  noise which doesn't help. They can get quite loud but then you can really hear where it suffers in terms of overall tinny sound, poor extension on both ends, and muddied separation. They're ok, I guess for podcasts and dialogue-driven content but not general music listening or shows/movies with lots of dynamic range.
- The buttons right on each earbud are terribly hard to press. You end up jamming the pods into your ear to increase volume or switch songs. I end up just using controls on my phone.
- No auto pause when you take either earbud out.

Pros:
- Being able to wirelessly charge the case is a nifty feature. Works on any Qi charging mat + my Galaxy S10e's wireless powershare feature.
- Pairing was pretty easy and mostly consistent. Link was also pretty OK but haven't tried walking more than 8 feet from the signal source or into separate rooms.
- Cheap. For the price I paid, I wasn't expecting them to permanently replace my Jabra 65ts, but I can't escape the feeling I could have found better deals (e.g. not as cheap but with better fit, design, or sound quality) if I shopped around more.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality for inexpensive Bluetooth headphones,"Just got my TOZO T10 earbuds and got to play with them this past weekend on both my IPad and Phone. So far I’ve enjoyed them very much.

- Extremely easy to connect Bluetooth to my devices.
- Sound quality is actually pretty impressive
- I really do enjoy the charging case. Makes it very convenient when I’m carrying them around and it keeps them fully charged throughout the day.

Def recommend getting them if your looking some something inexpensive with great quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worst Bluetooth I've ever owned,"Right off the bat people said they couldn't hear me - no matter how loud I turned up the volume, they couldn't hear me and/or couldn't understand me. Then the left earpiece just went out. I turned my phone on and off, just in case it was the phone. Still couldn't hear out of the left ear piece. The instructions say to choose the ear cap size that fits your ear. What??? There's only one ear cap in the box! According to the instructions they have S, M, L & XL, but the different sizes aren't included in my box. So there I am working out and pop! The right ear bud bounces out of my ear. Basically they're not what is advertised. Do not purchase.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great customer service and headphones!,"I love these headphones! The color is sleek and the sound is great. Easy to work with and much more affordable than air-pods. I also lost the charging case in an uber and the same day Sophia from their customer service got back to me and started to arrange my replacement, life saver!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great when they work, but...","The pair I got CONSTANTLY dropped the left earbud every 5-10 seconds.  This drove me crazy while I mowed my lawn and, after much testing, I think I figured out what the problem was - my friggin' arm! Every time my arm blocked the connection between my Galaxy S9 and the earbud (an overall distance of maybe 2 feet), it would cut out for 1 to 2 seconds.  It got really annoying really fast.  A cheaper pair I had given to my wife NEVER had this problem.  Remaining thoughts:

Pros:
-- The case is cool, charging is nice, the wireless feature was nice as well, although I did not test this thoroughly.
-- The sound quality is awesome.

Cons:
-- Aside from above, these things took 20 seconds to connect to a previously paired phone.  All my other Bluetooth devices take MAX 5 seconds to connect.

-- Other pairs I had before, I could use one ear and leave the other in the case.  These beep every 10 seconds until I take the other bud out of the case.  This made these earbuds horrible for my work, where I can only wear one bud in for safety reasons.

-- The amount of pressure required to press the button on the buds is MUCH higher than previous buds I've used.  It was really uncomfortable, having to shove the buds FURTHER into my ear just to pause/resume the music.

-- Not being able to reprogram the long/double button press actions without software overrides on my phone.  I didn't like that double-press was redial the last number that called me, the long press was something equally useless.  Other buds would either advance a track or go to previous track depending on which bud was double-pressed.

In short, I hope I had a defective set of buds, but when compounded with the other annoyances I experienced, I am returning these for a different set.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Broken in 3 months,"After 3 months the drivers are so weak I can't even hear my podcasts.  Also has this obnoxious feature where it keeps beeping after it's already paired and playing something.  Better off buying a $10 pair every month, more cost effective.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product with Quality Sound & Design,"I was certainly impressed with the base sound quality not to mention most of other noises were gone as soon as I put these earbuds on. The Passive noise canceling design from these earbuds are amazing great.
For the most use, I just had the volume setting on the lowest, and it was already loud and crystal clear.

Blue tooth pairing, connecting, and disconnecting were all simple and quick.

Battery lasts about 4 hours at low volume setting. With the charging case, there's no need to even worry about the running out of juice through out the day. Design of the case and earbuds themselves are solid and sleek. The charging case is capable to charge with Qi wireless charger (just FYI if wireless charging is one of the user experience you're looking for). The charging case is compacted, so fits pockets quite nicely and still leaves enough room for phone or wallet.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"So small and comfortable , I can fall asleep with them",Best wireless earbuds I’ve ever owned. My wife watches TV and used to keep me awake. But not now! Other BT earbuds are too big to sleep with.

Much better than the other brands,"My kids purchased two other brands and they worked ok.  A pain in the neck trying to get the two ear buds to link.

I purchased these Tozo T10 for myself and I am very glad I did. They were not much more money since headphones are cheap.  But the setup was all automated and the sounds is great.  I had surgery on one of my ears so I was afraid these would not work.  But with the many ear pieces they supply, one of the sizes worked.

I did not expect to be so happy for the price.  Great price and great quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds!!!,"I received my Tozo T10 earbuds about a week ago and they are fantastic! They stay in place even at night (I listen to music) and the sound quality is exceptional!

I thoroughly enjoy them, and think for the price they are just perfect!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great price point and quality product!,I’ve only had these earbuds for a couple days but I’m loving them so far.  I’m very active and use my earbuds a lot when I’m working out. It was important to find a product that would stay in my ear while doing physical activity. These are working great. They also come with 4 different size caps that can adjust to the size of your ear. I love that they are water resistant. A common problem I have is that I usually have to replace my headphones/earbuds bc they break bc of the sweat from working out. The price point and quality of this product has been perfect!  I’ll continue to use these earbuds and post updates! Looking forward to future workouts!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent earbuds at an excellent price point,"Straight out of the box these headphones were very easy to pair to my phone and fit to my ears. Im very impressed with the sound quality, especially for the price point. My favorite feature is how they are waterproof. Being able to wear earbuds in the shower is an awesome experience!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Actually Fantastic,"You know, for such a low price, I didn't expect much out of these tiny little earbuds. However, I was completely blown away by the quality. They fit my ears perfectly, and even came with different sized buds just in case. I mainly use them to go running around my college campus, and never once have they gotten loose or fallen out from me jumping and landing. The one thing I haven't tried is using them in the rain or in the shower, but I'm sure the water proofing would work as intended. The sound quality is great, but I think the only downside is the short listen time. My commute over the summer was 4 hours round trip, so I had to charge them during the day unfortunately. Again though, you can't ask for much more for such a low price. Great product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My search for earbuds are over,"After having these just one day, I can already see how the Tozo outranks my prior Bluetooth earbuds. Pairing was simple and the sound quality is amazing. I am getting about 3 1/2 hours of continuous listening. While I do not have plans to use these in the water, it is nice to know that if by chance they fall and get wet, I won’t have to worry.

To back their claim, when I opened my box, I saw a registration card for a 1-year limited warranty. When you stand behind your product, you know it will be excellent quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best True Wireless Earbuds for the Price,"i’ve been looking for true wireless earbuds for a few months now. I am an iPhone user so at first i considered AirPods - but who wants to spend close to $200 for earbuds that aren’t even noise cancelling?
Anyways, I found these based on the good reviews and decided to try them. I am very impressed and would recommend these to anyone. They are truly noise cancelling and waterproof. they synced up to my phone so quick. The only thing i didn’t like at first is if you double click it doesn’t skip the song, it redials. But I quickly got over this - I listen to podcasts mostly.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and would buy again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Sound at a Fraction of the Cost and sold by a reliable company,"These headphones are great.  I have to say I was a bit surprised with just how good the sound quality and the bass are.  I use these everyday for roughly 2 hours a day and I could not be more pleased.

Equally important is how the company TOZO stands behind their products.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones or earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I shouldve just bought another set of convenience store brand BT earbuds than these.,"Im coming from a cheap convenience store brand bluetooth earbuds that i bought in an emergency when my wired earbuds died and those just had a constantly little electric buzz but they were ok and got the job done. So when those cheap ones died, i thought for 30 bucks more, these would sound better but no, the sound quality is arguably worse than the convenience store brand. For example, i tried listening to Mozart's ""Gran Partita"" and there is supposed to be a smooth swell in the beginning but it just sounded all crackely and horrific, like ur at an orchastra but theres a section that is playing along with newspaper, styrofoam, and forks on a chalk board.

Idk if its just my unit, but this sucks.

Only thing good about this is battery life. The case is very convenient and the earbuds themselves fit well in my ear. Shame it the audio quality is horrific.

I guess these are for podcasts and audiobooks only because I cant stand music on these things.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Very Secure, Great Sound--Update! Returned","I bought these for working out and was worried due to the design they would not be secure. They are, very. Sound is great, they seal out a good deal of ambient noise, they connect immediately out of the case. I haven't worn them for more than 2 hours so I can't attest to the 3 hr battery life but these are a great, mid priced bluetooth earbud no question I would reccommend them.
Update: 7/18. I noticed the left earbud would start to cut out, especially during movement. This problem got worse and worse over the weeks, to where the earbuds were unusable. Returned, sadly.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Work As Advertised,"The battery life is quite good. I got 3 hours or so using them at a decent volume on one charge. They fit into my ears and don't fall out.

I was also able to play music from my computer to my headphones when I was in a different room without them disconnecting. The bass on the headphones is pretty good.

Sound quality exceeds expectations,"I received these for Father's Day and had no idea what to expect.  When I first tried them the first impression was an overemphasis on base.

Listen to higher quality streaming and you'll be amazed at the wonderful, full spectrum of sound including clear, crisp highs.  The sound produced is exceptional for the price point and I do recommend you give them a try!  They will grow on you.

I want to also mention that these have great build quality -- again exceptional for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for keeping your hands free!,"Great for listening to music or watching something on our ipad when you need to be quiet.

I don't really think they were worth the price.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Must have both earbuds in or at least on your person!,"This is a decent set of earbuds for the price.  Good value compared to the $200 sets.  I like the sound quality,  the price, and the fit.  Now on to the dealbreaker. I usually only wear the right earbud while I'm working because I need to hear what's going on around me.  With my last pair of bluetooth earbuds, they were connected together with a wire. I ran it through the top button on my shirt and the left earbud went into my left shirt pocket. With this truly wireless pair,  I can't leave the left one just rolling around in a pocket unconnected to anything.  It will eventually fall out somewhere and disappear.  What I've tried to do is just pick up and use the right one and leave the left one in the case.  The right one beeps at me every 2 -3 seconds until I connect the left one.  If I put it back in the case,  the beeping starts... if I walk out of range of the left,  the beeping starts.  Nothing I do short of connecting the left and leaving it rolling around in a pocket on my person stops this beeping. It makes this pair unusable for me and it's very frustrating.  This can't be such a rare scenario that no one would think of a way around it.  One idea would be to have a way to shut off the beeping with a button push or by leaving the left one off altogether.  This pair will probably get passed on to someone else who doesn't mind having both in all the time.  Other than the flaw with this particular scenario,  they are a good pair.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphone set for the price,"Been loving these Bluetooth earbuds for when I go to the gym and don't want to worry about any wires.

So far so good...,"This review is a work in progress.

1st impression (6/14/2019):  It looks great.  Case seem more compact than initially thought which is good.  The earphones fit quite secure in my ears, which I was surprised with.  My ears are very small.  Tried head banging and spinning violently.  Pieces stayed secure in my ear.  I only had couple of minutes to observe sound quality.  Bass seemed good with good kick.  Highs seemed clear.  I will cover more on that later after longer use.  Haven't had it long enough to cover battery life or build quality although it seems to be built solid from initial look and fill.  BTW, my son has the new Airpod 2 which he purchased yesterday from the Apple store, which I got to try out, and I really didn't like the sound quality of it.  So far, I am very happy with the purchase of T10.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's about time!! These are fantastic,"I have been wanting a pair of wireless for the gym that actually fit and stay in my ears with NOTHING going around my ears to hold it in place.

Useless microphone and Bluetooth connection issues,The built in microphone is a disaster. People could barely hear me when I used them for calls and I actually had to take out and hold one of the pieces closer to my mouth in order to be heard at all. As other people mentioned in some of the reviews the connection between the speakers is really bad. After some use the left piece goes into an annoying cycle of disconnecting-reconnecting especially when you move your head and you have to keep resetting them in order to fix that. Whether I got a defective one or all of their products are like this I don’t know. But it seems like it’s a common issue so I’m not going to replace it and hope that the new one I get will be different. Sound quality is good and battery life is okay hence the two stars but I wouldn’t recommend this product. I wish they didn’t put that useless microphone in there and focused more on the connection strength and overall quality.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Minor audio issues,"These are pretty good headphones, there are some.minor connection issues (sound drops on the left audio channel while in use) and sometimes pairing the left and right is a little wonky.

"Solid earbuds, but a couple glaring problems.","The sound quality is pretty solid - better than I expected. Deep bass and clear treble. The tips that were on the headphones already fit me perfectly.

HOWEVER

Every time I look up for more than 2 seconds, the left audio bud cuts out. My phone is in my pocket, so it's not out of range or anything.

Also, the tips fell off and got stuck in my ear twice. I am concerned by that. I was able to get them out each time with my fingers, but still...

I normally use just one at a time, so battery life hasn't been an issue.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"When they work, they're ok.","I thought it was just my older mac, but ANYTHING I try to pair these too has drop out issues. The earbuds constantly (every 2-8 minutes) lose sound for about 1-3 seconds. There is no pairing error, they just go silent and then start up again.

Battery life is mediocre. I get about 2.5 - 3.5 hrs of listen time before they die. Have not gotten any longer than 3.5hrs no matter how long they are charged.

Over all sound quality is good for what you are paying, when it's playing sound. The times they go dead, obviously, the sound stinks. They are not noise cancelling. They just fit so tight they muffle out external sounds. Noise cancelling is a tech that reads ambient sound and cancels that out, these DO NOT cancel out noise.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So-so earbuds (and pathetic tactics to get 5-star reviews),"This is my second set of bluetooth earbuds. The sound quality in the TOZO T10 Bluetooth is quite good, better than in my other set. The bad: The connection gets broken if I turn my head sometimes or if I move my phone. That never happened with my other set. Also the battery seems to be very small and holds very few charges.

But what I liked the least about the TOZO T10 is that after I purchased them I started getting emails from the seller offering me a wireless charger if I gave them a 5-star review (I was to send them proof that I had sent a review). That is so pathetic! I imagine that a lot of people took them up on the offer because there are so many 5-star reviews, but I don't think that should be allowed at Amazon.

"Wish I could return, but I waited too long",I’m a pretty picky headphone person but had high hopes for these based on the reviews. Sound quality is good except for when they are occasionally staticky and cut in and out. My biggest issue is that the body part of the headphone is so big and bulky that they do not stay easily in ears.

They work Great,"I purchased these last week and I am very pleased with my experience so far. At first I was a bit annoyed because they kept falling out of my ears, but then I found the other bud sizes that come with it. I ended up needing the smallest size.

The best buds for $50,"I researched extensively before purchasing the TOZO T10. I mainly was concerned about being waterproof and whether they would fall out.

The earphone piece is very big and bulky. I have tried a few others that are smaller and stay in good. So if you are very active, don't get these.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Design Flaw - Won't Stay in Ears,"These headphones are very cool. The case looks nice, very cool concept. However, there is a design flaw. They have nothing that keeps them in your ears. I've tried every single rubber size for the in-ear piece. That piece in itself isn't sufficient to keep them in. They would fall out when I was walking or anything similar.
These type of headphones need a piece that secures them, and it doesn't have it.
Also, sound quality isn't good at all. I have another cheap pair from a different brand that sounds way better.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Earbuds at a Great Price.,"The sound quality is outstanding. Probably the best of any buds I have owned (5) for music and podcasts. Also, people I talk to on the phone say the call quality is the best I have ever had.
Very good battery life. The buds charge quickly, as does the charging case.
I have only three complaints, and two of them are just minor annoyances.
1. (just an annoyance) The ""low battery"" alarm only occurs about one minute before the bud goes dead. A little more warning would be appreciated.
2. (just an annoyance) There is no app. An app would be useful to monitor battery usage and a few other things.
3. (Almost a show stopper) There is no way to invoke the Google Assistant (or Siri, I guess) from the buds. I keep my phone locked when not in use. I can use the ""Hey Google"" command for some requests, but many of them return with ""you must unlock your phone in order to do this"". On all previous earbuds, I would long press the bud, and that would invoke the assistant right to command mode, even while the phone was locked.

But overall they are great, and I am keeping them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The sound quality is really great,"I love these because they have amped up the bass, which I love. The battery lasts a really long time, they are very comfortable and they connected to my phone and iPad instantly. Great value and great customer service.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Finally Decent Sound and Excellent Price,"I tried a few of these more reasonably priced wireless earbuds before landing on the TOZO 10's. While I haven't had them very long, the initial impression is great! I would suggest following their recommendation to try ALL of the various-sized ear pieces to ensure you have the best fit. I liked the fit and feel of the original mounted size, until I tried the smallest set. The sound went up a notch as they settled into the proper position within the ear and the noise cancellation became great. Even at a low volume I have to take a bud out to hear someone talking 3' away...impressive. I can't wait to use these on my next flight.

Pros:
- Syncing was effortless
- Good base for earbuds
- Nice sound (when proper size is selected)
- Hold a charge well
- Noise cancellation is really good
- Either bud can be the master, allowing for single bud use

I'll try to circle back and update this review after a few months of use.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really nice sound.,I really like these ear buds. The only issue I have with them is the fit. The small bud size is too small and the medium is too large but I make it work. I can't imagine the # of different sizes they would have to make in order for you to find the one that fits perfectly.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
My favorite pair of bluetooth earbuds hands down,"I've tried a number of different bluetooth earbuds and the sound quality of my previous purchases were just so-so. The sound quality is great during workouts, because it helps cancel some of the surrounding noises at the gym. Plus they are sweatproof/waterproof.  I also love the fact that there are 4 different sized silicone ear pads that allow you to find the one that fits just right. I would definitely recommend getting these earbuds to others.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Comfortable, Good sound","This product works very well, but sometimes slips a little due to sweat (but has not fallen out, even while running). The only thing about the sound is it cuts out every once in a while for a split second and then comes back. I'm not sure if that is due to faulty mechanical issues as it seems to do it when it's fully charged also.

Otherwise, the sound is pretty great and blocks most outside sounds. Base is great. They connect well to eachother and to bluetooth devices, no connectivity issues.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Purchased in lieu of spending money on airpods,I did not like how tight they felt in my ear.  Sound quality was good but they kept coming out while I was walking and fit uncomfortably in my ears.  Ended up buying the airpods.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding wireless ear buds,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Aren’t that great at staying in ears,"I’ve tried all the sizes provided but these headbuds stoll dont snugly stay in my ear all the time. They’ve fallen out of my ears several time and I’ve almost lost them that way. Besides that, the lack of controls this has kinda makes it second class to other wireless earbuds (can’t even skip a song with these things). I might just end up returning these.

UPDATE: after 2 months the left earbud no longer functions. I’d go with another pair. Also if you have trouble connecting these to a receiver/transmitter then you got to start the pairing process on both",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them,Ok so I did my research on trying to find a good bluetooth and when I came across these I knew it was the one lol. Waterproof I havent test that out yet. It is durable and the battery life is amazing. I have had them about 2 weeks now and I've charged it about 3 times that's it. I love the bass and when I speak to people while driving there hasn't been the complaint that they cant hear me. This was a great buy.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THE BEST EAR BUDS FOR THE MONEY,"These are by FAR THE BEST ear buds I have purchased!  I have used them daily, and they work great, hold their charge, and do NOT COME OUT!!!!  I have purchased corded earbuds, and blue tooth earbuds...about 5 pairs.  These have great sound quality, crisp and clear.  No interrupted play.  I wear them to workout and to mow my yard.  They shipped fast!  Were easy to pair with my device.  Best purchase I have made!!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Option for Wireless Earphones!,"I was kind of skeptical that these would live up to their high review levels, but I must say I am impressed!  The pairing process was easy, and the fit and finish are good.  The sound quality was better than I thought it would be. Good bass and sound stage.  Treble can be a little bright or harsh at times, but not enough to be a significant detriment.  I like the smoked glass cover on the case so you can see the charging lights.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Very Impressed, improved on last design ALOT","Last year I purchased this same product but the generation before (cant remember what they are called, but the ones before the T10) and they absolutely sucked. Wouldn't pair to my phone after just a few days of use and the sound quality was nothing impressive. I was very weary about giving this company a second chance, but boy have they redeemed themselves. These are the best pair of wireless headphones i've ever used. Perfect for working out. They never fall out, sound is good, and the charging system received a MASSIVE update. WOW! Everything is magnetic on the charging case rather than spring loaded so its super satisfying to pop open the case and shut it. Not only that, but the actual headphones are held snugly in their charging ports via magnets. All you have to do is hover the headphones above their little slot in the case and they pop right into place effortlessly. I am very impressed with the quality of these headphones and I am very glad I decided to give this company another chance.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth every penny,Buy it!  Worth it I have Bose noise canceling headphones and these come close for the price they go well above my expectations.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I would give these 10 stars if I could,"I have been trying many different brands of ear buds with little satisfaction. I received these and the minute I turned them on, I was hooked. I love the many different sizes of ear caps. I have very small ears and the smallest size fits perfectly. The sounds is also fantastic, I have a very loud, obnoxious co-worker and when I'm wearing the ear buds, it's like she isn't even there. I love that they are wireless and begin to pair with my phone as soon as I take them out of the base. Also the confirmation that both sides have been connected leaves out any doubt. Phone calls are easy to answer and very clear. The carrying case is very durable and the small size makes it easy to slip into a bag or pocket for on-the-go. The shipping box and packaging are also very impressive. Also, they were charged when I received them so I could use them right away. I have to say again how pleased I am with the different sized ear caps.. Probably my favorite feature. They don't fall out of my hears and I don't have to shove them in & hurt my ear.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The greatest Earbuds that I have ever used,"I prefer these earbuds over AirPods for many reasons: they are waterproof, excellent sound quality, sound doesn't ""bleed through"" so that others can hear your music, and they have buds which allows them to actually fit comfortably in my ears. I use them all the time, especially in the shower and they work great. Thanks for this amazing product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality earbuds with ever greater quality sound,"I was kind of skeptical purchasing these earbuds never hearing of this brand. Though seeing that these were Amazon choice product and seeing the reviews, I thought it wouldn't hurt. I got the earbuds and where fully charged connected to my my android phone without any issues. Music quality from these earbuds are nice and clear bass is great also. I am was very surprised by the quality of the product and sound.  You have the option to connect either or both earbuds. The buds come with two other size silicone ear cap with the ones already attached to the buds. Charging seems to be quick for both the charging case and the buds themselves. I have not tested the waterproofing on them, but seem to be sweat proof when working out and the do not fall out while doing my workouts. I would recommend these to friends and family looking for earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left bud cuts out constantly,"I tried using these at the gym but the constant connection loss and audio issues were infuriating.

Sent them back and got my refund.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Can’t go wrong, quality product!","These wireless earbuds are the first that I’ve tried that DONT fall out and don’t feel uncomfortable. The sound quality is also pretty amazing for less than 50.00 earbuds, I bought these because my beats died on me and now I’m mad I even wasted the extra money on those when these are just as good if not better because they add a little extra bass to the music and I love that!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for value for the price,"This was surprisingly a very good pair of headphones. It has a lot of bass, if you're into a lot of heavy workout music and the sound quality was pretty decent for the price. I can't really think of anything bad to say about them other than the battery life could be longer. It gives you virtually no warning before the battery dies completely and your headphones are rendered useless, but as long as you have the case handy it won't be that big of an issue. The case supports wireless charging so that's cool too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bluetooth headphones.,Headphones are well made and last a long time. I have small ears and the small ear buds work well. They also have medium and large.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sleek, High-Quality, and High Value!","I have tried so so many of these earbuds. I went through maybe 5-6 attempts at finding a good, reliable true wireless earbud combo for a while, but they all were patchy or flawed. I gave up for a bit, figuring the technology just had to catch up. Now it has!

This is the first quality pair of true wireless earbuds I have come across, and at a fraction of the cost of airpods! They connect incredibly easily--they come with instructions, but honestly any average user won't even need them. They are sleek, barely sticking out of your ear. They have pretty decent sound quality too! If you're an audiophile, you may notice slight muddiness in the sound, but for a pair of wireless earbuds these are top notch for the size and cost. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good! And the included size adjustment cups are a great way to ensure that.

Finally, they really shine when working out. There is no feeling better than being able to have no wires entangling you or holding you back while running, lifting, or walking. Truly a great experience.

Overall, I'm happy to highly recommend these. If you're looking for your first pair of wireless earbuds, or maybe looking for an upgrade from other earbuds, this is the product for you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Fits multiple ear sizes!,"My ears are small and traditional earphone/ buds just do not fit.  With something so small and compact, it needs to fit reliably to replace my other headset.

So far, so good!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10 Lives up to it advertisement!,"I ran across the the TOZO T10 by accident and I am glad I did. I was looking for something wireless, water proof and something that would stay in my ears under intense physical exercise, work or anything else. They have lived up to and exceeded my expectations as long as you take the time to put the right rubber piece to go into your ears. I was having trouble with the left side not properly sinking with the right side, and their customer service has been excellent in getting this issue resolved. I would recommend these to anyone, from the most serious athlete or for your part time gardening activities. Battery life is adequate but could be improved for extended use, however the charging unit works fast and is convenient!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, portability, battery life, size, comfort BUT NOT GREAT CONNECTIVITY","These are some pretty solid earbuds for the cost. As with most earbuds, they're pretty good at cancelling sound; and that sound, the quality of it, is pretty great. I'm no audiophile but I enjoyed just about every little part of the noise coming into my ears. I don't believe anything was enhanced at the cost of another; every instrument got in the spotlight with these.

Also, extremely portable too. Fantastically portable. Tiny little box, no bigger than a cigarette box (smaller). Easily fit in a coat pocket or any pocket really. Magnets in the earbuds make attaching them to charge a quick ordeal, and the lid is magnetically closed too. Very durable.

What I don't like about these is that the signal is very easily blocked. Like, REALLY easy. As much as turning my head a different way sometimes would cut out the signal completely, even if the phone was in my shirt pocket, 4 inches from my face. I don't know why exactly it happens, but it happened an awful lot. Just for that reason, I would recommend you steer towards something that has a single, more reliable bluetooth reciever opposed to two less-reliable ones. My Skullcandy bluetooth headphones are somehow able to pass through just about anything while these started fussing as soon as I raised as much as an arm conveniently in the way.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Did not last 3 months. With little use,"Worked great at first, but now consistently cuts in and out while wearing.  Only used these on about 10 different occasions, mainly while jogging.
It's a shame too, because the sound quality and comfort was actually really good.  I bragged about them to everyone, but now they are basically a paper weight.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value and quality,"The audio is good for totally wireless earbuds. It’s fine for music. The mids are a bit low and the bass is punched up. I wouldn’t use these for audio editing but for any other application these will be plenty fine. It does make the sound feel a little cold right now.

I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you listen to a lot of spoken word - like podcasts. The treble is way too sharp. I hear every single ""S"" sound. The sound bites and there's no way to dial it down.

I found these headphones to be really comfortable but YMMV since not all ear canals are the same. I was able to use the plugs that pre-installed but there were other sizes in the box. When putting them on, the instructions started to rotate the buds. That really helped lock the headphones in compared to some other ones I’ve tried. I have only worn them while on the bike and walking. Neither activity caused the headphones to shift.

I like that the charger case is also supposedly IPX8. I haven’t submerged the case yet but it’s nice to know that it’ll be easier to clean. The cover for the USB port is hard to open but I suspect that’s to help prevent water intrusion. The one minor issue I have with the case is the USB port. It’s fairly inset. The port is also small so most of my existing USB cables won’t work. Otherwise I’m quite fond of the use of magnets in the case and headphones. The ear buds drop in to the case with a snap as well as closing the case cover.

I have used these daily for the last week. I’m pretty happy. I’m looking forward to breaking in the earbuds completely hoping that it’ll warm up the sound.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
DO NOT BUY FOR IPHONE,"There is no chance the other reviews are legitimate if they are using iPhone. These earbuds sound fine like any other ear buds of this price however I have tried to listen music for the past 2 hours and have yet to complete a single song without one of the ear buds cutting out multiple times, its beyond obnoxious. I will be returning these and just shelling out the money for AirPods this is very disappointing, I would rate 1 star if the sound wasn't decent but at least they have the going for them(when the sound actually comes through)",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Quality,"These earbuds are excellent quality for the price. They sound great, are comfortable, and the battery lasts for a really long time.

As a student, I really appreciate their ability to block out noises while I study. They also stay in my ears when I'm working out, which is a big plus. Overall, I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for inexpensive, solid-quality earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really high quality especially for the affordable price.,"I've owned these for about 3 weeks and have been using then almost daily. The fitting fits quiet nicely and I have had no issues with it falling out (except when I accidentally touch/hit it. They are the perfect weight and is not too heavy not overly light.

I was genuinely surprised by the great sound quality especially for a fully wireless earphone. Volume can get pretty loud so do not worry about it being too quiet.

The few minuses in my experience (which are kind of just ramblings) is that the battery life is about 4-5 hours which is fine but longer would obviously be better. The 2nd minor complaint is that it can only be used with both buds removed from the case, so you cannot only listen with 1 on. I just put one on and put the other one near the case when I want to listen 1 eared.

Pros:
1) Sound Quality
2) Price
3) Fitting / Weight

Cons
1) battery life can be longer (but might increase weight)
2) must listen with both buds connected and can't have only 1 on at a time.

Excellent quality,I was impressed with the quality of sound coming from the Torzo T10 earbuds. I really like the video demonstration ease of use. Never had that before. I’ve had other earbuds and the quality wasn’t there. They fit very comfortably in my ear. The battery usage life far longer than other bud I’ve had in the past.

Not great for use during physical exercise,Sound quality is great....battery life satisfactory...but doesnt work well when using during exercising which is why I got them. Tried the different size ear buds. One of them works pretty well in my left ear but none of the options work very well in the left ear. Both will fall oit while jogging fairly quickly and eventually fall out while walking. Left does a little better than right. For me they only are consistent if using while sitting or maybe on stationary bike or something.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great battery life,The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that you cannot go very far from the device your using. If i walk across my living room the sounds starts to come in and out.

Has pairing issues,"They have decent sound and ok bass. They fit well, even while working out. The battery life is ok. I found out that you have to turn them off before putting them back in the case or it will drain the case battery.

Good for the Price,"I’ve never had Bluetooth headphones until I bought these ones.  I bought a watch and needed Bluetooth headphones for it.  It was hard finding a decent pair at an affordable price especially not knowing if the earbuds are going to be comfortable in your ears.  I don’t like at first that they are a little bulky, but you get used to it.  I only use one earbud at a time when I go running, so if you only turn one earbud on it will beep the first couple of minutes (very quietly and not constantly the first couple of minutes) because it wants to pair with the earbud.  The earbud stays in place pretty good, especially if you’re running.  I like how it comes with a charging case and haven’t had to charge them that much yet, but I’ve only used them a few times so far.  I’ve only had them for a week now, but the sound is really good.  If you can get over the minor flaws then I think this is a good purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They've been great!,"I rec'd my earbuds a couple of weeks ago and have basically used them non stop since I got them. They came completely charged out of the box. Pairing was a breeze & I've been getting nearly 3hrs per charge. The sound quality has been excellent, whether for podcasts, audio books or music. It takes roughly a hour to charge them and you get 4 charges before you have to charge the entire unit. While I've not gone swimming with them, they do hold up well in with sweat & water. I tried them in the shower and they were excellent in there as well. I do have the occasional issue with only one pairing instead of both, but a quick reset does the trick. The only con I can think of is I can't get more than 10-feet from my phone before they lose signal, but that's easily remedied by not getting too far away. 100% would buy them again & the price point of $50 is a great deal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Do not buy these for phone calls.,"While the convenience and compactness of the charging case were excellent, and the overall sound quality was very good, one of the main reasons I bought these were for calls.

Each earbud lasts for about 4 hours of continual podcast/audiobook.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Definitely best bang for your buck,"I was skeptical as hell about trying these, since I had tried and returned nearly all the $200+ options on the market. But here’s my best breakdown:

Sound Quality: Definitely comparable to the high end options, and better in some cases. I hated the low volume level of the Air Pods, even at full volume they were quite weak. But even the new $250 Beats earbuds sounded way too sparkly in the highs, with no mid or low range. But these are well balanced. And definitely the best volume of any wireless earbuds.

Comfort/Fit: probably the best overall. There are others that feel comfortable at first. But after an hour of use I would feel the need to give my ears a break. So far I have done a 3+ hour session with no issues.

Connectivity: this is big for me, since I am on a lot of phone calls during the week. At first, I was worried because they did cut in and out quickly but frequently. This was the main reason for the 4 star rating. But after pairing again, I haven’t really had any issues and just hope it’ll stay this way because these really are good otherwise.

Battery/Charging: The charging cable for the case is laughably short, but not a huge issue. These seem to have a good battery life with a roughly 3 hour session logged. But the best part is they seem to charge faster than any other options.

Conclusion: I seriously can’t believe I ever tried more expensive ones (including a $350 pair). These are better in a lot of ways. And even then, the areas that maybe aren’t as good are only slightly so compared to the pricey ones. Save yourself the time and money and give these a try for a fraction of the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really Great Volume,"I was pleasantly surprised by these headphones. They paired pretty quickly and easily to my Iphone, and I was acutally kinda shocked by the sound quality. I couldn't tell the difference between these and my wired apple earbuds. Also the volume is pretty nice. I have to keep my phone volume at the first bar always with these because its the perfect volume. These things can get pretty loud too, and they block out the sound. So if you wanna block out your surroundings these earbuds are great for that. Overall I really like these buds, and I like the convenience of its wireless charging capabilities.

Great product minor bug,"I just received my ear buds and love them. The volume is loud enough, I can be heard clearly while talking on the phone. I love the case,  very easy to connect to each other.
The only thing that stopped me from giving this product 5 stars is because they do not auto connect to my phone when I take them out the box. I have to turn my Bluetooth on and off to connect. Every Bluetooth headset I have ever owned automatically connects after the first time even the cheap $5 ones. So that's a little annoying but the cost and everything else makes this a good purchase.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Poor connection quality and short range; Would not recommend,"The sound quality was decent the signal held. However, for me, even the slightest jostle would cause the headphones to lose connection. Basically, I can only use them if I'm sitting still and the phone is resting somewhere. If one or the other is in motion, it cuts in and out. If I walk more than about 5 feet away, I lost signal completely. Given the purpose of bluetooth is to allow for some hands free range, it did not serve the purpose.

As an aside, I've made a seller review as well because they followed up on my last review. Demanded that I take it down and they would offer a refund and replacement pair of headphones to show that they ""stand behind their product"". To be fair, they followed up to see whether I had received the replacement pair. When I confirmed that nothing had been received, radio silence once again. No refund, no replacements and an all around shoddy product.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
best in the market,"first of all, the affordability of this product compared to mainstream earbuds out in the market rn, namely the AirPods from apple, is second to none.

Good while they lasted,Not the best sound quality but they did the job. Not the best fit either. Expected more for the price. Lasted just a couple of months and now one ear bud randomly works.  Would not purchase again.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great fit, great sound, great price,","This was a pleasant surprise. I bought these because normal in earphones don’t fit my ears and fall out often. These are perfect, have a wonderful full sound and are ridiculously affordable!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound. But that's it.,I love the sound quality. However for calls it doesn't work at all. I can't talk on the phone. No one hears me. Also u can't just have ur left earbud on an right off. If ur right is not on then nothing is on. U can just have ur right bud on but that's it. Charging time is good. Just hate that I cant make calls or just have my left bud on while my right is off. If u put the right bud to charge u can't use ur left bud at all!! Poopy.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Guess my ear holes are two different sizes...,"…..as I had to use two different ear pieces to get these to stay in my ears even with just the slightest head movement. Even now, not sure I'd attempt to use these during vigorous exercise, but for sitting at my desk working, etc they are staying in place finally.  The BT connection seems reliable and they sound great.

Update - the seller contacted me and offered to send a replacement pair to try. Not sure if they have made some update or if some slight variation in mfg, but this time the 2nd smallest ear plug options now seem to hold these firmly in place and they sound great.  Thank you to the great folks at Tozo.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Total crap. Waste of money.,These are crap. I’m barely over a month in and I can barely hear anything with them. They make videos and music sound like they’re skipping. The sound is crackly and constantly coming in and out. It’s impossible to follow voice calls or anything else. And my return window just closed so now I’m stuck with this crap.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Uncomfortable, heavy, and poor battery life.","""Amazon's Choice"": gives me the impression these are just overstock items that have reached the end of their life.
Feels VERY VERY deceptive for them to be labelled as anyone who would recommend these over the other competitors who offer much better quality and over-all value.

Amazon would only recommend these if their profit ratio is much higher on selling these over others.
All of the exhange-able ear-bud caps this comes with, have a rigid hard plastic circle ring around them.
It might be to ensure there's a snug fit, however it's hard and uncomfortable and will probably be irritating for most people, like myself.

The battery only lasts two to two and a half hours. Which is very poor in comparison to similarly priced competitor's.
The recharge time feels pretty poor for the battery life as well.

The case was kind of nice, about it really.

The earbuds are kind of bulky, and more importantly fairly heavy for what they are actually. (sounds a bit odd, but they're definitely quite a bit heavier than other brands, for whatever reason.).

I would NOT recommend these at all.
These should be $10-$15ish  at the most in cost -  in some dollar style bin at office max or office depot for a ""back to school section"" or something along those lines.

Curious stocking stuffer or otherwise. Save your money, spend the extra $15-20 for a much much much better value and pair of wireless earbuds. Avoid these. I doubt the batteries will have much of a charge after awhile, so you'd probably have to replace them within a year as well.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value!,"These earphones have exceeded my expectations for sound quality and security. I have now worn them while working, running, biking, lifting and gardening and they have stayed tight in my ears the entire time.
The sound quality is very good. It's not Bose or Shure quality, but it's about Sony level which I consider a little heavy on the bass, but still very good.

The battery life has been exactly as advertised. I only use them in about 1.5 hour increments so the battery life is not an issue for me. The case actually charges the earphones, which I thought was a very cool feature. Highly recommend at this price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buy them!,"Wow! Just wow! I had very little expectations for this product mostly because of the affordability. However, I was blown away by the ease of pairing and the sound quality.

Fantastic Quality Earbuds!,"Purchased these Tozo T10 earbuds after reading so many glowing reviews and I was not disappointed! They are fantastic quality for the price, and truthfully much better audio quality then items I have owned that were significantly higher price points! The build quality is excellent, and they feel very well made and constructed. The fit right out of the box was perfect, but it is nice that you also get additional sizes for fitment. Pairing was incredible simple and I was blown away with the quality of the drivers in this earbuds when I tested them out. Fantastic bass and midrange response and a very immersive feel when listening. The charging / storage case is very nice and I like the magnetic drop in for the earbuds when charging as well as the visual indicator lights that show the current charge status. All in all a really excellent product and value! Going to buy another pair for my wife since I like them so much!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Definitely not waterproof.,"First and most importantly: nothing about these are waterproof. At best resistant. If a company puts waterproof in the title they had best be waterproof or I know all the rest of your product description is a lie. If you get these fully wet they will short and die as mine did. Fortunately I found this out within the return window and did not lose any money.

Updated edit:
The company has great customer service and reached out to replace these headphones. This time they will avoid any contact with water and operations seem seamless. Nice headphones for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Performs Great - Just as Advertized!,"I bought the Tozo T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds with Wireless Charging Case to replace my Samsung Galaxy Buds, because I gave those to my teenage son.  To be honest, my expectations weren't too high because of the extremely reasonable low price point of these wireless earbuds.  Now that I have been using them for a few weeks I must say that I am very pleasantly surprised by these earbuds!  I love that I can charge them either via the micro USB port on the charging case, or via a Qi charger.  I have charged them both ways, and they charge great.  They also have four blue LEDs that communicate clearly how charged the case is (1 LED = not very charged; 4 LEDs = fully charged).  The earbuds themselves fit me just fine with the standard size ear gel that comes fitted to the earbuds.  But in case you have different-sized ears, they come with three other sizes of ear gels.  It also comes with a charging cable, to charge via micro USB.  I like that htey are water resistant, though I haven't challenged that feature yet.  I'm just glad to know that I don't need to worry about them getting a little bit wet.  The sound quality if very good, and they seem to cancel noise quite well.  All things considered I am extremely pleased with the value of these earbuds, and would recommend them to potential buyers.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value!  And manufacture stands behind their products.,"Pods just don't fit comfortably in my ears and I don't like behind ear straps.  i use these for workouts and recently had an issue with one of the buds... after trying to fix the problem with Amazon tech support, manufacture took care of the problem, no questions asked.  Battery life is good, charging case is very good and bluetooth connection is fine as long as I keep my phone in my right pocket. BTW, I have very high end headphones at home and appreciate good quality of sound.  These are for my workouts only and I am quite happy with the quality... especially for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice sound quality but do not stay in my ears while working out,This product has good sound quality and have not had any issues with the battery life so far. The main problem is fit. I switched to the smallest ear piece and while working out they will not stay in my ears doing any jumping type activities like jumping rope or Hiit moves. Continually falling out and having to mess with them disrupting my workouts.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"The earbuds are so easy to use, even an old man can figure it out.","So far there is nothing to dislike.  I've had these for awhile now and the charging is so simple.

I'm having no problems with answering calls as well.  I am very impressed with this product and I'm a cranky old guy who tells it like it is.  Amy in customer service sent a follow-up email as well asking me what I thought...she was very polite.  I believe you will agree with me when you try a pair, they are excellent.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good buds at a fair price,"I have been using these earbuds since June 2019 without any issues.  I alternate them with my Apple earbuds, depending on what I am doing.  They stay in my ears, although this has not been an issue for me with other earbuds. I run outside and get sweaty, and have not had any problems with them staying put.
The sound quality is very good; clean and crisp, and the rubber covers block out significantly more ambient noise than the Apples.  I often wear earbuds all day, and after many hours, I have one ear that may become a little sore from the pressure of the buds, but that's after a lot of hours.
The wireless charging case is handy, and i like that I don't have to plug it in.  The blue lights show the charging statues of the cases, and the red lights on the buds light up when they are charging.
I have not had any issues with Bluetooth pairing, although the way the connection is made to a device is a little funky-  only the R earbud connects to the device, and the R bud connects to the L bud.  I have had 1 or 2 episodes when I have had my R earbud too far away from the connected device, and then I get a slightly out of sync sound from the 2 buds.  I believe it is when the L bud also connects to the device (I think)..  This is easily remedied by either turning them off and on again, or checking which bud(s) are connected under the BT menu on my iPhone.
I have used these with an iPhone 8S and and iPad mini 4.  Considering the price, these are a good option.  Since I have had such good experience with these, I ended up buying another set in white as a present for a family member.  I recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Good Quality,"Overall my expreriance with this product was very good. The sound quality is above average for earbuds, it's easy to use, and the battery lasts longer than you’ll need it to. There was a problem with having both earbuds connected, but it was easily fixable by disconnecting and reconnecting them.
For a person such as myself, who enjoys being outside a lot, it is helpful that they are waterproof. I don’t have to worry about getting them wet when it rains, or if I accidentally drop them.
It is a very good product that I would highly recommend for a fraction of what other wireless earbuds cost.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great pair of bluetooth headphones,"I had written a previous review about how inefficient my last pair were. Tozo reached out to me to, sent me new ones, and they work perfectly.

Bliss In Your Ears,This is a product as good as the brand name items for way less money. I've had no issues with it so far. Its water proof function is excellent.

"Pre-opened packaging, large earbuds, but otherwise decent.","While making this purchase, I believed that I was ordering a new pair of earbuds.  Upon opening the box, that clearly was not the case.  The inner packaging had been torn open, but I can't tell if they had been used previously.  Rather worrisome.

Pros (so far): Relatively easy to connect to my phone.  Sound is decent. Seems to charge quickly.  Charging case lid is see through (so you can see the charging lights).  Regular USB/mini USB charging cable.

Cons (so far): Earbuds are HUGE! Probably not brand new.  Really short charging cable.

An excellent buy for the price point,"These little things are pretty good for their price. The multiple earbud sizes are a plus (I actually had to go up myself to get a perfect fit). As they are earbuds, the noise canceling is excellent as the buds penetrate your ear canal. Sound quality is really good, although I think the bass is slightly high. There are also no controls on the earbuds themselves to advance tracks if you are listening to music; you have to do that from the actual device it is paired to. I made a test call and the microphone seems to work well if you speak at your normal conversational tone.  The charger is great: waterproof, can hold 4 full charges, is magnetic to hold the buds in place while charging, you can see the status of the charge (red/blue) through the lid of the case, and can see how many charges the case has left. They also included a little lanyard for the case if you want to use it.

So easy to use,"I’m very picky with audio equipment.  I always prefer to listen to audio media through noise canceling inside-ear earbuds.  This product was a pleasant surprise.  Long battery life on the case and the buds themself, perfect audio quality.  They are so easy to use, the only problem you’ll have is when they are remembered by multiple smart devices.  My only complaint is the strength of the bass.  The bass quality is great however, my go-to “new headphone test” is any rap song with a heavy 808 beat ie Top Back by T.I.  You can tell that the buds only have about 95% of the power required for loud listening.  All around great product.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great wireless Headphones.,The fact that these are waterproof are ideal for any type of situation.  The sound quality is one the best out there.  The fact that you can connect to either side of the ear bud is helpful when you just want one in.  I usually use one at a time and when the battery dies on one side I switch out to the other one while charging.  There are however some limits to the headphones.  The first being that they will lose connection to your phone or blue tooth device pretty easily.  Does not  matter where you place the device.  The charging time for the headphones is a little on the slow side but understandable with the recharging box.  Overall I would recommend this brand of wireless headphones.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear piece,"When the headphones work at 100% they produce great sound.

I wore these for over 3 hours outside doing yard work and not a sore or tender spot in ear afterwards. These are VERY comfortable. I do not need earbuds with any fancy functions, just great sound and excellent fit. ( Extra ear size fittings a good addition).

Left earbud kept cutting out,"Just got this product yesterday after ordering it the day before (very quick delivery). Once I opened the package I read the instructions, charged the charger and the earbuds and paired as instructed. Within an hour the left earbud started to cut out every 2-3 minutes for a second or two. I resetted the earbuds (per the manual) and the same things started happening again. Tried three times and finally gave up. For $50.00 I expect this thing to work right. Other cons, sound is not the best, the charging cord is very short (about 6 inches) and the range is less than about 10 feet. Just returned this product to Amazon.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Small, compact and overall a great product.","Sound is amazing, haven't had it enough to know how long the battery lasts on average, but I love how the case is a portable charging station. On a comfort level, I would say it's a 3.8/5. But like many earbuds, you can't lay on your side with them without feeling discomfort. Works great when at the gym and it grips your ear pretty well. I haven't tested the water resistance since I'd rather be safe than sorry. Final thoughts are I would definitely recommend this, it's almost up there with my wireless headphones. 4.2/5",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrible decision!,"The worst purchase decision in recent memory.  It was the relatively high rating that sold me.  Wish I'd never heard of this product.  The earpiece failed the very first time it  was used.  While on a simple walk, the device fell out of my ear, and was nearly impossible to find.  After a change of the fitting for the ear, a second attempt was made, and with the very same result.  Before the walk ended, the dang thing fell out again.  This was an awful decision.

An experience,"I may have a skewed perspective because I used cheap earbuds for working out for a long time, but when I first put these on and pressed play it sounded like the orchestra was in my head. The best trait of these headphones by far is the stereo control they have. Next would be their strong and clear bass. The only downside is that sometimes there is distortion in the mid to high range, but I haven't personally owned any headphones that don't have this. I'm a musician so sound quality matters a lot, and for the price these do an EXCELLENT job",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I am so pleased with these. The price is right and the sound quality is as good as any others I’ve listened to. And they fit my ears perfect!!!!

I had to CONSTANTLY keep adjusting them during my workout, it was so annoying. And lastly, trying to run with them in my ear, it was impossible!!!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They are buying 5 star reviews by giving away their other products,"I got these headphones because I have been interested in not having a cord running to my phone anymore, gets caught on things.  These headphones seemed to fit what I was looking for as the reviews were very good and when I first tried them the sound quality was good as well.  After wearing them a handful of times I noticed a number of things.
1. The left ear made a popping/clicking sound when I put it in, the sound that a plastic yogurt container with an aluminum foil lid makes when you just barely squeeze it.  My guess is that it has something to do with the pressure equalizing but since the right did not make a noise I reached out to the company to exchange them.  I was told that the ones I had must be defective and they would send out new ones so I have them in a few days.  After using them for another 1.5 weeks or so, waiting for my new ones to arrive, the bluetooth began to drop almost constantly.  The only way I could solve the problem was to have my phone in my hand in front of me or to have it in my button up shirt pocket, kinda makes it hard to do anything else.  After 1.5 weeks I reached out to the company again to ask what was going on as I was then interested in either returning the headphones.  They apologized and said that they forgot to put them in the mail and they would be at my house in 1-2 days.  After 4 days I got home from work and started the return paperwork when the second pair arrived.  I tried them for 1 day and found that they had the same bluetooth problem as the first.
2. When I got the headphones I signed up for their warranty program.  When you sign up for the program they ask for your amazon order number, if you have purchased more than one of their products in one amazon order then you need to email them so that both items get in their warranty system.
3. When you sign up for their program they also send you an email.  If you give them a 5 star review they will send you a free wireless charger.
4. I fully charged the ear buds and the box they come in and after 3 days of not using them the box was at half charge, horrible battery life.

They got 2 stars because the sound quality was really good, everything else was poor at best.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfortable Buds with Quality Sound,"After trying a couple other sets of wireless earbuds, here are the top 3 things I appreciate about the TOZO T10s.

First, they are very comfortable. I tried another set but they didn't seal well in my ears, and the sleeves had rough edges. I couldn't keep them in more than a few minutes before they started to rub and hurt. But the TOZO T10s have great soft sleeves that feel great and cancel noise well every time I put them in. And they're snug: they don't fall out when I'm working out or running, and that was the main reason I looked at these.

Second, the sound is fantastic! As I mentioned, the TOZO T10s cancel noise pretty well, and even at a quarter of full volume the music I listen to is well-balanced with the right amount of bass, treble, and everything in between. I'm very pleased with the sound quality.

Finally, the TOZO T10s look great. They have a low profile in my ears, unlike some wireless earbuds that are too large and bulky.

Besides these features, the charging case is sturdy, I like that the earbuds are magnetically held in the case for a good charge, and they pair easily to each other and to my phone/computer every time. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value for the price!,The reason for the three star reviews for noise cancellation and battery life is because I just received these yesterday.  So far I love them.  The sound is great and they are perfect for what I use them for.  I will update this review in a few weeks when I have used them more.  The quality is excellent and the price is right!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well spent money!!!!,"The best bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever had so far, i was looking for some discreet earbuds that i can wear @work to listen my music on. The package says the battery last for 4 hours each one, but I used it for 5+ hours before it disconnect (I only used 1 of them because of my type of job). The charging box for them is wireless charging compatible A+ (and I love it). They stay in place and don't hurt your ears. The battery on the charger works pretty well, I just charged it once since I got them 2 days ago (it says it comes full but I just charged them before I use them just in case). I have received calls and I haven't had any issues with interference or people don't understanding  what I'm saying (I work on a warehouse and there's a lot of noise in there).

TURN THEM BACKWARDS FOR A TIGHT FIT OR YOU WILL LOSE THEM AND NEVER FIND IT.,"Great product overall for a good price. Found them very user friendly. Water proof stood up to pool dip and heavy sweat.

I lost the left side running one day. IMPLEMENT A FIND FEATURE. You could easily do it with bluetooth or at least a bright flashing light.

Case could be slimmer. I didnt like carrying the case bc it was just barely too bulky for the pocket.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
100% Satisfied,"I give this product 5 stars because it's a great product for the price. It's a sturdy, low profile, and stylish. I haven't tested its waterproofing yet but there's a sketch of a guy swimming with them in the manual. The sound quality is good. However, if you're an audiophile and are meticulous about sound quality, you may find the sound in these ""satisfactory"". Honestly, you're probably not going to find a much better sound in earbuds of this nature and price. But overall, a good buy if you're looking for a cheaper alternative to airpods.

One thing I need to note; you may find people saying these earbuds have good noise canceling. While it is good, don't mistake it for ""active"" noise canceling. These earbuds will block as much sound as you'd think plastic and electrical components would. So just keep that in mind.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Dont waste your money.,"God awful. They cant hold a connection, so they unsync and sync repeatedly. They fall out of my ears a lot despite trying various angles of them being in there. They shut off randomly, which confuses my laptop audio software and then my gaming sounds end up blasting everyone around me. The mic has a hard time catching your voice at the start of your calls, and the overall sound quality is worse than the cheapest pair of Walmart headphones. Definitely would not recommend to anyone.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love these for driving & listening to music!,"I was not sure which wireless earbuds to buy. My niece told me she bought 2 different brands that were over $100.00 that were not loud enough & had difficulty connecting to her Bluetooth. Then she bought this pair & loved. That made my decision for me. She was right, they are amazing. They are easy to pair to my phone & sound is great. My husband just bought a pair once he tried mine. He loves it!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product, no big complaints.","These are a great pair of ear buds. Only issue i have, and i've had this issue with other similar products, every now and then it can't decide which one to send the signal to. i'll have the left ear bud in, and decide to use both and it will cancel the left and move it all to the right and vice versa. but just put them back in the case and pull them both out and works just fine.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent price, sound, and perfect fit with options for ear pieces.  Nice.","These earbuds fit perfectly, are fast to pair with your device, and come in a very nice charging case.

Keep up the good work.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Weak signal unless you are close to device,I love these headphones. However I rated 2 stars because you have to be very close to your phone or they lose connection. Even if I only walk to the next room they cut in and out. The point of having Bluetooth headphones is lost. Yes there’s no cords but I have to carry my phone. The sound is good and the noise cancelation is also very good.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for meetings and travel.,"I travel a lot and I'm on a lot of meetings that I need to call into. These headphones work great for both. I'm always a little skeptical with reviews, but these little gems are great. Sound quality is great, they're easy to set up, and surprisingly. The mic works really well. I've had no complaints on my business meetings that I sound muffled or can't be heard, which is fantastic.
The battery life of the fully charged earbuds is roughly 3 hours, which covers me for most flights I'm on. This is great for flights that I don't get my own personal screen, so I can just pair these with my Surface or iPhone. Once my headphones run out of juice, I just pop them into the case to be charges again. It's great because if the case is charged. I don't have to worry about plugging anything in.
It comes with multiple sizes for the silicone ear piece, and it was easy to swap then out for the smallest size to fit my ears.
I would definitely recommend these to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value and Quality!!,I love my wireless T10’s. I was worried that the low price meant I had to sacrifice something in the quality. I was wrong!! These headphones are amazing!! They are comfortable to wear. I have small ears and most earbuds hurt when I use them. I was able to adjust the tozo t10’s to the smallest size and I can wear them for several hours at a time. The sound quality is amazing. I use them at work and while exercising and have no problems keeping them in. I am able to answer the phone while listening to music. I love that they are completely wireless. There are no cords hanging on my desk while working. Definitely a great pair of headphones and totally worth buying!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds for the price!,"Super happy with my purchase of these wireless earbuds. At this relatively low pricepoint, you never really know what you're going to get, but the TOZO T10's definitely punch above their weight.  Sound quality is great, especially on the low end. They also seem to be able to play louder than different brands I've had in the past. Battery life is very good (and the charging case fits easily in my pocket), the quality of construction is solid, and I like the way they look.  I paid just under $50 and I think it's well worth it at that price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A huge step up from the last wireless earbuds that I had.,"There are a few things that I love about these earbuds.

The design - very sleek and the earbuds fit in my ears quite comfortably!
The sound - the sound quality, is great though I was the bass was a bit deeper.
The charging case - it seems like it's very durable and the fact that it has wireless charging is a plus!
Water Proof - I have a pool and used these in the pool and they work fine still.

Overall, a great product!

1 month later only one of the headphones are working correctly after taking them for a swim. (So I retracted my 5-star rating to a 2) The waterproof aspect is what sold me but I was ultimately let down.

Great for the price.,"I had originally bought some Kissral headphones before these. I did not like the base on the Kissral. I ended up getting these due to a bigger drive on earpiece.

Excellent wireless earbuds,"I am extremely happy with my Tozo T10 earbuds.  I have used them for 4 weeks in two different ways:  1)  at work  and 2) for running workouts.  For work, they do well with phone calls, noise cancellation, and music quality.  For running workouts, they work well with lack of slippage, water/sweat resistance, and music quality.  The battery life is pretty good for the most part.  For the money, this is a no brainer....especially considering the high quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprise! An inexpensive set of headphones that do it all very well for little $,"Let me start by saying this- I am a critical listener and I am very hard on headphones. I use them primarily for working out, where I sweat all over them, then take them to the sauna afterwards. I have been through several pairs over the years, and not one pair satisfied me. I started with the Motorola S9 about 16 years ago. Went through five pairs of those. I worked for Harman where I got anything below cost so had several pairs from JBL, Harman/Kardon, Infinity, and AKG.

When I got these I was sick of the cord between the buds, so these were my first true ear buds. I didn’t expect much and I waited a month and a half before writing a review. I gotta say, the sound rivals my AKG Herbie Hancock edition headphones. They actually fit and create a good seal so the bass is awesome. Controlled, smooth, and undistorted. Mods are nice and detailed and the highs are not harsh and forced like most earbuds sound.

The case is super nice, with a magnet that snaps the lid on the buds shut. They automatically come on and pair when you take them out. Every now and then I have to turn in the left one but it is rare. The only other drawback is on very limited occasions the left one cuts out for a half a second and comes back. Nowhere near enough to take away the fifth star.

I used to accidentally leave my phone near a workout machine and walk away, and within ten feet my old headphones would lose Bluetooth and let me know I was out of range. I’m not kidding- I can leave my phone on one side of the gym and walk to the other and the music is still strong. Whether that’s a good or bad thing, I would rather have it where it never cuts off.

Fit and balance are great. You can hardly feel like they are in. Where they really surprised me though was when I had to wait on hold for a long time to talk to an operator. I was driving and I finally got someone. Now, I’ve avoided using Bluetooth headsets to make phone calls because people are always asking “what?” Or saying “I can barely hear you- can you take me off of Bluetooth?” Not lying- it was like having a conversation in the same room, but with no background noise. I now use them for phone calls and it is much better than using the mic in my phone.

I have not found the end of the battery life yet, but I keep these in a case in my car charging all the time.

Suffice to say they vastly exceeded my expectations. I want to shake the person’s hand that led the design of these marvels. Aside from how good they are, the price is astounding. At any cost, these are the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. For $40, I feel like I stole them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of wireless earbuds!,"The sound quality is excellent and the battery life is as I expected with these earbuds allowing me to listen for hours without wires. The noise cancellation is very good but doesn’t quite compete with the Bose set I have for comparison. Overall, these are 5 star ear buds especially given the fact you can run in the rain in them and sound  isn’t distorted in the least.

I had an issue with the right master ear bud not working after about a month of having the set but customer service was quick to respond. They walked me through the reset process, which was also included in the packaging. Upon realizing that wasn’t the problem a new set was shipped to me. I would from this company who stands behind their product again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I liked these earbuds so much I gave mine to my grandson!,"I love my grandson, so when he was visiting the other day I gave him my TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds with {Wireless Charging Case}. Of course that means I am without until the new ones I ordered arrive. Amazon Prime - Tomorrow, Tomorrow I'll have them Tomorrow!
In the past I had couldn't find earbuds that were comfortable, so I bought ear phones for comfort.  This resulted in me going to sleep listening to a book and breaking the wires during the night.  I have spent a lot of money on those. I have had these earbuds since April 10, 2019 and have had no problems with them.
These are great! While I am at work I only put in one earbud. I listen to audio books and soon discovered if I put both earbuds in I can't hear the office phone ring or people talking to me. But is great at night when I want to be in the same room with my husband but prefer listening to a book than what he is watching on TV (yes, both earbuds in). Being able to place the case on a wireless charging pad is great! So much easier than using the cord and always having to turn it over because I didn't have the correct side up the first attempt.
Obviously, I have ordered again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disappointing,I'm confused by why these headphones get such good ratings- I bought them on that premise.

Not great for wearing in shower but they do work.  Overall an underwhelming pair of earbuds.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones,"They played continuous audio for 4 hours and 43 minutes. They really are waterproof, i have showered with them in multiple times. Audio quality and comfort is extraordinary.

Highly recommend these buds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bluetooth Earbuds I have Owned So Far,"I've had these for a couple weeks now and am very happy with the purchase. I can't speak to the longevity yet, but everything else has been great. The sound quality of these earbuds competes quite well against other more expensive earbuds I have used (airpods, JBL). The noise cancellation is great and they fit in-ear quite comfortably. Comes with different sized tips to find that right fit for you. The carrying case is compact and provides 4 charges for your buds before needing to be plugged into the charger again.

Overall I couldn't be happier with these. What you are getting for this price point can't be argued with. If you are an intense audiophile than I am sure you will find something to criticize, but then again you probably aren't using earbuds all that much either. For everyone else, I would highly recommend them. Easy to use, great sound, great fit, and great price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Moral of the story.  I'd pay 50 or 60 for these easy and they are under 40 bucks!

Very pleased with these earbuds!,"My boyfriend and I were very pleased with these earbuds! First of all, they pair and connect to your phone with ease. They do a really great job of cancelling out noise and produce great sound. I can put them on and study to some music without getting distracted by my surroundings. When put in correctly, I can work out without them falling out. One of my ears are a little smaller than the other though so one side doesn’t fit as snug as I’d like and I have to keep pushing it back in. But the other ear fits perfectly and I have no issues with the bud moving around or falling out. I really like the look and functionality of the charging case as well. I like that you can see the charging lights through the lid so you know everything is charging properly.

"Amazing sound quality in a tiny, affordable package","My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.

Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.

The controls on the earbuds themselves could be a little better; I wish there were some way of controlling the volume and skipping music tracks, but it only has play/pause and an assortment of call controls.

Unlike my previous earbuds, these don't play an audio indication whenever the music track changes, which is good (that was really annoying). Rather than playing little jingles on connect/disconnect, a voice speaks in English. I'd rather have a little tone but the voice prompts are pretty okay too.

I also tried recording a voice memo using the microphone, and while the signal level was a bit low (meaning I might come through a bit quietly on a phone call) the sound quality was fine, and surprising considering the microphone is physically in my ear. It might have trouble dealing with background noise. We'll see.

The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It's a bit big compared to the Apple AirPods, but it has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB. Which is something the AirPods still can't do.

All in all these are great little earbuds and are well worth the money. Even at their normal price they're orders of magnitudes less expensive than the AirPods or the Jabra Elite 65t, too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great for syncing to laptop for work,I bought these to replace my corded head set for my laptop for work. I was tired of being tied to my computer and ripping the head phones on and off whenever I needed to move out of my chair. These are fitting the bill quite nicely. The sound quality is good (only voice so far - haven’t tried it for music) and the included microphone in one of the ear buds works great - no complaints from folks I’ve been on web-based calls with. The battery charge seems to be better than expected - no problems during 4-5 hour sessions at the computer (both in standby and in use during that time).

Use in Hot Tub Everyday & Around Pool while Stretching,"I use them everyday in the hot tub. I’ve also used them in the steam room. I like that if your charging them with a Micro-USB cable you can fold the cover all the way back so they can dry better while they charge. When I get them really wet I let them air dry for a few hours before I charge them again.
They are louder than I thought they would be, very impressed with that.

I haven’t heard any complaints on call quality, on my end they sound good. Only used a few times doing that in the pool though when stretching ( usually don’t answer ).

Overall very satisfied so far.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound but even better customer service!,"These headphones are so worth the money! They last forever and when I have them in they are perfectly noise canceling. I take them running, shopping and to work and they don't fall out, very nice fit. The customer service is wonderful as well. I  had a few questions about the product so I wrote them a quick email and received a fast and thoughtful reply. Extremely happy with my experience!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good head phones, long battery","The battery life on these is great, but the sound is not as loud, and the noice cancelling is alright, but when you somewhere loud like a gym, it's a bit hard to hear",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for Exercise and Showering,"I've worn these for running and haven't had any problem with them falling out or going loose. They fit quite snugly. If you are not sure whether they will fit or not, four different sizes are provided to adjust to your ear size. The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is definitely on point. I haven't had any problems with the battery life. I worn them for over an hour and haven't had any trouble with them. The best part is that they are waterproof, so wearing them in the shower is great! If I don't want to bother my roommates by playing music on a speaker, this works as a great solution! TOZO also provides great service. They have really gone out of their way to ensure that I have a great experience, which will most likely be the case if you decide to purchase these as well.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Sound For Such a Little Thing!,"I got these for my workouts.  I sweat a lot, so I am always on the lookout for waterproof BT headsets.  When my last BT conked out on me, I searched on Amazon for the next one, and came across these.  After reading all the questions and answers and the reviews, I bought them.  They came the next day, and I immediately charged them.  It took me literally 20 seconds from taking them out of the charger, put them in my ears, to pairing them, for me to listen to my first song.  The sound quality is so much better than my last headset for sure.  But what I love most of all is that I can take a shower, and listen to my music without any interruption.  How cool is that?  I have had more expensive headsets in the past, but wasn't as happy as I am now with these.  For only $49.99, these are a steal!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality Headset!  Great Volume,I've had mine for only about a week so far but i'm loving them.  They last most of a day and will charge back to full in the case in under an hour.

Great Bluetooth Ear Buds,"In the past I have bought a few Bluetooth ear buds from Amazon.  For the price and the quality of this product, I could not approve of this product more than I already do.  A few of the pluses to this product: booming bass, clear mids and treble, qi wireless charging that charges the ear buds while off of the actual micro USB charger.  They are also waterproof! I'm sure if they ever have a problem, this company would stand by their product!

Broken after first swim,"This is supposed to be supporting swimming. I only swam for 10 minutes and one of the ear pods was broken right there that moment. The bluetooth was also unreliable.

My Best friend for pool walking and water running,"You have to fiddle a bit to find the best fit for the ear bud to keep the water out -so not exactly like regular earbuds. That said, these are the best thing I have added to my morning workout routine at the club. Great sound quality and connection to my phone while walking a 25 meter pool. I wear glasses all the time and they do not distort the shape of my ear to set my glasses wonky, nor are they pushed out of my ear when I move my glasses. The connecting and syncing is a little finicky when you're dealing with multiple items they can sync to (fitbit Versa and Android phone for instance), but once connected I'm good for an hour or more without interruptions.
True to technology, bluetooth does not travel through water, so the sound will cut out while swimming with your head in the water and occassionally while in the shower.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

You just drop the earpiece in the slot when you're not using it and it charges.  As soon as you pick it up, it reconnects with the device.  It does take a few seconds to finish connecting, but that's not even something that's worth getting annoyed over.

bluetooth ear buds you can trust,people try to give a accurate account on what they hear and we trust them and buy. sometimes they are right and sometimes they are dead wrong. well i been looking for a pair of blue tooth ear buds for 3 months and most of the big name brands like bose jabra and others have annoying issues and if you look at reviews its only 3 stars. well let me help you and save you time and money and a real review: I just bought the TOZO T10-R $35.00 i think it was and i must say  talking on phone has been good> Good tight fit . they are not falling out. most of all is the sound now if you are looking for all bass and not really sound then keep it moving but if you care about quality sound then stay right here .sound is really great i mean crystal clear and no delay in nothing video or music and there is enough bass to make you happy trust me. the more i listen to them the more i love them even at max sound level crystal clear .if i had just one more notch  of loudness they would be a 95 but 94 out of a 100 is not so bad. hope to help somebody because some of these reviews on others earbuds like the ones i'm returning are so sad. they say good or great  and its far from it.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What a great product for the price!,"I am totally satisfied with my new  TOZO earphones. Honestly it has gone beyond my expectations and is just exactly what I need at this present time. I have no complaints so far....I don’t know if this happens with every body but Just a word of advise, when you are about to use your ear buds, it helps to 1st take out the right ear bud and then the left ear bud 2nd while it pairs to your devices.  Majority of times I have found that doing it the opposite way would sometimes have only one of them working.... then you would have to reinsert it back on the battery holder and the take the R then L  for both to work  inSync together",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible buy!,"My 13 year old was desperate for a pair of apple ear pods and I was not prepared to spend that kind of money, especially after all the complaints I had heard about them.

"Great sound quality, great battery","These have very nice sound quality for the price. I have had a JBL Free X, which is more than twice the price and these sound as good as those if not better. The only downside is that they occasionally disconnect depending on the angle of  your head, but a little adjustment makes that go away. Note that almost all bluetooth in ear headphones do disconnect somewhat at this point so this is a non issue.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality for the good price,"Small and compact. Very comfortable fit in my ear.  Sound is very clear and crisp.  Right volume unlike some other brands that the volume were too low could not hear very well even when we turned the volume all the way up.  The TOZO T10 earbuds is great for the price and the quality can be compared to the expensive brand name buds.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I work at the airport, people lost their earbuds all the time, including me.  I lost 2 of my very expensive ones.  Surprisingly, I never lost the cheap ones even when I left them around charging or forgotten.  Nobody turned the expensive ones in even with my name and phone number labeled on it.  No one touched the cheap ones.  I told myself I will never to buy expensive earbuds again.  When I saw this one I said I'll try this one.  The price is in the middle range and hope the quality should not be too bad and better than the cheaper ones I got.  This way I will enjoy the music and the movies with this and would not get too upset if I lose another buds.  I am not disappointed with the quality.

Brilliant!!,"Wonderful!!
I was on the fence about buying some Bluetooth headphones but I ended up purchasing that's and wish I had done so earlier.

The headphones are great quality and very comfortable to wear. I have tiny ears and wear the smallest buds. They stay in amazingly well as don't hurt my ears like other types.

Then there is the case. I am blown away but the case as it holds additional charges for the headbuds. It has magnets that hold the earbuds in place and that also closes the lid. Sick a brilliant design!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Lot of Improvisation needed,"After a lot of research I decided to buy, but not worth the money

The good:
Amazing sound with good bass depth
Noise cancellation is good
Does not hurt the ears.
Holds charge for long period

The not so good:
Everytime you charge and wear, Frequent Connectivity Issues
Annoying message, right connection, left connection and pairing.
When you put it in the pocket, the connectivity is intermittent
When you move your head to left or right the loses connection
I believe, there are some channels in the earbuds and it keep shifting which is so annoying
Not ideal for phone calls, hard to hear for the people on the other side.
--Updated 6/4/2019
Terrible product, disconnects frequently, slight wind disconnects, turning your head disconnects, quite annoying. Not worth the money

----Update Review August 2, 2019
The seller contacted, sent another one to evaluate, I am increasing my stars to 4 as they followed up, I am taking off one star, I still have interference in the frequency intermittently, also this product is great for music and not for talking purpose, indoor calling is very feeble, outdoor calling is terrible, seller needs to explicitly state this until its good for calling purpose.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Unbelievable sound. I’ve tried and returned other other ear buds, but this is a keeper","I’ve tried and returned a number of other ear buds, disappointed in the sound, specifically the lack of bass.

Then I tried a channel with Eric Clapton. Same impressive sound. Lastly I tried Pink Floyd.  I can’t say enough, but I will 😃",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great earbuds, great price!","I was looking at a few more expensive models of earbuds and saw these on Amazon. I decided to try these given the reviews, water resistance and price. I have not been disappointed. These buds have great sound quality and stay in my ear very well. I have been very active with them and so far they have not fallen out. It is important to pick the right size ear piece for a proper fit (different sizes are included). Pairing is seamless on my iPhone no problems. I have had a few very minor breaks in sound when streaming Pandora, not sure if it’s the buds or the stream but not a huge issue at all. Phone calls are clear and have had no feedback saying that I cannot be heard. Overall for the price point these are great earbuds!

Update (10/11/19): The left earbud has stopped working and I contacted Tozo Support for warranty help. Prompt response with same day shipping of replacement earbuds.  I hope this pair lasts awhile but I know the company stands behind their product if I need help in the future.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Do not recommend,"I was really excited for these earbuds. I checked the reviews and they looked promising, so I caved and ordered them.

Once my package arrived, I noticed it was substantially larger than what I'd expect for a small box of earbuds. I picked it up and my heart dropped as I heard my brand new earbuds just sliding around, slamming on the sides of the box. Once I opened it, there was absolutely no padding inside. Just this tiny box of earbuds. So right off the bat I wasn't too happy due to poor packaging. Luckily, the earbuds didn't look damaged. I charged them for a bit before I paired them to my phone, which was quick and easy.

I wasn't a big fan on the sound quality. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do like to enjoy my music with decent audio quality, and this just wasn't cutting it. The bass? It just felt off. I'm not sure what it was, but it sounds ""flooded"" if that makes any sense. These are also not comfortable in the slightest. I probably wore these for about 30 minutes total and I tried every size that it came with. They all just hurt. Bad. My ears were so sore and I felt a huge sense of relief when I finally took them out.

The biggest issue I had overall was the mic quality. I made a phone call with these earbuds and I had to basically yell so they could hear me. After my call I recorded myself so I could hear what it sounded like, and I could barely hear myself even with the volume on max. I thought it was maybe my phone, but I tried it with another pair of bluetooth headphones that I've had before and it was just fine.

I realized that this just wasn't worth keeping. I spent an extra $16 and ordered a different pair and couldn't be happier. They're just all-around better compared to these TOZO T10's. I'm going to be returning them soon.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awful clipping in high frequency ranges regardless of input volume,"Excellent build quality, great feeling case, and great fitting earbuds. Not a fan of the button, you smash your eardrums just pressing it.

I had to return these however - the high end of these earbuds, regardless of volume level or EQ (i never use an EQ and i did try multiple devices), clips unbelievably. I'm actually shocked so many people seem to enjoy them. If you enjoy rock or metal stay away. Soft electronic, youtube videos etc were great. The second a drummer hits a cymbal you will cringe. Total shame because the low end response is pretty nice.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great upgrade.,"My second pair of earbuds and it was a supreme upgrade. Sound is great and definitely cancels out noise, as I use it often and also when mowing my lawn. I love being able to just use a single earbud at time. So far great buy for a great price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Does NOT work with Google Assistant (or probably any other),"The packaging and quality of these earbuds seems great. The case stays shut magnetically. The lid is black and you can see the lights inside representing the charge status of each earbud and the case itself. Charged very quickly. The sound quality was very good. The best sound quality of the 3 wireless earbuds I have bought so far (all similar price range) I would give the sound quality an honest 7.5/10 Crisp highs, clear mids, surprisingly well represented but still a bit muddy lows. I wasn't able to get the most sealed and comfortable fit with any of the provided tips.  Unfortunately I was lead to believe these were compatible with google assistant and that's kind of a selling point for me. I'll most likely return these for some that work with google assistant.

Earbuds with some SERIOUS BASS!!,"These are the headphones I've been looking for!

So far no connectivity issues, and the wireless charging is a plus!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall inconvenient and unreliable product.,"Not really satisfied with this product. I expected better sound quality, that said it's not horrible sound quality.

They are fairly comfortable to wear, even for hours on end. But they do tend to feel a little loose when you don't push them in all the way. That said, I've only had them fall out of my ear maybe two or three times.

My greatest complaint and the main reason why I waited them so poorly is the conductivity and pairing issues I frequently have the earbuds disconnect whenever I'm playing music I frequently have to position the phone just right so that it doesn't cutout. This happens even within 3 feet how's the phone. Quite the nuisance. However, I can oftentimes the within 15 ft of the phone and it will just be fine. I just wish it was consistent one way or the other.

Additionally, the trouble I have with the
Pairing is that I frequently have to re-pair them nearly every time I use them. Second, I have to have my phone on and unlocked and manually connect them whenever I leave my car in order for the earbuds to take over as the dominant Bluetooth paired electronic.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Glitchy and buggy...,"Not very pleased with these, and am thinking about seeing about a refund if it isn't too late. The sound is okay, when they work properly. Synching is easy, once they work properly.

Had a hard time getting them to synch, and when I did they were fine. For a couple days. After that, they had to be synched again. I only have them synched to one device, so I see no reason why I would have to keep doing it over and over. They sit right next to it every day, and are never more than five feet apart. But yet every couple days I have to synch them together again. Frustrating to say the least.

Sound? Okay, but not fifty dollars okay. Little too high on the highs, not enough bass. It's a little better using the medium sized rubber ends they give you, but even then, they aren't very loud. Meh...

Then we get to the most frustrating part of all. I listen to them at night while going to sleep. If I lie on my side and any part of the earbud touches anything, then the left side cuts off almost every time instantly. I can touch them with my finger, and they keep working, but for some reason if it touches part of my pillow, or arm, then it cuts off. Touching the right bud, turns off the left. Sometimes both cut off. Not sure if they are defective or what, but will do some searching and find out.

I do not recommend these, try different brand.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Poor performance,Given the number of positive reviews I couldn’t believe all the problems I had. The earbuds are too heavy for me and difficult to get out of the charger.

Great and satisfying experience at this price.,"Great quality at its price! Satisfied. 1/5 the cost of airpod but just the same thing, what more can you ask for? Was a bit sceptical at first but I got what I paid for. Great sound quality and noice cancellation. Really easy pairing. Reasons why it's worth 4/5 and not 5/5. 1). If you want to use these to listen to music, at least it should give you control of skipping a song or play back a previous track. Well, it can't do that. Most it can do is play or pauce by clicking either left or right earbud once. 2). If I want to just put on only one earbud and leave the one charging, well, I can't because the one you put on will continuously make this ""beep"" sound of trying to pair with the other one which gets annoying. 3). Putting on these earbuds should be easy and comfy. However, it really takes a while at the beginning for user to get used to how these fit in your ear without losing or felling figtigue. All in all, good quality at its price, but there are lot more areas to improve.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
pairing problem,"I thought the sound was very good and the noise cancellation was fine.  With that out of the way, let me tell you why 1 star.

 Great headphones for the price. Reading reviews helps and I would say these are mid range quality earbuds and are at a price that provide value. Bass is strong at times and present throughout music when needed. Treble sounds decent no bad complaints. Expected wireless static at times cannot be counted against the product as you cannot change radio theory this way. Battery time has not drained all the way in the ear buds yet and have been listening for countless hours (3-4 hours in spurts)  throughout the day at high volume...all while using the battery pod which DID drain daily (about 3 charges back to back). But quick recharge with wired or wireless charger was no issue. I give this product 5 starts. Yes it lacks perfect sound clarity at times and isn't state of the art.

I run and bike every day extensively every day, and have tried numerous earbuds and headphones to try to find something reliable and affordable. These definitely fit the bill. The earbuds pair very quickly to any Bluetooth device, and the charging case is a nice touch at this price point.

Original Review
I'm very torn on this product. These earbuds could easily be 5 star but the right/left sync kills it for me.

I've had these for a couple of months now and used them for walking (4 miles) and jogging. The left earbud looses sync with the right constantly. I have had maybe 2 sessions since I have purchased these where it only dropped sync a couple of times but I would easily say 60+% of the time the left earbud drops sync. The right earbud stays connected and never drops during that time.. this gets old very quickly especially since it happens during walking, jogging, riding etc. I've owned a different set of earbuds from anker and never had this issue. This is also on a brand new note 9 and an older note 5.

Sounds quality is excellent when everything is working.

I want to give this a 5, but the sync issue just kills it for me. If that can be fixed, these would be worth it to me.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good,"I wanted to love these because the reviews were so high but maybe my need for them were different. I need to be on long calls and the person on the other side couldn't hear me.

They're kind of chunky too so not an ideal size in your ear.
Connects to any bluetooth so my friend was able to connect to them while was using them

"Outstanding Earbuds, Great Product","What an amazing set of earbuds, I am thoroughly enjoying how they sound when paired to my devices.  I bought two and the price is justified in comparison to other brands.  The quality of sound is spot on and can be used to answer and speak with telephone calls.  Your device controls the volume levels.  Looking to get enormous usage out of these.  Great product “TOZO”!

The perfect wireless earbuds,"I originally thought that all these positive reviews were bought by the manufacturer, but I took the chance anyways..... It's $40 right?

I would absolutely recommend these to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I don’t know why you wouldn’t get these!,"So excited about these headphones! I use them at my work so I can answer a call if need be on the go or listen to music while on the grind! I love that you only need to have the right ear pod so you can still hear other things around you with your left ear.

Also, super simple and easy to pair; they basically do it themselves.

All positives here! Definitely worth it, especially for the unbeatable price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Superior quality, true bass, excellent sound isolation",So first off I wanna these headphones are exactly perfect for my situation I work construction therefore AirPods are a bit pricey to be having around my field of work further more the quality is excellent they completely block outside interference and bring you true in depth audio with proper bass to hit all those deep tones also the water proof functionality is no joke I’ve never submerged them as it says not to do so but I have gotten them wet and they still work perfectly fine and the customer service here is also nothing to worry about they are definitely organized and on top of the game I highly recommend these phones coming from an audio engineer it should be 6 stars rated,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BEST TRUE WIRELESS EARBUDS YOU WILL FIND FOR THE PRICE! PERIOD!!!,"First, let me say this a real review. I don't write these very often, so rest assured when I do one, its because I really really like a product.
I first tried a brand of buds called,""Thor,"" and they were basically garbage. Only one side would pair. So, i sent those back and thank God I did because I started reading reviews more carefully and payed close attention to HOW MANY their were which is really really important.
OK, so here it is: My experience with TOZO has been great from the very start. I had read all the reviews about how good their customer support was and they were all true.
1) the packaging is awesome with extra tips, cord, and warranty info. make sure you put the right bud in your ear first and then the left. those will pair because the right is the master. Then, activate your blue tooth on your device. you will want it off until the right and left pair to each other.

2) a one year warranty that's totally worth it. BUT YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE IT WITHIN 14 DAYS OR SOMETHING. It's WORTH IT. I'm supposed to GET A FREE WIRELESS CHARGER too. YOU WILL LOVE THESE EARBUDS SO IT'S EASY.
3) battery life is great so far
4) sound quality is really good. I would prefer them a little bit louder but I'm a sound engineer and you shouldn't go by my volume levels considering I've probably lost some of my hearing already. For most normal folk the loudness is fine
5) they are pretty comfortable. wireless buds can always be more comfortable IMO but that's just the nature of true wireless

ENJOY!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buds,"Just got them,  so far I'm really impressed.  Usually ear buds fall out of my ears due to odd shape of my ear canal and sweat. However they've stayed in thru all that.

I have to test them out in the shower but other than that everything they say they are is true.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good Product. Connectivity is a Little Suspect.,"Pretty sleek little earbuds. Definitely play around with the fitting sizes, as I almost lost one in the grocery store the 2nd day I had them.

Frustrating!!!!! Do not buy them!!!,"Update 9/22: The battery is BAD!

First of all, it doesn't last more than 2.5 hours on full charge
Secondly, it goes from 70% to 30% in 20 minutes (FALSE DISPLAY INFO!)
Thirdly, it gives you ""low battery"" warning at 30% and then leaves you with only 1 minute to get to the charger before it dies. So even if you're on a short run, you'd have to finish your run with no audio.
Fourthly, the charging case is subpar.

Extremely Disappointed!,"How disappointing!
With over 14k reviews and 4.5 Star rating, it was based on those reviews and that rating that I purchased these earbuds. So unless I got a lemon those reviews are either misleading or expectations of a product are very low.

Initially, the sound quality was awesome listening to music but when I used it for voice conversations over mobile, the person on the other line asked me to call them back when I'm in a less than noisy area.  Then more people told me to not use 'whatever i'm using' when speaking to them because there was too much noise coming in.  The sad part is, I wasn't in noisy areas so you can't imagine how disappointed I was.  So I purchased another earbud for talking and used these Tozo's only for listening to music at the gym and they were worked well until... One morning less than 2 months since I purchased them the left earbud would not connect.

I've had the lack of connection issue about 3x since I purchased it and that is not acceptable.  Considering I have used these earbuds about a couple dozen times in less than 3-months, this is extremely disappointing.

Oh btw... the range of the 5.0 Bluetooth SUCKS!

The sound quality is very good and the noise cancellation is average.  If the left earbud wouldn't go out anymore these earbuds would be awesome for listening to music ONLY. NOT PHONE CALLS!

PROS
-Nice design
-Great for listening to music
-Sound quality is very good
-Cool carrying case that charges the earbuds
-Fit comfortably in my ear

CONS
-Not good for voice talking
-Bluetooth range is horrible
-Left earbud issues. Didn't turn on a few times in less than 3 months
-You can't control volume from the earbuds",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sound for a reasonable price,"Fit is very good, hard to tell they are in my ears.  The sound is awesome.  Consequently, the passive noise canceling aspect is great.  I wished the battery lasted a bit longer, but the case charges the headphones, so that helps a little.  Probably good to take a break while they charge.  The button on the right headset is stiff and hard to press without moving it around in your ear.  Overall, great earbuds for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Doesn't connect well,"I had another pair of wireless earbuds that didn't last very long and thought I'd go with these after all the good reviews.

Fake +ive reviews BEWARE!!!,"I bought two pairs and not one of these worthless piece of S***. It is nothing but Chinese knockoff product. I have tired all the silicon buds provided with it and no matter which one I use, they refuse to stay inside my ears. Thousands of positive reviews got me conned. I am not even able to return these since i got them from the US and i live in the UAE. Beware and don't fall for them. Go for branded ones which are expensive but worth the cost. I got the Jabra elite active 65T which is bang for bucks. I so regret buying these junk funk.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sub-par headphones and poor customer service,"This is an edited review after quite a bit of use. The Bluetooth connection is awful despite everything I have tried. I have a set of Bose QuietComfort 35 that I use around the house with immaculate connection even if I'm in a different room from my phone. These, however, skip and drop the connection even if I'm holding my phone (connection point). Also, I was promised a cheap [free] wireless charger by the manufacturer if I left a positive review. The discount code is garbage and the initial positive review they bought from me was no more than a purchased review.

Low-quality Bluetooth headphones and a fake offer for a free charger.  Even if the company likely offers a working code after seeing this review, my review of the actual headphones stands. Look elsewhere.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Easy Pairing, Great Battery Life","Love how easy it was to pair the buds. I typically only use one at a time and love that when one of the buds dies, I can put it into the case to charge and pop the other one in to continue listening. Doing it this way, I can easily get 8 hours of battery life between the two buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Beautiful deep sound, BUT bluetooth and battery is poor","The bluetooth reconnection is less than desirable. Iphone to headphone connection is 1 out 10 without requiring going into the iphone bluetooth settings and manually selecting connect.
The battery life is okay. Getting 1-2 headphone charges from the case is not up to average expectations.

The sound is 5 by 5. Most non-Apple headphones are about loud enough with poor tinny sound quality or 4 by 1.

I am giving them a 4 due to the poor bluetooth and battery. I will be keeping them as no other $50 headphones have sound quality that is comparable.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Better than expected/ Highly recommend + Great price,"So upon receiving my earbuds i let them charge and immediately tested them for sound quality. They were great, they do not cancel out noise completely but that is okay for me since I am a person that likes to be aware of my surroundings. They fit just right and i like that hey come with different size rubber earbud pieces too. One concern i had was when I made a phone call to test out the sound quality on both ends. My cousin could barely hear me, in her words, “it sounded like I was under a rock” lol Frustrated i wanted to return them or exchange them, but something made me check again by calling my dad and my sister-in-law. It was loud and clear with both calls!!! Guess my cousin could use a pair of tozo10 earbuds for Christmas lol",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Heavy on the ear, but great deal overall","These are great little alternatives to Air Pods. The battery life blows them out of the water.

Good quality bluetooth earphones,"I ordered these earphones because I just upgraded to an iPhone, and I hate Apple's earpods/airpods. These were a great alternative: more comfortable, great sound, and better price point.

Make sure you have the right size of plug on them to fit your ears.,"I bought these for my granddaughter and she loves them and uses them everyday about 12 hours a day. I love that you can attach the included lanyard to the charging unit and take it with you wherever you go.  The earbuds arrived earlier than expected which is always cool. The ear buds stay in pretty well even when shes running except when she takes
off her hoodie. The price is very reasonable considering how good the quality is.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound... but only if you are sitting still and relaxing.,"These earbuds become dislodged and fall out of your ear during moderate to vigorous activity.  They will remain secure and produce their awesome sound as long as you are relatively sedentary.  They are perfect for the morning train commute, unless you need to run to catch your connection.  Then, they will likely fall out of your ear.  They are durable.  But they just aren't secure enough for activity.

By the way, the self charging storage container is pretty cool too.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound will cut out on earbuds,Sound will cut in and out.  This is my second set of ear buds I have purchased on amazon.  First set was cheaper about $25 and sounded better.

The Best Ever,"After I decided to get wireless earbuds to use with my Apple watch, I did some online research as I knew nothing about earbuds.  I finally decided upon the Tozo T10 because it had the highest percentage of positive reviews of all that I considered -  85% of the reviewers gave them 4 or 5 stars.  I also liked that they came with a choice of 4 ear caps to ensure the best possible fit.  I placed my order on a Monday afternoon and they arrived on Wednesday morning using standard shipping.  Even though I am technologically challenged, it was super easy to pair and connect them to my watch.  They fit comfortably and IMO the sound quality is exceptionally good.  I am very well pleased with the Tozo T10 and when the time comes to replace them, I would definitely buy them again.  I have received excellent customer support in response to my questions.  They are exceptional quality for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Product. Perfect Price Point. Great Performance.,"The headphones came fully charged and ready to go outta the box! The process of the setup was quick and easy. Just read the enclosed quick read documents first and you will have no issues. It's darn near dummy proof.

The bluetooth worked perfectly for both earbuds. Be sure to select the Tozo-R after your device (in my case it was a cell phone AND my chromebook) picks up the signal.

Sound quality is near perfect with a healthy deep sound (not tinny) and they can get loud enough to block out noise around you. However, I would not classify them or expect ""noise canceling"".

IMPORTANT: The fit depends on how much you paid attention to the instructions. You may (or may not) need to change the rubber heads to a larger or smaller size than the ones initially attached. This is easy to do. If they move too much or easily fall out, increase the size. If they are hard to get in or are too uncomfortable, use a smaller size. Easy peasy! Also, pay attention to how you put them in, and remember to give them a small slight twist as Tozo INSTRUCTS in their documentation.

Another solid feature is the charging case.
Once the case is fully charged, you can charge the ear buds 3-4 times before needing to charge the charger again, and each time the buds will last 2-3 hours give or take depending on usage.

As far as the waterproofing goes, I've only used them in the shower a few times and nothings changed after the fact, by way of quality or functionality.

Overall, if your looking for inexpensive, but not ""cheap"", truly wireless Bluetooth ear buds with great fits and exceptional functionality, the Tozo T10's are a great buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Minor complaints but they survived the wash,"Overall, I really like these headphones. Some minor complaint: 1) they cut out sometimes when I walk on the trail by my house. But that could be a problem with my phone's bluetooth. 2) I tend to only want one headphone it at a time but if I have the other turned off or on the charger it beeps at me so I have to have them both on and close by to use them, even if I only want to use one.

I accidentally washed them with my clothes and although I of course do not recommend this, they have been working perfectly fine since.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wont turn Off,"I have had these for a week or two now and the biggest thing is that I cannot get them to turn off and stay off. Even when they are in the charging case they will turn on and connect to my phone. Another thing is while the base is good, it has this weird feedback if the volume is where I normally listen to it and causes the music to sound poorly recorded. I feel like I wasted money. There have been a few things lately I feel have not been the quality described on amazon that I buy and then am disappointed. This is one of them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Overall, great product!","Almost everything about this product is great. The only real flaw I’ve found which I’ve also found in countless other earbuds is finding a earbud that fits my ear perfectly and comfortably. I was able to find a size that will work for what I need but not quite perfect.

However, the sound quality and noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.

I have had no problems at all with connectivity.

Overall, great product!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The best ear buds you can buy for under $50! ❤️,Great product! I am very pleased with this purchase. I was so afraid that the ear buds would be too large for my ears because mine are soo small but they are perfect. They come with different size silicone covers so you can choose what size you need. Also comes with a cord you can attach to the case for convenience.

Great choice for wireless earbuds!,"I had not had any previous experience with wireless earbuds before but wanted to try a pair with all my colleagues in the office starting to use them.  I had seen a lot of people using the Apple brand, but I really wanted something that sealed off in my ear more, quieted my surroundings, and could also be used exercising, etc.  I knew that Apple would not do that for me.  I also knew the Apple brand was overpriced.  I did some research and ending up buying the TOZO T10, even though I initially didn't recognize the brand name.  I liked the design and the reviews seemed positive.

I have now had the T10's for about a week and after figuring out how to charge, pair, and use them, I think they are great.  I was really impressed from the start with the packaging and the overall fit and finish of the product right when I received it.  The earbuds themselves are great quality and the charging case is also really good quality.  The case is a battery and charges the earbuds even when the case is not plugged in.  You do have to charge the case periodically, but it works really, really well.  I really like it.  There is attention to detail in the construction, for example the case has a top that is magnetic and closes tightly.  The earbuds also magnetically snap into the case for accurate connection when charging.  The lights on the earbuds and case show (1) when the earbuds are charging and when they are done and (2) how much charge the case has left.  Overall, a very quality product.  I cannot state that enough.  As far as using the earbuds, I had no issues with them pairing with my IPhone the first time and now they automatically pair with each other and with my IPhone when I remove them from the case.  Basically, removing them from the case turns them on and placing them in the case turns them off.  Again, really smart design.  Finally, I have found the quality of the sound is good.  I have listened mostly to podcasts up to this point, but the music I have listened to has been clear and met all my expectations.

Overall, if you want a great pair of quality wireless earbuds that have great fit and finish and are also waterproof, the TOZO T10's is what I would recommend.  It is also a super price point!  Do it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound. Bad fit.,"Initially, I was super excited to find these. Unfortunately, after trying the different sizes they don't seem to stay in. I wanted to use them to talk on the phone and to listen to my music.  However, that's not happening because no one can hear me when I have them in and they fall out when I walk. Translation - I can only use them when I doing limited movement i.e. sitting at my desk.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are the ones youre looking for.,I work out a lot and these are the perfect headphones for it. When you put them in your ear it blocks out everything else. I feel like its just me and the music.

The charging case is very sleek and even has magnetic slots for the headphones so they will not pop out.

Solid purchase,"I'd give this something between a 4-5 but the rating system won't let me indicate that. In any case so far I'm very pleased with the purchase:  each bud toggles between my various phones automatically based on which I'm using, which is great.  I've noticed that you have to manually disconnect it from the laptop (I have a macbook) or else it won't automatically switch over to the iphone.  The only other thing I noticed is that there's certain apps (eg, SoundHound) on the iPhone that won't allow me to listen thru these earbuds.  But overall given the price difference with other quality earbuds I'm happy with the purchase.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds especially for the price.,"I purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to replace another brand of earbuds that had stopped holding a charge after 18 months. The TOZO earbuds work great. I use them several times every day as I walk my dog. The pair seamlessly with my phone, have great sound quality, and battery life. The charging case was a must for me and it’s works great. They come with a variety of size silicon earbud tips, which was great for me because I needed the smallest ones for a good fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds great and is solid for workout!,"I recently bought a cheap pair of earbuds and the sweat from my workout turned them into earplugs and nothing more. So, when I looked on Amazon I found the TOZO T10 water-resistant earbuds and made the purchase. I am so glad I did!. Once they arrived I loved the solid feel and case that snapped shut. The case holds about 3-4 workout sessions (about 90 minutes each) worth of charges. I charge the case about once every two weeks and haven't had one time where they were dead. Just pay attention to the 4 blue lights that denote the battery life. The sound quality depends on whether you use the tight fit rubber ear pieces (it comes with 4 sizes). I like to hear/feel the base so I use the small pieces and ""stick"" it in my ear for maximum hold. It took about 2-3 tries to get the right fit that would hold from moving around a lot and sweating during cardio. The larger ones ""felt"" better but the slightest movement and they were falling out. Overall, I am glad I invested in this project and have not had any trouble with pairing, charging, or sound quality. The only issue I have is that you have to pair in the correct order; pair the left with the right...then pair the right with the phone. Otherwise, you're not pairing them altogether.

Nice sound but needs tap controls,"Battery life is lacking and it has no controls from the buds like double tap to skip. Some people say they are able run with them, but for me I have to readjust them while jogging so not the best for active movement but i5 can work. If they had one size bigger ear inserts then maybe it would work better. I do like the sound and bass quality for such cheap buds. Also the ability to use QI charge is convenient.  The ability to throw them in my pocket makes them portable and great for when I go solo to Disneyland for the day.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cheap for a reason.,"I used to own Apple AirPods, but the darn thing doesn't stay in my ears. I wanted to buy a true wireless, in-ear buds on the cheap, and came across the Tozo T-10. At first, the design was sleek and once paired, the sound was quite decent. It's also compatible with my Qi wireless charging so it felt like it was $40 bucks well spent. The following day, problems started to occur. First was the Bluetooth connection. Once it's paired to my phone, it refuses to disconnect even if the buds are in the case. The thing doesn't even stop playing while in the case which drained batteries on my phone and the ear buds. To disconnect, you would have to hit 'forget this device' beforehand. The other issue is the sound dropping. About 40% of the time, you'll hear sound from one side even when there's nothing blocking/disrupting the connections. About 30% of the time, the sound will skip. I am trying to justify that it only cost me $40 bucks to use it once in a while, but damn...

Pros:
- It's $40 bucks

Cons:
- Continuous play on a full charge only lasted 3 hours of audio play time
- Buds turn on automatically even though it's turned off. User must click 'forget this device'
- Sound often drops or skips",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Returned them- they kept cutting out,"I really liked these earbuds except for one major flaw.  The charging case was a great design with an opaque lid so you could see the charging status of ther case and each bud. It looked like a cute little robot face. The buds fit well and sounded good but here is where the  flaw appeared. The sound would cut out for a second then return. This happend frequently, sometimes a dozen times or more per hour. I sent a message to the seller (Worgo) but received no response. So back they go.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Fit and sound,"I also am one of  those people who cannot wear just any earbuds.  Finally I have found a pair that fits.  When I workout I sweat, and these earbuds stayed in my ear.  The sound is great also.  When answering the phone with them the quality is great also.  I do wish that you could forward to the next song, but I can forgive that because they are able to stay in my ear.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time keeping earbuds in their ears when they are working out.  Also I love the fact that the charging case is waterproof also, and the case comes with a strap.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price,"Snappy connection speeds, decent connection range. The sound is definitely on the bassy side if you're into that, but overall it sounds pretty full and pleasant for most genres excluding classical, jazz, and the like. Obviously, you're not getting studio-quality true-to-sound audio in a wireless budget earbud, but for normal listening, $50 is a great deal for these things. They're 100% worth the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product with great quality and cheaper price, love it","the first time you open it you will feel the bad quality they use in it.
After using it and during phone calls; you will notice how the voice come and disappear by it self, you will keep checking voice level during the call.
The battery consumption is bad, even if it was fully charged and you didn't use for 2 days the battery will die.
As a conclusion i regret buying it and i wish i went for a higher earbuds level or a well known brand.
But eventually if u want want to save money you have to pay the price

Update,

After writing my review, the company sent me apology mail with a new earbuds the same i bought, the new one is amazingly working fine with great voice and music sound. Maybe the first one was damaged as they said. But the new one they sent to me for free is great

I really love this product and i highly recommend this to anyone who don't want to pay that much money on Apple or Bose products and get almost the same quality.

Thanks Tozo for the first response to my review and solving the problem without even asking for it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good quality, nice sound, good battery","Bought these as a gift for my husband to use at the gym. He loves them! Did have one little snafu where one earbud wasn't staying connected, but I contacted the seller who was helpful. My husband had to clear out all his bluetooth connections and re add the earbuds. Now they seem to work just fine.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not an upgrade from my wireless earbuds with wire from ear to ear,"Terrible battery life, about 3 hours max listening to music. Can't work all day and use these....
Also getting them going take a while as they are a little goofy with how they connect to each other then to your phone.
Other than that, the charging case thing is cool and they see good quality but those two things are a deal breaker to me, lost time and not useful for someone who uses them while working and doing construction work.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall Great Pick for wireless earbuds,"This is my first set or truly wireless earbuds, but I made sure to read up on features and see reviews before purchasing.  My biggest hesitation before buying was that I was worried that the sound quality couldn’t possibly be as good as my trusty wired earbuds.  But, after reading many of the reviews on many other types, this one came back with a lot of good comments about sound quality, so I gave in and ordered them in white.

Now i have only had these for a day or two, but I am happy to report that the sound quality is actually As-Good as my wired ones, which themselves were great.  Not only that, the bass quality was right on point as well.  Huge plus.

Comfort:  I have fairly small ears, and I was worried about them being heavy or not fit properly.  I was also worried about them making my ears sore.  Well, I am happy report that I wore them for several hours last night and for several hours again today - no pain.  They are not nearly as heavy as I was expecting, which was another big plus.  As for the fit, I needed to put the smallest of the silicone earpieces on them, but then they were a good fit.

They didn’t fall out as I moved about my kitchen (even danced a bit -lol) and they stayed put.

Battery: the left one died a few minutes after unpacking the box, but after charging them, they  lasted about 4 hours before the battery level getting low.  I charged them overnight, and they lasted another 5 hours.  The charging is FAST, though, so you don’t  have to wait hours and hours for them to be ready to go again.  So would I love them to last longer on a charge? Yes probably...but for my lifestyle, 5 hours is plenty.  (Updated note: after owning these for a couple of months, they only last about 3 hours before needing a charge, and the right one doesn’t hold a charge as well as the left one for some reason.  This might just be my pair. We will see over the next few months if they continue to decline...)

Phone call use:  I did a test call and I could hear the other person fine, and they could hear me...they just said it was slightly quieter than normal, but still could hear me clearly.

The background noise blocking was moderately good.  I think if the fit was really snug it would be better,  but I’d say they were about 80% as good as my noise-cancelling wired earbuds.  But I still have to take them out if someone wants to talk to me, so it blocks plenty of sound out.  And if your fit is better, I’m sure it would be great.

Signal:  the packaging says the distance range is about 10 meters.  I tested that and I think I went farther than that without them disconnecting.  Maybe I should measure next time, but no need.  I went far enough to be impressed.

Updated note: these little guys don’t like to be separated, though.  If you are only using one in your ear and one on a table or somewhere not in your ear (but turned on), there tends to be an intermittent sputtering of the sound until they are close together again (I.e., both in your ears).  It happens less when they are fully charged,  and if you only want to wear one, just don’t turn on the left one and you’ll be fine.

Overall thoughts:  I am very pleased with these.  I love the sound of my music and not getting tangled up in cords, or feel the shock of accidentally ripping one out of my ear because of getting caught in cords.  Bring on my moving-constantly lifestyle - I’m ready to enjoy my wireless life!  Totally worth the price.  Get some.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for running and working out.,"I like this product because the ear buds come in different sizes to prevent them from falling out. I always have a difficult time trying to find ones that fit so I have tried many different brands.
I use them in the gym working out 4x/ week and for running 18 miles/week.
The sound quality is great for the price. The bluetooth initial pairing is easy and stays connected when in use.
The charger holder works great on a charge pad.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Quality!! Superior Sound Quality!,"I just received these two days ago and I'm already LOVING them.  They charged quickly, paired really easily with my iPhone and work beautifully.  They had the smallest ear bud cover option which means they fit comfortably in my tiny ears without slipping or falling out.  The range is fabulous - I'm able to walk around the office without having to take my phone with me.  The charging station is easy to transport, and charges via wireless itself so it's super convenient.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth ear buds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Survived my washing machine and then the dryer,"These things are better quality than anything wired or wireless at the price point. They have a great build quality, great sound, come with a great selection of sizing tips, and are water tight sealing. These are perfect for work or sport, connect easily, and are durable. After about two months of use mine went through the washer and dryer and work perfectly. They have a great warrenty but I dont see myself needing it. They have a good battery life and good case. Overall its a great product and better quality than its price point suggests.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless headphones,I really love them. I like the sound quality. It is very loud which i love. The noise cancellation is very good. You cant hear a thing when you have the volume all the way up. The headphones havent died on me which is great. Although there has been problems connecting the wireless headphones to the device. There is two bluetooths that try to connect at the same time which i dont understand. There a is a bluetooth just for the right and just for left but anyways which ever you press it should wconnect both ear pieces to your phone. I do feel like the size is not accurate enough. I thought they would be smaller but they ended up being ok. Other than that there is mothing wrong with these headphones.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10-Great Value- Highly Recommend,"I have been using these headphones for about a week, and so far so good!  The sound quality is great.  I have not yet tried to do any physical activity with them in yet, so I can't speak to that.  I mainly use them at my desk and for walking around.  Once fitted correctly, they stay in place just fine doing normal, everyday activities. I am looking forward to trying to exercise with them soon.  I think the value for what you get, is great, I highly recommend.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value wireless earbuds!,"I was looking for something top replace my Beats over-ear headphones for working out and studying. I definitely wanted an option that was smaller, more portable, and still had a lot of bass. I found these and after reading the awesome reviews, decided to purchase them. I'm so happy I did!

Not what the description says it is.,"Very misleading description and product. The sound is muddy and I can still hear what’s going on in the inside. I was listening to some Tangerine Dream, but the sound was too muddy to hear the rest of the instruments. Also, the sound cuts off at random times for 1 second and it becomes an annoyance. Never buying from this price range or products from this seller again. I have $10 Skullcandy earbuds and even they sound better.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A nice surprise!,"I have a serious hearing issue and have problems with even the more expensive headphones. I decided to take a risk on these and came away with a pleasant surprise. Volume is no problem for me. I can hear the media, but  understanding it is something else. Something about these earbuds just seems to resonate with me. I haven't had them for long, so I don't know what the long term will bring, but being able to enjoy a night of music was a pure pleasure. They paired up easily then paired right to my phone and my pc with no problem. I even watched (and understood) a movie on Netflix,
Yes, I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for some decent headphones at a good price.

Follow-up after using them for a month.-
These earbuds are awesome, For music the bass is really great but not so much that it overpowers the clarity of conversation in tv shows and movies. I have a severe hearing difficulty. Volume is no problem for me, but the words are just noises that I can't decipher. The Tozo earbuds have made it possible for me to watch tv and movies and not lose much of the conversation. I have tried several sets of earbuds owned by family and friends in the last month, some of them better known brands. From my personal experience, I wouldn't trade my Tozo ear buds for any of them. The customer service is great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buy with confidence,"These earbuds are pretty good quality for the price. With that being said, I bought these T10 wireless earbuds a couple of months ago and I'm having technical issues with them. THANKFULLY THIS COMPANY OFFERS A 1 YEAR WARRANTY FOR FREE! The connection seems poor because it often breaks like if they're too far apart from each other, and sometimes the volume in one of the earbuds will go all the way down and then it will go back to normal as if it was off and it was barely powering on. I emailed the company and they happily suggested they would send me an all new pair at no cost to me! I'm extremely happy with their costumer service and I highly recommend these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bluetooth earbuds,"These come in a nifty charging case with its own battery. They have good sound quality and good bass.

Great earbuds for the price!,"For the price, you cannot beat these earbuds. Very good sound quality. I use them all the time. Battery life is very good. Much better than I expected at this price point.  I highly recommend them.

Update:  After reading some of the other reviews, I want to clarify mine. I only use these when I sit in the garage to enjoy a cigar. I don't know how they work for exercise or any activity when you are moving. If you block the right earbud, the left one will cut out. Not an issue for me. I usually listen to jazz with them. The sound quality is pretty good at the price you pay. You want $300 quality, then buy a $300 set of earbuds.

SO typical....,So the expiration date for the return was two days ago and these stopped working.  Sadly this has become par for course with so many items over the past few years.

They SUCK BALLS AND AMAZON AS WELL,"So far, absolutely awesome.

Update : 9-13-19

They suck balls!!!! It takes at least 5 trys to get them to connect with my Galaxy Note10 Plus. If I have the right ear in and want to put in the left later, that's a big no go. I have to take both out, put them back in the charging case, wait a few minutes then try again. When cutting the grass with both in, they fade in and out. Both will play, then just the right, then both, then just the left, then both and so on. They just flat out SUCK. Also, I was supposed to get a free wireless charger if I left a nice review. Well that was a no go as well. Still waiting on the f'ing charger. They sent me some code to use at checkout which never worked ever worked. Just a shady a** company. Don't waste your money people. Spend a little more and get a good product with good customer service. Hell even Amazon is screwing me on this one and I just signed up for Prime. Real f'ing nice to both of them",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound quality, bass and battery life","When I first bought these headphones, I only intended to use them for work. I got them, started using them and fell in love. I didn't expect much sound quality or good bass for that matter but these earbuds pack a damn punch. I ended up using these everywhere and eventually lost them (and the case) as they had fell out of my pocket which to me is the only downside, but I ended up ordering another pair because I can't do without my good sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
MEH / Okay earbuds / downgraded review (after 4 weeks),"The sound is good but inconsistent ! They are comfortable and stay securely in your ears.I really like the charging box. I bought the white so that I can see the lights through the closed box. I'm not as happy with this purchase as I was originally. They work best if you sit still and don't try to move around. Sound will cut out from time to time. It only cuts out briefly but still, it can be pretty irritating. For instance, if you have your ipod or phone in your pocket and you lift your leg, the sound will sometimes cut out for half a second or so. I may just have to go back to corded headphones or a different brand of buds.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound at a great price,"I ordered these earbuds after my last pair (Phaiser BHS-730) died after only 2 years. I ordered these and have had them for a two weeks or so. I use them 5 days a week at work for around 5 hours each day. I am a commercial landscaper and mower. The sound quality is very comparable to the Phaiser BHS-730 I had, maybe a little better. It handles all types of music well. The highs and lows are definitely enjoyable. The battery life is interesting, they work excellently for me, but this is because I am able to throw them in the changing case and carry them in my pocket between jobs. They definitely charge quickly but the charge doesn’t last forever. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I love that I am able to wear sunglasses (no over ear hook to get in the way) and a winter hat (they don’t stick out of your ear too far) without any problems. The fact that they are very water proof is fantastic because I get rained on a sweat considerably at my job. And they will handle workouts well. The noise cancellation is pretty good. When the music is on (mid level or about as loud as most will listen) and the earbuds are properly seated I can barely hear the loud mower or backpack leaf blower I am using. The only thing that I don’t love about these earbuds is that you can not control the volume from the earbuds. You have to use your phone. Other than that, couldn’t be happier. I would definitely recommend buying",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The TOZO sound is GREAT, they are comfortable, light, easy to pair with my phone or I-pad, and charge easily and quickly. And they are waterproof when working out, swimming, or caught out in the rain.  I also like the compact pocket-sized charging/storage case.

I plan to tell my friends and family how great these earbuds are.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Game changing headphones!!,"Probably the best $50 I have spent in a very long time. I have an affinity for quality headphones (Bose QC, audio technica) and I find myself reaching out for these over my over-the-ear phones because of convenience and comfort. Sound quality is incredible for what they are, I just love how crisp the bass is. I use these for running and mountain biking, and they stay in my ears even in the fastest of downhill runs. After coming home, I leave them in while showering.

I've shown them off to curious coworkers and friends, and all of them wound up buying a pair! If these broke today, I'd buy another set in a heartbeat. But I'm not worried about that, even after a couple of drops they have shown no signs of stopping.

The battery did die on me during a 2.5hr bike ride. If you are worried about battery length, I'd check out that newer T6 model that supposedly lasts for 5 hours for only $15 more...

One important thing is that you can not use the same set for your phone and your tablet. They always fight to lock on. So I actually own this and a set of the SoundPerts. I USE the Soundperts for my Cellphone and the Tazo for my tablet. I hopefully this helps anyone out there looking for a good set of these. Dont get me wrong they are not bad for the price.

Exactly what I was looking for!,"I do aquatic exercise. I want music (or workout instructions) as I workout. I've had a few waterproof music players - for various reasons they just don't work out (stop talking to the computer to be able to switch music, not great sound quality, cumbersome to use, etc).

So I've been searching for a blue tooth earbud (or even headphone) that was  waterproof - something that I can put my phone in a waterproof case and play music or podcasts or books or whatever.

A friend had found one blue tooth ear bud - it came as a single earbud. She bought us both one. It works great for her - Not so much for me. And that is with us in the same pool at the same time going the same distance. I was beginning to think it was just me.

Then I found TOZO T10 - I LOVE IT. It has enough noise cancellation that I can ignore other things (even a class) going on around me. The sound quality is decent for the price point. It connects to my phone easily.

I love this product it fits so well!!,"I liked the cost for one I really did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a set of wireless earbuds and these were definitely worth it to buy.  To start when you receive the product it comes with a variety of buds that you can replace on the actual Bluetooth devices to fit your ear better, this makes it so almost anyone can use this as long as they take the time to find their size.  Secondly its sound-quality is very good it cancels out most sounds which I like for meditation and it can play music very loudly.  Next its Bluetooth range is very far, I can leave my phone on my desk and walk around the house while still listening to my music and enjoying it.  Lastly its battery life, whenever I go anywhere for the weekend I bring it to a full charge at my house and the battery on the storage container lasts me those WHOLE weekend without having to charge it again and I use it a lot.

"Good headphones, but they won't stay in my ear","These headphones seem pretty good in terms of quality, however they will not stay in my ears for longer than a minute, even using the smallest sized earbuds they provide.

To people who might think I am not aware of the different sizes of earbuds, I am using the smallest size.  I must have small ear canals, because I need even smaller earbuds in order to keep these from simply popping out of my ear after a short time.

No matter how good the product is, it really defeats the purpose if they won't simply stay in my ears.  I really like the product, so it's a shame I can't use them.  I am now having to purchase a different set with an actual wrap-around ear band.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice product for the price,"I've been using these headphones for a few weeks now and have enjoyed them.  Sound quality is good -- not Bose-like, but not tinny either.  Charging case is a nice feature.  Great battery life.  Did some yard work in the rain wearing them with no trouble, but probably will not attempt to take them in a pool or shower.

I have not experienced any of the connection problems noted in other reviews.  I don't power them down when I put them in the case, and I turn off the Bluetooth connection on my phone.  Maybe that makes a difference?

At any rate, I've been pleased with this product.  Just hope they last longer than some of the other wireless headphones I've bought recently.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product at a great price!,"After I charged the earbuds in its case for a short time, I very easily paired the earbuds to my phone.

Better than expected,"After a few days I'm impressed with these buds. Sound quality is surprisingly good for earbuds (though not good by any objective measure of sound quality, let's set that straight), and noise isolation on calls is acceptable. In noisy environments your first syllable will get dropped when you speak.

The fit was good for me, but not for my wife, it's about the shape of the ear not the size, and the right one would fall out of her ear. For me, 40 minutes of vigorous walking did not dislodge them at all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid Product,"Product arrived in solid packaging. The earbuds easily paired with each other and with all my devices.  Sound quality is awesome.  When I’m using my earbuds my husband has to talk louder to get my attention or for me to understand him...and volume is at medium low.  I just wish it has a volume control and can be paired to 2 devices at the same time. All in all though, I am very happy and satisfied with my earbuds!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Poor technology, badly ergonometric, falls continuously, but ok sound","I bought these because I was trying to find an alternative to AirPods given their excessive price. I totally regret it!
As soon as I put these TOZO T10 on, I realized that they didn't fit my ear very well, despite trying the different sizes. This became particularly bad working out - they kept falling in certain positions and when lifting weight. I started to work out without any music as a result. Now, one of the headphones (the left) failed completely.
In addition, the pause buttons are too hard and honestly, the fact we can't control the volume or to play the next song it's quite bad and technologically rudimentary.
Lastly, connecting my phone to these was a struggle. Often times I had to turn off my bluetooth, forget the device and pair it fresh, or the right/left connection would be lost...
In summary:  I do not recommend this, not at all!!!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Constant sound loss,"The built looks good the sound is good but I keep having trouble with the right ear piece it’s not charging correctly.  Every time I want to use only the right ear piece I keep getting a sound coming off of it like every 10 seconds, really annoying and makes it unusable. When trying to use the left ear piece only sound keeps cutting off and and it’s just unusable as well. When using both the sound is good, but almost every time there’s  head movement the sound cuts off. It gets really annoying.. like I said built is good and Sound is good.

Very good quality!,"The quality is good, it mostly depends on the fitting and the sizing of the buds. I reccomend trying the different earbuds that comes with these.

Great Headphones,"These are easy to pair to your device and they auto pair to each other.  (They even do a stereo check).  Just take them out of the storage box and they turn on and pair.  Watch the video to make sure you properly twist them in your ear.  I'm still trying to make it a habit.  And use the different soft bud sizes to find the right one for you.  It's a little different at first as they feel a bit big, but they have not fallen out while working out, riding a bike, mowing my lawn, etc.  The storage box automatically recharges them and has 4 lights to show how much charge is still left in the box.  So far I've used them all week without plugging in the box and I'm on my last light (1 of 4) of reserve power.  I have not used the headphones from 100% to 0% to truly test the number of hours you get on 1 charge.  You can pause music and answer a phone call with the button on the ear bud, but I don't think there is a microphone and you can't control the volume.  Luckily I have the watch that can change songs, change volume, etc.  So it's not a big deal for me.  Overall I enjoy the product and the price is great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great sound great price great earbuds,"I was looking to replace a pair of bluetooth earbuds that were tethered together which I found to be awkward.  These are completely separate and more comfortable.  I use them mainly for Audible books and secondarily for music.  The sound quality is amazing for music.  Bass response is great for small earbuds.  They are really easy to pair with Bluetooth on my iPad and to each other.  In fact they pair to each other automatically all you need to do not is take them out of the charging case.  The charging case is very well built and charges the earbuds quickly.  The case can be charged with the included usb cable or wirelessly.  The case is small and easy to travel with.  It’s actually small enough to put it in your pocket.  The case has blue lights to show the charge level and the earbuds have a red light that shows it is charging when fully charged the lights go out.  The earbuds were easy to fit to my ears.  They  come with several sizes and recommended that you try all of them till you find the ones that works best for you.

A good set of earbuds,"I bought these earbuds for running and doing yard work. The sounds is fantastic and they do a good job with noise cancellation while I’m mowing. They fit well and do not fall out even when running. I did have an issue with the left earbud because it would keep cutting in and out while running, which was quite annoying and threw off my pace.

"First venture into TWS headphones, not disappointed.","TLDR, fantastic value and performance for the price.

While I've only had these for a few weeks, I can see myself using them for as long as they last.
My biggest gripe with past wireless headphones, has always been the cord or band that connectes the two.
Starting with the Motorola S9 headphones ages ago, they worked ok but we're a bit bulky and the charging port eventually broke rendering them useless. Then the replacement S11HD's while much better to wear and listen to, we're also much more fragile and my first pair died from moisture from sweat while working out, and the second pair had them break the band right in the middle which rendered them also useless.
Finally I ran across the QY8's on Amazon a while back, and while they were on sale for $5 which is a absolute steel, they sounded much better and have our lasted all my previous pair currently. The main issue I do have is the rubber band that connects them together which while it is nowhere near fragile like the past headphones, it is a little bit grippy, and would continually loosen the buds out of my ear as I move around, as well as grip the back of my neck and pull them out as my neck gets sweaty.

In enters the T10's. My first venture into TWS headphones and while I question the validity of over 14,000 review, I figured for the price, these would be a perfectly reasonable first try. Well, for how good they really seem to be, they might be with me for a long, long while.
Initial initial impression is really good as the packaging is top notch, and all the parts feel high quality and well put together. The earbud itself is made of a sort of matte soft rubber that seems to be better at not sticking and collecting earwax like a smooth rubber, but still sticks and stays in your ear reliably especially being as they are two little buds that have to remain in your ear all by themselves.

Pairing is as easy as pulling both buds out of their case and waiting a few seconds, then making sure you find and connect to the TOZO-T10-R which is the Right earbud that acts as the primary device. Once connected you get high quality and virtually latency free audio with high quality sounds, and solid bass. Volume has a pretty good range and while they are not active noise canceling, they cancel out as much as expected with an in ear earbud which is still really good.

I just took them on a 4hr flight linked up to my Oculus Quest to watch Netflix on the flight, and the earbuds worked perfectly to completely remove you from the noise and overall presence of the flight and escape into vary own private theatre room. It was bliss.

The only downside I can address is the battery life was only just around 4hrs give or take. The storage case is a portable battery bank that should cover at least one full charge, and it does seem to recharge them rather quickly so this might have been a non issue if you give them 5-10 minutes to charge a little between movies or a visit to the bathroom, but I failed to give them a jolt and before the end of the flight I had one of the buds telling me that its battery was low. The curse of BT headphone I suppose but still in most cases I don't see this being a big issue.

The only other thing that I'm not sure is a negative as it seems to be a constant with most all BT headphones has been the little lite hiss that happens when there is low/no audio at a point, but the headphone is active to the device. They are completely silent when the audio is paused for more than a few seconds, but when you start any audio, the quiet part of say a song, you may hear a lite hiss that I believe is something that all BT headphones have when the connection is active. Once audio starts to play though, you won't notice and the high quality sound will fill your ears.

Overall I'm extremely happy I got the T10's as my first TWS headphones as they really exceeded my expectation. I highly reccomend them among the flood of reviews. They really are that good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Descent headphone with short battery life and bad call quality,I have had these headphones for a few days. The build quality is really good with good music quality.

Good headphones garbage charging case.,"Not sure if it's just my product but the little charging case is complete garbage and is completely useless as a recharging system for the headphones.

I use these headphones every time I go to the gym. I keep the headphones and case in the center console of my car. when I first got them I made sure that the case was fully charged so that it would charge my headphones after I used them at the gym. They get about 1-1.5 hrs of use every other day, so I assumed the case would keep them charged for basically a month's worth of use before the case would need to be recharged. After my first day of using them I put them back in the case to recharge and the case was at full charge. Two days later I got them out and the headphones were fully charged but the case was completely drained. I have tried recharging the case multiple times but it seems like as long as the headphones are in the case the case will be constantly draining. This completely defeats the purpose of having a charging case. It should only drain to the amount that the headphones need to be charged and should not constantly be draining. For a while there I was recharging the case every 3 days and only using the headphones about 3 hours in total.

From my experience these are a good pair of headphones with a good case for storage but has a useless charging feature.

Five stars for the headphones the 1 star for the case",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
IT WON’T STOP BEEPING.,"If you only use one bud at a time, it won’t stop beeping to tell you to put the other in. It’s so aggravating I could curse. Whoever wants to use two earbuds all the time?

Great Deal,"These earbuds are very well made, sound excellent, and battery life if pretty good considering the sound quality.  They are comfortable to wear once you get your right size ear piece which they come with 4 sets of different sizes, there not as heavy as I thought they might be which is a plus.  If you like listening a little loud like i do then good luck hearing anyone around you, i couldn't hear a thing around me when the music is playing which can be good or bad depending on your situation... The case is durable and has a magnetic locking lid which is very nice.  Has a strap to put on it if your into that.  The only problems i see with this is the cord that comes with to charge it is very short, but I suppose you really dont need a long one, and the rubber piece that seals the miro-usb port is a little bit cheap, i could see it eventually breaking off after repeated use... however i still think for the price this product is worth it, especially if you purchase on sale or have rewards points to burn... or both!

Stays in place when excersising.,"I have been using the headphones almost every day for about three weeks so far and they have been great. I use them when I work out. I typically run outdoors or on a treadmill, usually for a minimum of 25 min at a time. I did run 7 miles the other day and have not had any issues with them staying in place. They don’t move around when I jump rope or run. I have connected them to 3 different devices without any issues. Having several different ear pieces to provide a good fit was helpful. The sound from them is well balanced with a lean towards bass. Battery life thus far has been great and being able to charge them in the case is a handy feature. I have recharged them 3 times on 1 case charge. I dropped the case from about 3 feet up onto concrete and it was unscathed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super comfortable headphones.,"I bought these headphones for my wife. She has a busy job that she needs to be talking on the phone and decided on these as they look super convenient with the charging cable usb.

With Bluetooth 5.0, they can access a larger bandwidth than older headphones can for higher music and call quality. As an audiophile on a budget, I highly recommend these.

Not consistent - short shelf life,These buds were great at first but over time began losing their connectivity going from one ear to the next then stopped holding their charge. At one point I had 70% charge and in fifteen minutes died in the middle of a run. Let them charge overnight - only to 50%.

"Great for the price, but they do leave something to be desired.","These sound okay - they're definitely loud enough. I don't want to split hairs, 'cause these are fairly cheap at ~$50 - but... for me they're overly bass-heavy. Background though: I'm used to some (wired) earbuds that are audiophile quality reference headphones (MEE Audio Pinnacle P1's) - so if you're a bass-head & usually go for Beats by Dre or something like that - you'll probably have no issue with these earbuds.

Love the case & that it's wireless charging. They're nice and light & comfortable in the ear.

Another pain point for me on these though, is that they can only be 'actively' paired with one device at a time - meaning... They can't have two devices connected at once, and automatically switch between them based on which one is playing sound. I would've liked that option so I could have them paired to my phone & computer simultaneously...

But again - these are kind of a budget model - and for the price, they're more than what I wanted from them: a handy set of no-fuss/no-cords headphones that I can easily pop in for use when I want some headphones on when I'm using my phone: Playing games/listening to music while the wife & two toddlers are sleeping in the same room, etc...

These easily earned 4 stars, and are probably really a 5 star product when you factor in the price.

I did have some trouble keeping them in my ears  but I was able to deal with it. Not even a month into using them the left ear bud stopped holding a charge. I exchanged them for the exact same thing and once again they were awesome. Sadly, nearly a month later I had issues again. This time the left ear bud suddenly disconnected and went dead.

Very good audio and comfortable to wear,"I've been very impressed with this set of wireless earbuds. The audio has been exceptional with all the music and audiobooks I've used them with. I was a bit worried that the shape would be uncomfortable over time, but I've quickly forgotten they're even there most of the time. They paired with my Pixel 2 right away, and with one another without any problems. The magnetic snap-in charger box is very cool. The earbuds click into place and hold firmly, and start charging right away. The box itself has blue LED indicators to show how much charge is left in the internal battery, so it's easy to see when it's running low. One feature I didn't notice when I bought them was the wireless induction charger in the bottom of the case. If you have wireless chargers already, you can just set this case on them to recharge the internal battery rather than use the included USB cable. It's a very convenient feature to have!

"Solid product, Left ear bud cuts out...","I've read enough reviews to be able to give you a solid review of the product and the expectations for this product.  While the unit is very well build and a solid overall product, the resounding issue seems to be the hit/miss of the Left ear bud.  I did discover that the ear pieces can fallout without the proper size in your ear (I will chalk that up to the user since the company provides alternate sizes so you can find the best one for you).  The product in my case lasted 3 plus hours (which is better than expected).  The drawback comes back to the Left ear bud not connecting well (and to recap what others were saying, the phone would be within a foot or so from the ear buds).  If you happen to get a good pair that doesn't buffer, then your in luck.

A little confusion initially with the sound notifications (i.e. It will search for its other earbud if you pop in master and beeps for few seconds- some research helped answer - would recommend adding more detailed instruction manuel.

Otherwise great product so far - big sound and great value vs. higher price point earbuds and no quality.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than Apple AirPods,"I recently received my T10 Wireless Earbuds and I am extremely pleased! Originally, I was looking at buying the Apple AirPods, I have tried them before but since it is so pricey, I decided to look at other wireless earbuds and I am so happy that I found Tozo’s. I have been using the earbuds ever since I got it and I have used them in the shower, one of them even fell to the floor and it still worked! There’s a reason why these earbuds are so highly-rated! Tozo’s customer service is absolutely amazing too!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Make sure to try all earpieces!!,"I originally bought these to drown out noise on my bowling league.  They have not disappointed.  Manual instructs that you try all the earbud sizes, I agree, as you want a snug comfortable fit since there is no wire or wraparound holder.  Because they fit so snuggly in your ear and it samples out side noise, they block out a lot of excess noise.  The sound quality sounds clear and still has a deep bass profile even turned all the way up.  I also use them at work and only out one in.  They aren’t required to be used in tandem.

When using a Bluetooth headset for calls, the other person says is sound just like normal, only slightly quieter.  I’m buying another set for the SO soon.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Overall love them,"I use these daily at work and the sound quality is great. I don't really use the buttons and mainly control everything from my phone. Both the case and the earbuds hold a great charge as well. Only draw back is due to the design, they start to work themselves out of my ear after awhile so I wouldn't recommend them for working out but if your intended purpose is like mine you'll be fine.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Value for the Money,"I am surprised at how well the T10 wireless ear buds work. I got them based on a few articles that mentioned them as a good alternative to the expensive name brands that I can't afford right now. I listen to podcasts when I sew, and wanted the wireless so I wouldn't be tied to my phone, or have to deal with more cords. The noise cancelling function does a decent job of muting the sound of the sewing machine.  But I can still hear my husband so it's not perfect. I like that different sizes of rubber ear pieces were provided since one size fits all is usually a lie. The case is compact enough to fit easily in my purse or pocket. The battery life is just ok, but the charging case holds enough power to get me through quite a few podcasts. It doesn't take long to charge these little guys up. The little latch flap where you connect the charging cord is difficult to open at first, but it loosens after about 4-5 openings. The sound is clear. The range is really good. I'm able to get up and move around, or go into another room, and leave my phone on the desk. The customer service is good, too. They've emailed me a couple of times just to ask if I have questions or concerns about the product. Best Buy doesn't do that. Overall, considering my need and usage, the price point is excellent, and the quality is way above my expectations. I'm happy with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent ears buds...highly recommend.,"The product is excellent, great sound and looks.

"They do their job, when they're charged","I was excited to get these for the price. They sound good when you have them in and they do an ok job of noise cancellation but you can still hear outside noises when you're volume is any lower then deafening. You can use them individually while one is charging in the dock but they tend to get a bit sensitive and will beep at you for awhile, it will finally stop and you can enjoy your music. They stay in your ear pretty well but I wouldn't be to vigorous with them or they will fall out. I have not tested the waterproof. Battery life is pretty poor. From full charge to dead in about a week with little use. Honestly I'm not sure if that's norm for wireless earbuds but it can be frustrating considering my wireless headset will stay charged for over a month. All in all you can't beat the price but make sure you're charging them plenty or you'll end up with dead ear buds.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Comfortable and easy to pair, zero bass","Comfort wise these are great and pairing was a snap.  But the sound quality....I get absolutely no bass with these things.  I understand they're earbuds, so not expecting reverberating kettle drums, but a little bass (somewhat key to solid listening experience) is to be expected.  Got nothing with these.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Simple yet quality product,"This is our first time purchasing wireless headphones and decided to try earbuds.  The various earpiece sizes included helped my wife find the perfect fit, so that they wouldn't fall out in a variety of activities.  Sound quality is decent, even for bass in a small package.  With the snug fit and even with the volume only turned up slightly, it was difficult to hear any noise or be bothered by other background sounds.  Very happy with how is cancels out other sounds.  Thank you for making a simple yet quality product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds,"Great set of earbuds. Love the chargering box and how the earbuds are magnitize in place.

Great earbuds,Overall these earbuds are great. I was looking for some to use while doing yard work and relaxing outside. I also wanted some that were waterproof and these were rated the highest. This allowed me to go from mowing the grass right to the shower. The sound on these are fantastic. They have a deep bass are crisp clear. The only reason I didn’t give a five star is because they don’t have the capability of touching the earbud to advance to the next song. I recommend purchasing these earbuds.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I had to buy accessory ear buds,"I felt like I couldn't give less stars because the company has been incredible to work with! They have answered all of my questions very quickly. Plus, I think it's a personal thing as to these not working for me. I would return them, but I want' to use them to swim laps with, so I bought better 3 tiered ear buds made for swimming to use with these. These simply will not stay put in my ear, my right one especially. The other thing that I feel is missing (probably due to the IPX8 rating), is that you can't skip songs on the ear buds themselves. I've found others, but they only have a 7 rating, which means they can't be submerged. So it appears you can't have the best of both worlds.... YET...

Left earbud is useless,"Had same issues as everyone else especially the left speaker just going in/out to a point where it wasn’t worth listening to music etc. retuned it, purchased Jabra t65.

One of the best purchases among my running gears,"I recently started working out on daily basis and I was sick of the wired ear phones that would get in the way of my hand and arm movements. For the wireless earbuds, I initially was considering the airpods, however it's very costly and I tried them feeling not very comfortable with them in my ears. I searched online and found the positive feedback on this Tozo T10. Got it and put it on and immediately was fascinated by its sound quality. There were four sizes of rubber pieces to try and the smallest ones fit me. Don't forget to slightly turn them backwards so that they would fit snugly. Now I wear them every time I work out, morning runs, lunch time gym, and home core trainings. My husband is now jealous of me having them and he's asking for a pair!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Quality,"I have small ears and these worked perfectly for them. They come with three sized ear bud tips. They also are great for blocking out noise. I wear these at the gym and they stay in place. I use these for PC and phone and they work great. Sound quality is crisp and all music types sound good. I just wished they came with a carrying pouch because if you put them in the case they turn on and drain the battery, otherwise they are fantastic!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Impressed,"Initially, I was skeptical about ordering these earbuds, but after trying them for about a week, I've been pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is great and the bass is impressive. The portable charging case is good quality and built better than I originally expected. The lid for the case is magnetic and the earbuds are magnetic as well, so you don't have to worry about them falling out of the case. I wish the battery life was a bit longer, but they charge pretty fast. Battery life is about 3 hours for music and 5 hours for phone calls. All in all, this is a pretty good deal and I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a pair of affordable bluetooth earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound quality, Not for Swimming","Overall a decent product, just don't go swimming in these. I did and after 20 minutes, one earbud broke. Customer Service offered to send me a replacement in exchange for a review.

PROS:
Good sound quality, good passive noise cancellation, good battery life on the earbuds.
Case has wireless charging capabilities.

CONS:
Bluetooth - have to manually connect on the bluetooth app in your phone settings each time before each use.
Poor battery life of the charging case - only charges earbuds a few times considering its bulky size.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Love, love, love","I was skeptical about the bud thing, but I quickly came to like this item.  At first, the bud kept coming off, but when I changed the bud coverings to an appropriate size, the slipping stopped.

Quality Earbuds,"The Tozo T10 is very well made and quite impressive for the price. The packaging was well executed, and it comes with very nice features such as IPX8 waterproofing, Wireless charging, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0.

Pairing them with my phone was too easy. Take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing. With bluetooth v5.0 they have a stronger connection at a longer distance. The highs have very good clarity clarity and the bass is very rich. The ability to use the T10 for a little over four hours and then a charging case good for four full recharges of the earbuds is very nice. I have tried two other brands, both quite good, but the T10 are significantly more comfortable, and the sound quality is better overall. If you have a hearing deficit you can use the right earbud to aid in phone conversations. These are very nice earbuds, the price is great, and I will be using them often in place of my wired earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome Buds at an Awesome Price!,"After the umpteenth time of entangling myself in wires, I figured it was time to cut the cord and go wireless for my music listening.

I ended up purchasing TOZO after I saw the many positive reviews for it. My criteria came down to cost and quality for the price. After wearing them and listening to them for the past couple of days, I could say I'm very satisfied with the product.

The sound quality is exceptional. Clear, crisp sounds (depending on the music type) all coming from two tiny ear pieces. The noise cancellation is very admirable, considering again the small size of them. I haven't used them long enough yet to consider battery life, but they've been solid so far for my two-hour sessions at the gym.

The only quibble I can think of to mention is to make sure you select the right size ear cap for your ears. Believe me, this will save you a lot of moments where the earbuds fall out of your ears at the slightest tilt of the head. A proper ear cap size helps them stay snug and secure in your ears.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the product. Hope you enjoy it, too!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I’m not one to use earbuds quite frequently, but just walking by the case itself which serves as the home to the earbuds (which are quite sporty and slick, I might add,) I get an urge just to put them in and listen to some music while just walking around or listen to Friends on my iPad while cleaning! Couldn’t possibly be any sense of disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good head phone,Update Tozo contacted me and provided me with new head phone which worked much better for the mic portion.  I would give this tozo a 10 if I can for customer service and 5 for the product . The original ear phone had a problem with the mic it look like it was defective but it was quickly replace.

Give these a chance, you will not regret it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good product, but not worth the price tag.","I returned this product for a few these cons:

* Touch control - for something that is in your ear, you have to press the button way too hard for it respond. I used other in-ear headsets that a light press is all that is needed.
* connection reliability - I had the earphones less than 5 feet from my phone with no interference in-between and the connections will still pop in and out.
* Annoying blinking light - when in ear, the light blinks constantly which can be very annoying at night. Other competing earphones will only blink in ear if you are on a call which makes more sense than an constant blink.
* The earphones are the exact same form factor (not a plus) - because they are the same shape, it is possible to put them in the wrong ear. While this doesn't sound like a big deal for some, I feel I shouldn't have to closely examine the earphone for the L or R notation to know what ear to put it in. Plus, only the right earphone will automatically disconnect the earphones from your device, so its important to know which is which especially when you are in mono mode... and speaking of which...
* Mono mode - the earphone is constantly beeping looking for the other earphone. This is true for both the R and L ear piece, so Mono mode is a worthless ""feature"" in my opinion. It's incredibly annoying if you have to charge one side only but while you're listening with the other side, it is constantly beeping looking for the other side to connect to.
* Large case - While this case can charge the earphone several times and itself can be charged wirelessly, it is extremely large. other competing cases have half the footprint, but can almost have the same charging capacity.

UPDATED (7/23) I should have listed pros:

*Well made - despite the cons listed above, you can tell the product is made of high quality and will likely last long.
*Wireless Charging - The wireless charging worked flawlessly and was very responsive on the couple of different wireless pad it was tested on. Unfortunately, part of the convenience of wireless charges meant a larger case. For my purposes, while I loved the wireless charge, I would stick to cable charging if it meant a smaller case for portability. Granted, while still very portable and if you only owed this set, the case may seem small, but in comparison to other units I have used, the case was huge in comparison.
*Customer Service - The customers service is very responsive and even offered a replacement, but again for my purposes, the cons outweighed the pros, so the product was returned.

Overall, Tozo has a very good, well made product with great sound and (fairly unique) features but in this reviewers opinion, some there are glaring 'issues and build decisions' gives the set its current 3 star review. The 'issues' (I put issues in quotes cause it may not a deal breaker for some, but it is for me) can probably be an easy fix in a future version that would earn an easy 5 star review.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Performs well above it's pricepoint,"This is my first set of wireless iems, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I feared poor sound, poor fit, cheap quality, constant dropped connections etc. Turns out they are virtually the opposite.
I had them paired up to my V30+ in no time, adjusted the EQ to my taste via Viper4Android, and began to use them. These really sound fantastic, as it turns out, nice balanced tone, bass is solid and non bloated (these are not ""basshead"" buds, which I am very happy about) Mids and treble are clean, non sibilant, and the soundstage it pretty darn good. I love the case/charger, very handy to use. I will use these mostly at night before falling asleep, but the convenience of lying in bed without wires running to the phone is really nice.

Great sound quality.  Easy to use.,So I decided to finally try truly wireless headphones because my over the ear headphones sound great but I sweat too much with them on in the summer time.  I had a difficult time deciding which ones to buy because there were so many choices.  I'm glad I bought these.  They seem to be of good quality.  After finding the right size ear tip for me Ive decided they sound really good.  They have great full range sound with punchy bass.  I mainly listen to bands like Radiohead and Grouplove and in my opinion these are perfect for that type of music.  I plan on mainly using these for when I'm either at my home relaxing or walking around town and these seem like they will work great for that.  I'm very happy with this product.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They are working well for me...,"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

CONS: While they are ""waterproof"" they are not swimming earbuds. BT cuts out immediately in water. Could NOT use them during swim.

I received them on Thursday and today is Tuesday and they have been great all weekend.  I have not used them in a wet environment yet so I cannot speak to that yet.

Never going back to wired,"To start things off, I can say these earbuds are well worth the price, a good product to see what wireless earbuds are like without spending a fortune. I use them casually throughout the day and I can say I prefer wireless over your traditional earbuds now. Just taking out these compact earbuds and listening to music around the house without having to lug my phone and cord around is amazing. The battery life is pretty impressive, I have gone on Netflix binge sessions on my phone then put them back to charge without a worry, I've only gotten the low battery message a few times and hearing that surprised me as I thought the battery was gonna be an issue in these. As for the sound, it sounds great, just what you would expect from your music, the only issue I found with the sound is when listening to songs with many sounds happening at once in a complex way or organ noises make the audio sound broken. This isn't a big issue since a majority of songs are pretty normal so this is just a warning for people with specific tastes in complex music pieces.

A solid set of earbuds for a good price,"I was initially skeptical purchasing truly wireless earbuds for under $50, but besides minor connectivity hiccups (i've asked around and it happens to nearly everyone) and a weird popping noise in the right earbud while putting it in which probably is backpressure of some kind of waterproofing, these are the best earbuds I have ever owned.  They charge quickly, have great sound, and identify when pairing occurs during each piece of the process which is excellent in case there is ever a day I need to troubleshoot.

Originally, it was just the left earbud that kept cutting out, but now it's both at the same time, and it is a consistent problem.

Battery life stinks,"I will start with the good.  The case is small and is easily carried in even my smallest purse.  I usually have trouble with earbuds due to my ear canals being very small.  This comes with different size buds and the smallest one worked for me.  They are light weight and feel comfortable in my ears.  I don't run in my every day life so I am clueless if they would stay in for that but for walking and doing housework they remained secure.  Pairing with the phone or computer was super easy and quick.  All this was great but the battery life is terrible.

Here's the problem, when connected I start up my music and the right bud will usually work but the left ear bud will constantly cut in and out and sometimes not play anything at all.  If I even move my phone slightly they will cut out.  I can even sit still and it will have connectivity issues.  I think through a 1 hour workout session I can get consistent clear audio for maybe five minutes but the other 55 minutes I am listening to snippets of audio.  I have tried different apps, a different phone, and literally not trying to move at all which defeats the purpose of these earbuds but they will constantly produce jittery audio.  I've tried turning them on and off in different sequences and ensured that they were fully charged.  It doesn't matter if the phone is in my pocket or on my arm or right next to the earbuds on the table, they still cut out.  I'd really like a replacement if this isn't normal behavior but I tried to give it the old college try with these.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice ear buds,These ear buds work as advertised. They pair easily with each other and to my iPhone 7 Plus. I can use the only the right ear bud OR only the left ear bud if I want which is nice for driving. I watched reviews on these buds on YouTube before buying and I agree with the positive reviews. The only annoying thing is when using only one ear bud it beeps for a minute or so while trying to find the other ear bud to pair with. I understand that is somewhat necessary for these to function as advertised so it’s not that big of a deal. The longevity of the ear buds are my only other question.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Performance and a Great Value,"We have been using the Tozo T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds for about 1 month.  The sound quality is excellent and a great value at this price.  I use the earbuds for water aerobics and running and find their stated specifications to be correct (up to 30 feet and about 3 hours on a single charge).  I make one suggestion when using in the pool: the connection works better if your smartphone is positioned vertically (not flat) near the edge of the pool and not in direct sunlight. Their customer service was extremely helpful, and corrected a static/pairing issue I had initially.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Would buy again :),Great headphones! I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound. Might be better than my 100$ Sony pair.  Charging case is awesome. It supports wireless charging as well! Pairing is a breeze. They pair right up with each other and pairing with the phone is easy. The two colors are very stylish too.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality and connection!,"I personally love these earbuds. I work in an office that does not allow cell phones and I had no Bluetooth headphones that could keep a good signal with my phone from the break room. This is the first pair I have ever used that work with both the distance AND the interference with the office walls.

The sound quality is fantastic and they're super comfortable. I love them, and will definitely be recommending them to friends!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"AMAZING, EFFORTLESS EARBUDS. HIGHLY recommend!","I am so excited to write this review. I was on a SEARCH for wireless earbuds that works seamlessly and effortlessly. I am a pre dental student so I am always on the go and studying. I have tried many different earbuds and my biggest issue was the pairing method. I  didn't want to spend so much on apple airpods either so wanted to look for an alternative. These TOZO earbuds were so SO SO easy to pair (whether I wanted to use them for my laptop, ipad or phone). I usually don't have much patience or time on waiting for earbuds to pair but these does it so effortlessly that I am so amazed. The sound quality is also amazing, the charging case is adorable and I'm so excited to say that I love the wireless charging option.

I would highly recommend these earbuds if you're looking for a QUALITY product without wanting to SPEND so much money! I've been using these for a week now and I get so excited to study cause I get to use these TOZO earbuds! Thanks Tozo!! <3 xoxo!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Superb value,"This is truly a great set of earbuds. I used them for the first time today and they survived unscathed,  which is saying something.  I would have have paid double. I have purchased and gave away a set of 200 dollar Bose earbuds because they sucked, these far surpass them. Great value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Earbuds,"I had never considered buying wireless earbuds, as I was always listening to music in my car over Bluetooth. However, I recently got a new job that I'll be commuting to via public transportation so I wanted something to make my commute a little more seamless.

There are alot of options for wireless earbuds, and I dont regret going with these. For 50 bucks, the build quality of the case and of the earbuds themselves is solid and after messing with it for a few minutes out of the box, it pairs up to my phone within usually within 7 seconds, most of the time in less than 5. Can't go wrong. My brother in law has the samsung ones and I like these way better!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound quality and connection are solid,"Sound quality and connection are solid. Product itself is super high quality.  Really impressed with these given the price point. Hands down buy these!

Only con: once every other day it seems, they are a bit finicky to connect to the phone (Pixel 1). That might be due to the lack of Bluetooth 5 on my phone (product itself DOES support Bluetooth 5.

Call quality: a few people have complained that I sound distant. Honestly its 50/50... I think some people just need to turn there handset volume up as I tested this with a fried and could here him just fine when he was wearing these. Probably won't work in a super noisy environment (airport), but I love the freedom these grant to take a call while doing things around the house.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tiny earphones pack a punch.,"A well thought out product.  And,  they sound great.

Addition:  I have read some of the other reviews and wanted to make some points known.  While I have received the offer of a free wireless charger, by the time I received that offer I had already written this review giving it 5 stars. I have had many different sets of earphones/headsets from cheap to expensive.  These actually qualify as being inexpensive and for the money, fairly awesome.  The sound expensive and can't be beat for this price.

No, they don't fall out of my head but that is because I took the time to pick tips that fit my ears.  In fact, I always take it an extra step and get foam ear tips.  They may be expensive but my ears like them and they don't fall out.

I would buy these again in a heartbeat.  The sound great, and are incredibly convenient.  As I said previously, a great sounding product at an great price.  I spend at lease 8 hours every day with my earphone in my ears and these are just perfect.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
How is this possible for $50?,"If not for feedback of other persons, I would have thought this was gimmicky.  It is not and I rarely write feedback, but felt I should acknowledge this product.
These are great wireless earbuds.  Have to lower the volume because they have quite a sound.
The charging case, can also charge wireless by placing it on top of a wireless pad - can also charge via usb cable directly.
You can place the case on a pad and it charges on product that cost $50 bucks.

Huge! Beware! - Test the fit of the earbuds before you leave your home.,"I am a principal and I’m always on the go, especially at school. I purchased these earbuds on October 1, 2019. I only had them for one day. I didn’t know these earbuds were so big. I arrived to school with the earbuds in to tackle the day. They were working well while I was talking to my husband on the way to work. I stepped out of the car and disaster struck. My right earbud fell out in the school parking lot and a car ran over it before I could retrieve it! $50 bucks gone down the drain if this insurance doesn’t cover it. I wish I knew these were so huge! I hope the insurance I purchased with the product can resolve this issue. Ill keep my fingers crossed. I emailed them today.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Wireless Earbuds.,"This is a great wireless earbuds but the only thing is that if you stand far from your phone and someone walks by you, it cuts off the connection. Haha, but its overall pretty nice for such a good price. I didn't expect crazy high quality but I expected it to block out surrounding sounds and it did just that. Sits well on the ears and it comes with multiple ear piece sizes. I would definitely buy again.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Extremely satisfied,"I am very impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible. It has amazing set of features with very fair pricing. The bluetooth has a stronger connection with longer distance connectivity. It offers very natural sound with powerful bass performance. I use it while working out and I don’t have to worry about my the sweat damaging my earbud since IPX8 waterproof Nano-coating protects the earbuds and charging case from sweat or water. Pairing to your device is very simple and easy. All you need to do is pick up 2 Headsets from charging box and they will connect each other automatically. And then enter mobile phone bluetooth setting choose ""TOZO-T10-R"" to pair the earbuds. All set!!!

Excellent customer support!!!,"This is a follow on review to note the excellent customer support upon purchasing the heads related to follow up how they worked from the company.  Very friendly, helpful and focused on customer satisfaction.

So far, so good on calls and walking with them in.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome headphones,"I did some research and compared different models of earbuds that come in charging cases.  I personally do not like ones with hooks, so these are perfect for what I was looking for.  I have sweat in them while working and they have been wet in a pool and stood up to that.  I really like the wireless charging option for the case that was one of the biggest sellers for me.  The case itself is great and fits in my pocket easily, the earbuds ""click"" in magnetically which is great, because they feel secure when in.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase, sound quality is great, and paring was very simple.  Able to use one or both earbuds easily.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They fit great and stay put!,"I have only had these for a week but I am so far very happy with them. If you just follow the instructions how to put them in, they fit great and will stay put. They sound is good and the box is convenient and makes it easy to bring with you and not loose. They sound when you turn them off is a bit low so I have sometimes hard to hear if they got turned off or not, but that might have to do with my age :).  I use it when I do hit and put my phone on floor or desk while exercising, sometimes it does loose connection in a ear, but only temporary and for a short brief second. I am happy with them and hope these will last a long time. I sweat like crazy when exercising so my problem has always been that and that no earphones seem to survive that. We will see.. but so far I can recommend these!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Short term listening,"I like these buds but unfortunately the battery life is only about 3 hours..which is sad. I'm on the road a lot listening to podcasts, music, etc.
the Good: They come on and pair automatically when you pull them out of the case, Good sound, good fit.
The Bad: Pairing takes longer than i expected..about 90 secs to pair both automatically.  The battery life on these jewels suck...and this is a biggy for me...theyre now reduced to workout buds only.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
IF you are using these for calls... look else where.,"UPDATE: emailed their customer support regarding my concern and didn't hear back; its been two weeks. The customer is supposed to matter.
I work in an office, so if I get a call on my cell--its nice to be able to switch from music to my headphones without having to take something out to pick up. I would give these such a high rating, BUT because I got these thinking it would make it even easier answering calls while working--and its actually making it harder and more frustrating-- I will be returning. I can use my wired headphones to call and know people can hear me. Very frustrating. If these are just for music for you, then you will love them. The fact that you can use just one is great, so if you are out and one dies, you switch to the other while charging. I like that the buds just connect as you pull them out of the case. JUST FIGURE OUT THE MIC!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Sound and Quality for a Bargain Price,When I was looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds I came across these on Amazon. I'm really glad I did too. These earbuds are very comfortable and sound really good. The level of clarity and rich bass that comes from these is pretty amazing. I thought that I'd need to spend over$100 to get something that sounded decent but I'm glad I took the chance in these. Add in wireless charging and this deal is outright insane.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The Tozo T10 earbuds have loads of features found on more expensive earbuds,I am a very fussy person when it comes to listening to audio and tried 7 different brands and types but the Tozo 10 earbuds have great highs as well is very nice bass and cymbals sizzle. You will never get the high end out of the over the ear headphones like you will get with these earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sounding.,"It stays in your ear. Easy to recharge. As soon as you pop them out of the charger it reconnects to your phone. I really like that feature. The biggest problem is it picks up every noise in my truck and people can’t hear me that well. I mostly bought this for talking in my truck but I use it to listen to talk radio. The sound is very clear.

Built well. Solid materials. Magnetic earbuds so they snap into place in the charger. Batteries last 3 hours when I continuously talk or listen to podcast.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good for the price,"I have relatively small ear-openings and these actually fit quite comfortably. They likely fit better in terms of seating more within the average person's ears, but so far I have run around with them and no problems!!! I'm not sure if they would fall out with swimming (they suggest in packaging that they can) but I don't swim so it's hard to comment. I am however really happy with the sound quality!!! I actually feel the noise cancelling is quite impressive for this price range, and the packaging is great and so slim. Love them :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound quality for the price point,"This is my 3rd pair of truly wireless earbuds.  My 1st pair sounded great, but didn't have a charging case, so you had to plug them into a charging source whenever they needed charging.  So when I started seeing these new versions with a charging case, I was intrigued.  My first foray into this segment was disappointing.  The sound quality was simply awful.  No bass whatsoever.  With those returned, I stumbled upon these.  What a difference!  Solid bass (not over powering) and clean highs.  While these don't have a hook to hold them in your ears, they seem to stay put.  I replaced the silicone ear tips with memory foam ones and both the sound quality and retention seemed to improve.  If you want to rid yourself of cords and don't want to spend a fortune, these may be the earbuds for you.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Wireless Earbuds for the Money.,This could be my best bargain ever on Amazon. Purchased as one of the deals of the day after considering Apple wireless EarPods for over 5 times the price. Have now used for alomost 3 months and liking them more than ever. They link quickly to each other and my iPhone. The sound is amazing for the price...would be amazing for 3 times the price. Love the deep base...great when I am working out in a noisy gym or walking around my community. They fit perfectly in my ear....very comfortable. The charging case is great. Fortunately I had a wireless charging pad as a giveaway from a conference I attended. Charges quickly and case is good for 3 more charges. An all around great purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
not for calls,"I fully compared 3 Bluetooth headsets  this T 10 Headset,The OTium And 10 headset, and the LG 730 headset i use these for everything; driving, working out,  working in garage while making calls for all things listed.

TOZO T10
everything is as advertised except range
This headsetBuilt durable charging case is really niceThey feel comfortable in their ear. The sound quality seems pretty decentI can hear everything with good soundCall and listen to music and videos from both ears. For activities they stay in the ear they did not jostle around I do have rather large ears and was impressed by the fit.
However these are not for calls I sounded very distant comparatively to the other two Bluetooth headphones. Yes there is limited background noiseBecause everything sounded so distant. The range is rather questionable walking throughout a houseStraight line full battery you might reach before potential that they advertise. I wouldn't consider these noise cancelingHowever they do fit so snuggly in the ear comfortably they just block the ambient  noise.  One thing I did not like about these is Because it blocks the ambient noise I have to pull one out of ear Anytime someone is talking to me or want to hear what's going on around me.  The battery life is probably the worst I have experienced. As advertised you will get about only three hours of music n video. You can charge them in the case at least twice though Before plugging the case in.  when battery drops so does range and clarity.  Bottom line if I did not need to make phone calls and I just want to listenTo music  or videos for only 3 hours This is a solid choice.  I did not test water resistance  just sweet resistance was fine though
these are not practical for me

OtuIUM M 10
These headsets are extremely lightweight Can barely tell they hanging from your ear. HoweverIf you have to pull out the right earbud due to the placement of the volume And multi function button they we'll hang down and pull on the back of your neck.  Sound for music and videoIs not as Crisp the T10 However the clarity for the Person you are callingIs clearWith that being said that they can hear every ounce of background noise. From banging cupboards to shutting drawers, Fans were humming in the background. They will pick up all ambient noise but still be able to hear you.  they do fine for working out / running lil flops from the button piece but not bad.
the magnet catch is ok but not as awesome as they make it out to be
range was as advertised was able to go to the far side of my house from phone  before distortion 3 walls 30 ft or so.
so far this the one i will test further for durability

Lg 730
This headset was my favorite go too, it  is an older technology and a little bulky but has never let me down.  sound quality and distance is extremely comparableTo the M 10.  Due to its bulkRunning and working out makes this extremely floppyIn bouncing around on your neck. The battery life completely outperformed the other two. The quality of call for others Is right in line with the M10.  I haveFully driven this in rainWorking outThrowing it aroundIt is extremely durable And the battery will last 6-8 hours.  It does have a manual on off switch,  And the earbuds are held magnetically intoThe neck piece.  Comparably for the cost730 doesn't tube too bad of a job for old technology and cost if you can get it under 20 bucks.

I'm still searching for the perfect headsetFor multipurpose useAnd most importantlyQuality of callsFor the person on the other end of line. However out of these three.  the T10  will be returned and i will keep the other 2 for my needs",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are the BEST wireless headphones ever!!!,I have Sony noise canceling headphones 🎧 and these I think are better. I love the Phaiser headphones sold here on amazon for half the price. The Phaisers battery lasts longer for sure but these sound better and no annoying head wrap. I use the Phaiser strictly for heavy  fitness activity. I skateboard and gym lift akd aerobics exercise with these and they stay in perfect. I did swap the regular tips for foam since I buy foam tips in bulk and prefer to gross feeling silicone ones. The foam combo makes these super noise canceling even better than the Sony who supposedly lead the pack in noise cancellation. The bass is batter than the Phaisers and the highs are very clear and sound great. I have tried many other wireless headphones over the years that range in price from $19 to $300 and I can honestly say that these are the absolute overall best value and best sound quality and best in ear wireless headphones.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Alternative to More Expensive Wireless Earbuds,"As the title states, these earbuds are a good alternative to more expensive earbuds.  I use these mainly for watching programs while I work out.  Past earbuds would not stay in my ear, but I had issues with Bluetooth dropping.  These earbuds stay very well in my ear while I'm working out and sweating.  They are pretty good at blocking out all noise, but really only can compare that when I had to pull one out when someone was talking to me.  The sound quality when used on a Samsung phone and Samsung tablet was very good.  Overall, very satisfied with the quality, in case charging, and the wireless charging option.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great value and with the money,"These earbuds sound great for $50. There is minimal bass response. Other than that they sound great. My wife yes them while riding on the back of my motorcycle.

Better than I expected for the price.,"I don't use earbuds often, but while on vacation, I do a lot of walking and the earbuds that came with the iPhone kept falling out.  I finally decided to get a pair of wireless earbuds to see if they would stay in.  I didn't want to pay a ton of money either.  These earbuds have worked out great.  The smallest size ear attachment worked out best for me.  They feel snug and the sound is great.  Would recommend these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good little wireless earbuds,"Overall, this is a really good product. Once I figured out which size rubber adapter fit my ears, these have been awesome. You would have to be ok with things being in your ears like earplugs for these to be comfortable. Sound quality is really good with good bass and quality treble and mids. The only thing I would like is for the battery life to be a little better, but considering how small these are and how good the sound quality is even at high volumes, it is more than acceptable for me.

I mostly use them while running and they stay put in my ears and cause no discomfort. I would recommend these for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Believe the Hype,"After rolling through several reviews of the best budget earbuds out today and seeing the Tozo T10 prominently featured I decided to roll the dice and all I can say is... wow. For this price point, you will be hard-pressed to find a better out of the box bass delivery system. I have always used large tips for my earbuds but the added X-large tips take it up a notch. The sound is clean with punchy bass verging on thunderous depending on the fit/size of the ear tip. A snug fit is key to experiencing the full force of these little beauties. I am currently using memory foam tips that take the bass to that aforementioned ""thunderous"" level. Rage Against the Machine was finally able to rock on 2 small earbuds as heavy as they ever have on my home stereo. If bass is your thing, you just found paradise. And it's made out of memory foam.

Call quality seems to be good with the mic doing a decent job. I have had no complaints during calls. The lack of media controls is a bummer but pause, play, & redial suits the basic needs of the average person. Make no mistake, the sound is what drives people to the Tozo T10s. That's the reason I came and ultimately stayed. Any Bass-heads out there need to take a serious look at Tozo T10s when it's time to get new affordable buds. The bang for your buck on the T10s is fantastic.  Great Sound, Great Bass, Great price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No extra tips? Otherwise GREAT,"These buds are NO JOKE!  I am blown away at the sound. The bass really is rich and clear.  The treble could increased a little more but that is minor compared to the sound these things pump out!
Battery life is sufficient especially with the case being a backup charger.

My only complaint is that for some reason I didnt get the extra ear tips and the cord for the case.... I am using the tips that came pre installed which are ok but I need a size down.  Tried to find how to email seller but no link... Oh well. Even with that small issue I still gave 5 stars for sound and price!!

Overall these buds WONT DISAPPOINT!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds for under $100,"Very happy with these ear buds. Charging case is great quality and they sound really good. My only criticism (which is a minor one) is that I would like them to get a little louder. The good thing, however, is that even at max volume the sound quality is never compromised. Sound remain crisp and just the right amount of bass. I would recommend trying the various bud sizes to figure out which sounds and feels the best. I was surprised at the difference in sound quality when I switched the size. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
By Far My Favorite Wireless Earbuds On The Market,"Let me start off by stating I have tried just about all of the most popular wireless earbuds currently available and none compare to the quality of these. The most important characteristics of bluetooth earbuds that mattered to me most was: 1. range of sound, 2. durability, and 3. comfortability and feel for all day use. Oh and they needed to be able to connect individually and simultaneously whenever desired.  For the price range of $50, these were the only headphones that I found to meet all my expectations.

I use them mostly to listen to music every day while at work for it helps make me more productive during my blue collar work day. Between cutting wood and listening for my name over the loud speaker, I could get these earbuds to range from soft to outside noise cancelling quite easily.

As far as durability, they were the only earbuds that could withstand being dropped without breaking into a million pieces.  The construction and materials used are extremely tough and built to last for a long time.

And lastly the comfort of wearing these every day was far greater than expected. Literally everything about them I loved until I accidentally crushed one by stepping on it.  Thankfully, the customer service at TOZO reached back to me through email and clarified they were covered by warranty.  TOZO won me over as a lifetime customer and I will continue to keep purchasing from them and recommending them in the future.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good doesn't mean Best!!!,"Pros:
-great sound for music with excellent bass and a balanced equalizer.
-excellent for talking with good sound for person on other end
-syncing is good but could be better

Cons:
-battery life on the case is poor and had to be recharged every two days
-the buds are huge and bulky. There's a bit of heaviness that causes them to sag and not feel secure in my ear
-pressing the action button on the earbud requires such pressure that it pushes the bud into my ear and is uncomfortable!! I prefer a touch command like my previous pair

So far so good,"I have only had the chance to use these earbuds for two days, but so far they have been absolutely wonderful. The sound quality is awesome and it was extremely easy to pair to my phone. I have not had the chance to test out how well the battery life is but I like how the case charges the buds between uses. The only unfortunate thing is that the earbuds cannot control volume and/or change the song. In the scheme of things this isn't a huge deal for me.

First wireless earbuds,I was hesitant to switch to wireless earbuds due to battery life and wireless technology in general. I've had no connection issues and I've yet to run out of batteries in a day. Having the case handy to store them in and charge them at the same time is while not in use is awesome.

So Far So Good,"I've owned these for about a week.  Nice packaging.  The case is nice and seems to be well made.  Haven't tried the wireless charging yet.  The sound quality is great.

Note:  When I first started using them, I thought the sound was ok.  After playing around with the different sizes, I landed on the next size up.  Doing so totally changed the sound quality.  The bass hits hard and the sound quality sounds like its in your head.

On the first day I noticed that the Left side would cut in and out.  I was going to return them because it wasn't working.  I started using them at work for the past four days and it hasn't cut out once.  I don't know if it was fluke or maybe interference at my house.  I will try again at home and see if that is the problem.  I will update review if things start going downhill.  ""So Far So Good""",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"I'm hip, connected, and cordless.  I'm free and in touch if I want to be.",Been tied to my cell phone in travels and at properties I own.  Always in my pocket and can't dig it out in time.  These blue tooth buds have made my life less complicated and simplified.  Only had them for a few days and so only pairing with a few of too many devices.  Sound quality and voice transmission very good. Comfortable and do not obscure normal  conversation or sound.  Time will tell.

Earbuds are a great value,"I wanted some easy to use wireless earbuds for when I exercise - either in the gym or on a bike ride outdoors. I have worn them twice and I have to say I am pretty pleased.  They paired with my Motorola X4 phone right away.  I have had used them twice so far. First, I charged them on the previous night.  The next morning, I noticed that they seemed to be having some very short connectivity gaps when the microwave was on.  It was an odd coincidence, but it happened.  Then, I wore them to my gym and I was doing various exercises.  I am not sure why, but it seemed like at times the right earbud was momentarily losing contact with the left earbud as i tilted/crunched my way through the exercises.  It wasn't bad, but I was not expecting that.  My expectation was that these earbuds are only 6 to 8 inches apart between my ears so why would there be any problem? This morning, I wore them on a bike ride and I experienced no issues whatsoever.  On both occasions, I was also wearing my Fitbit Inspire HR tracker so there were at least two Bluetooth connections to my phone. I'm not sure if that matters.

I am going to continue using these for the next few days and will monitor the performance.  However, if these don't stop working and continue giving me a good experience, then I will feel it was well worth it.

Having the wireless earbuds is much better than having wired earbuds (so old fashioned, I now realize).  Thanks TOZO!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great ear buds for a great price.,I live these ear buds by Tozo. I've been looking to transition to wireless earbuds for about a year but didn't want to give up sound quality. I have tried my friends ear buds from other companies and found them to lack sound quality or be expensive.  When I saw the reviews for the Tozo ear buds I thought I should give them a try. I live them so much that I ordered a separate pair just to keep at work.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid pair of wireless headphones,"I bought this pair of headphones for my father, who wanted to join the wireless gang. The sound quality was pretty good with nice full bass. It did take some trial and error to find the best fitting position for the buds to stay in place. The battery life is pretty standard for these types of buds lasting about an 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  Overall pretty impressed with these ear buds and they are worth a shot!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Broken after two months,"EDIT: Just after a couple months of use, the left earbud has stopped working. Changing my review til this is addressed.

I got these because my old pair of earbuds were dying.

These are great for commuting in NYC and working out. They cancel out the noise of my morning commute and fit comfortably in my ear, thanks to the varied sizes of eartips they included with the buds. The sound quality is better than I expected, though a bit bass heavy. And I've yet to run out of battery - I pop them back in after my morning commute and they're fully charged for the gym later in the day.

Will update if anything changes, but these are great so far.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I highly recommend!!!!,"I was wanting to purchase another set of earbuds and had just ordered my son the Skullcandy Indy buds but really didn’t want the arm on them just wanted some that stuck inside my ear i has looked at several different kinds and came across the Tozo watched several reviews on YouTube as well as reading the reviews on amazon and decided on the Tozo and so glad I did love the sleek look, the magnet snaps on case, not having to turn on or off, multi charges, and the wireless option for charging.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"For People who Want Earbuds, but Can't Wear Earbuds","I had a really hard time with Airpods staying put. I live in NYC and was terrified to lose them in the subway tracks. When this finally came to pass, I decided a cheaper option had to be the way to go.

Get these!,"Dude this suckers a pretty good, there is a good amount of bass, sound canceling, great audio, phone calls work fine although the person on the other end says you sound a bit far away which is typical for a Bluetooth device. Quite durable I’ve dropped them separately and in the case like multiple times and still no cracks, scratches or dings, charges pretty fast, charge lasts, I wear these in the shower like everyday, so I don’t feel bad blasting my music anymore, it would be great if you could change songs by pressing the earpiece like you used to with Apple headphones. But overall worth the price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Has a few down falls, but great product","Great headphones. Simple set up and user friendly. The sound is great. They fit into ear easily. Not too bulky. Lightweight.

The only thing I do not like about these headphones is that you cannot change songs nor turn up/down the volume from the actual headphones. Plus my set did not come with extra ear pieces to customize the fit.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound great!,"I saw these on sale and said what the heck. Got a pair for me and a pair for my girlfriend who has been hounding me to get apple pods. When she saw these and got jealous I whipped out the pair I got her and she snatched em. We were both amazed by how nice the presentation of the packaging is, the materials, and most importantly the sound. Heaps of low end. She jumped up and down to see if they would pop out. They didnt. Even if they did they come with different size plugs. I love that you can charge them from the carry case suppposedly up to 4 times. I listened to these all night and they went strong the whole time. The case is magnetized so that it snaps shut and so are the buds themselves. They pop right in and charge. Pairing was a breeze. The case door is opaque so you can see the chargu g status. I notice on the white set, it wasnt as clear to see the status as on the black...at least in a lit room. I saved myself about 150 bucks since she is happy enough with these. She pretty much ignored me the whole night listening to her music with these on. As far as that goes, it blocks out a good amount of sound. I flushed the toilet with these on and I had to open lid to see if it really flushed because I heard zero noise so do t drive with these on listening to music. I find myself listening to more music because of how enjoyable these are.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Immensely satisfied,"This product did exactly what I wanted it to. I bought these with the hope that they would be able to do everything my wired earphones do, but without the wires. It very much satisfies these requirements. The connection didn't cut out as long as I stayed within roughly 8 meters, and I got the full quality of sound that wired earphones give. The battery time wasn't a problem at all, with me being able to keep them in my ears for up to 4 hours without any problems. The water resistance was also a big selling point for me, and I was able to take them into the shower without a problem. If they do end up breaking, the free 1-year warranty eases my mind. The case seems quite sturdy, and I have yet to have a problem with it. They were extremely easy to set up, and I would happily recommend these to a friend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great for the gym and the price is right,"Overall a totally decent pair of headphones, great quality for the price

Range: Adequate, although they start to cut out if I leave my phone on one side of the gym and walk to the far side.
Sound: Just fine, although I'm not an audiophile and listening in a loud gym usually
Battery power: At least 1.5 hours gets me through my workout, then they recharge in the case
Durability: So far no issues, IPX8 is nice but I haven't taken them swimming
Comfort: Fit nicely in ear.  They stay in well at the gym, but would definitely fall out during high intensity activity with a lot of head movement",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They're Chinese,"very badly built case for the earphones, they also make very irritating sounds while connecting or disconnecting. Sound quality is nowhere close to the bigger more well known brands, ofcourse you pay for the cost of R&D with bigger brands but I'm also questioning the safety of these earphones, how good are they for your eardrums in the long run? If you can spend a little more I say do that and get a better brand but for the price these are ok. Sound is not great either, they sound like chap earbuds, bass is really ghetto and not clear, kind of like a bass of a car stereo when your standing outside the car. good battery life though and these are not touch so don't be fooled.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
AMAZING HEADPHONES,"I’ve never really been sold on totally wireless headphones because I tend to run and jump too much while working out. Well I went on a limp and bought the TOZO 10 Bluetooth headphones and I did the craziest workout I could think of to make these headphones fall out. No matter how hard I ran, how many time I shook my head, they never moved an inch. Probably the best headphones I’ve ever used, and the sound quality is amazing as well. Will be buying this product again!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price! Customer service awesome!,"Ok. I got this product on super sale $39. Good deal. My first unit worked great but had problems cutting out and one side failed. I sent a message but for price expected, nada. But was pleaseantly surprised within a few hours I got an email..... Wow!! They sent a new unit out and got it 2 days later. Told me to keep the old one. Awesome.
Second pair has worked great and consistent for nearly 6months now.
The charger gives you about 2-3 charges at best. Full charge is consistent at 4hrs of music at high volumes. Eartips are good but after about 4hrs in the ear, gets uncomfortable. That's expected.
If your gunna compare these to Samsung buds or Beats? Those have more features for sure, but for the price.
Cons- might be a little larger than others when in your ear.
Pairing sometimes is often clunky. If your running or doing back flips they might not stay in your ear.
Pros- customer service was great, battery life, good fit that blocks out outside noise well. Comfortable.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for running,I use these for running. They stay well in my ears. They are very light weight and do not hurt after wearing them for a while. I like the quality of the sound also.

Good way to try out Wirelss earbuds,"I was unsure about the jump to totally wireless earbuds. I was worried id lose them, they may fall out while using them, they would be a hassle to connect, among other concerns.

Im happy to say that these earbuds have quelled all doubts.
They come in a convenient carrying case that also charges them, so losing them is not a problem.
I have use them at the gym with no signs of them falling out.
And the earbuds immediately connect with eachother upon pulling them fron the case. And connecting to the phone is no more complicated than any other headset.

Very happy. Would recomend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality.,"The sound quality is great for this little bluetooth earphones. Loud for this little package.
Pairing is simple, pick up both earphones and the left one will pair with the master right.

The wireless capable charging box is a great idea. After use, put it in the box to charge these earphones. It's always charged up when you pick them up. Smart thinking.

The only thing they can do to make it better by make the charging box a little thinner.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Bad noise cancellation, and poor anchoring connectivity","Earbuds do not  cancel noise, as well as there is an issue with how strong the connection between the two earbuds are when anchoring together, the slightest movement or angle can cause the left ear bud to tune in and out making their main use annoying at most points in time, especially if your doing any movement at all (or none in some instances I noticed).",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Quality for their price,"For the low cost of these headphones, I've been very impressed with their battery life, quality of sound (very good), and noise cancellation (very good). Charging is super easy and lasts quite a while. The water proof is great for when I'm walking or running in the rain. They are great for the gym, and won't fall out with any activities.

A great deal for their price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality,"I got these a few weeks ago and really enjoy them, they are easy to set up and sound really good. The waterproofing is a nice touch as well. Battery life seems a little shorter than expected but its not a significant issue. I did however suddenly have an issue with the audio on the right earbud suddenly becoming quieter than the left so I contacted thier support and they were fantasic, they had me reset them and see if it helped, unfortunatley it didnt but with the one year warrenty they offered to send me a new pair without hesitation.
For the price these are definitely worth it.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Value,My Bose Soundsports are falling apart after less than a year. After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give these a try. LOVE THEM! I use my earbuds mainly at night in the bed and like to fall asleep listening to podcasts and such. Being able to listen to one at a time so I can hear the kids is great. Gives twice the battery life. When one dies I switch it out for the other. They last a lot longer than the 3.5 hours it states. I get 5-6 hours out of them. They stay in all night as well. The wireless charging case is awesome and the fact that the case is wireless charging capable is even more awesome. I gotta say... for 50 bucks these are a steal. The sound quality is great also!!

Great earbuds!,When I first bought these I was really skeptical despite the great reviews but these ear buds are some of the best I have ever used. The sound quality is amazing.

Great Sound Quality and A Great Price!,"I have only had these headphones for about a week but so far I have absolutely loved them! I have never used wireless headphones before and decided to try them out since the headphone adapter for my iPhone kept on breaking. Because I did not want to spend the money on AirPods I decided to buy the TOZO T10 Bluetooth headphones. Best decision ever! These headphones are truly noise canceling and the quality of sounds is fantastic! I have only used them in the shower once or twice but when I have, I have not had any problems and can hardly hear the sound of the water running. I appreciate that they come with several different sizes of silicone to attach onto the earbuds so I can make sure the fit is perfect for my ears and comfortable.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works well!,"I wanted to wait until I used these multiple times before I wrote a review. I have used them to exercise, clean, run, sweat a lot and sweat a little. They work well with no issue.

So far so good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound,"These headphones are a great buy for the money. The sound is very respectable, the battery lasts a long time, they are not too big, they use bluetooth 5.0, and the case has wireless charging.

Overall these are a great purchase, especially if your not sure whether making the switch to truly wireless headphones is worth it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for calls ok for music,"Sound is great and wife says I sound good when I call her so mic is good. The rubber ear pieces have a light extra material from the molding process which hurt my ear so I used a bladed to cut it off. Distance isnt bad until something blocks me and my phone. Case and earbuds are great quality and they hold a great charge and the case charges fast. Nice feature with case charging the ear buds is the case holds them in place magnetically so they wont come out easily. Biggest downside is playing music, you cant skip, repeat, or control volume. Have not tested them in water yet. Would recommend them.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Recommend, with significant reservations","I've had these for nearly a month and a half now, and while they started out great, they haven't lasted.

Pros:
The fit is great. They come with different sizes of inner ear pieces, so you can find the one that works best for you, but I was fine with the one that came already installed.
Never had a problem with them falling out of my ears. Occasionally get a little jostled, but never a problem while running.

Cons:
Sound quality was great when listening to music/podcasts (at first), but did go in and out a bit.
Poor headphones for phone calls; the person on the other end complained that they couldn't hear me 80% of the time that I tried to use them.
Claim to be waterproof (able to use in the shower) but that only worked for one week before the left earbud was affected, and then another three weeks before the right one was. Sound is now muted and difficult to understand in both earbuds.

There's a one year warranty, so I may activate that to replace these. But I'm not sure it's worth getting a second pair. They may be good headphones if you don't test the waterproof claim.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Stunned and Satisfied,"I honestly was unsure if I would be able to keep up with wireless headphones but these have been a breeze. The battery life is amazing, I don't really have to charge them except for maybe once every two or three weeks but granted I do not use them often.

I already bought more than four different earbuds on Amazon, and definitely I can tell, this is the best one.

1 - The sound is amazing, great bass!!!
2 - It's real waterproof, I can shower with them watching my favorite shows, so my wife doesn't complain about the loud volume of the cellphone.
3 - They have magnetics, so, once you take them out from the case, they automatically turn on and connect with my cellphone
4 - Noise cancelation works well

problem with the left headphon,"Headphone looks really good and it does feel very comfortable when you put in your ears. Sound is great. I like the quality of sound too. So here is the sad part, when you are running or moving, the sound keeps cutting off in the left side  headphone.

These are great,"I bought these because I needed some new wireless buds. These so far are excellent. They fit well and come with multiple replacement ear gummies that vary in size from small, medium, large, and extra large.

The sound is pretty supreme for bluetooth buds too. There's a tiny bit of background static but that seems to be customary with bluetooth earbuds.

Earbuds Not Snug Fit,"Sound quality is good, but the fit not so much. They need to be more ergonomical to fit more snuggly for maximum sound quality. I feel like they can fall off anytime, especially when I am on the stairmaster. I fear one of the earbuds will fall into one of the crevices between the steps.

Both buds should immediately connect with my phone as soon as I take them out of the case.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality and finally rid of wires,"I've had these for about 6 months now and I love these.
No more annoying wires dangling around my neck.  And no wires needed to charge this.  The case itself charges wirelessly, and the earbuds charge in the case.  This means I don't have to worry about finding a charger that fits.  No need for lightning connector, USB C, Micro USB, etc.  This charges on any wireless base there is.
The sound is great too.  I admit I was worried when buying these because of the lack of wires - but the sound is better than my last pair of wired earbuds.  Definitely better than the sound from Airpods - too much noise is lost with airpods because they don't fit to the ear like earbuds do.
These can get loud too, if you want that. - I never turn them up all of the way because it can get too loud for me - and I like loud music - so they get loud enough.
Sound quality is great for the types of music I listen to - that includes rap, some pop, classic rock, metal like Metallica and Megadeth, harder metal like Slayer and Lamb of God.  It all sounds great.  I have Bose speakers in my car and the music with these earbuds sounds better than when I listen to the speakers in my car.
Customer service is awesome too.  Fast responding and proactive customer service team.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Small but Big Sound!!!,I am loving my totally wireless earbuds. I took them out of the case and they instantly connected to my phone.

Not working correctly after two pairs..,Unfortunately they Sound is great but they will keep cutting in and out.

Thought it was a defect and they sent a second pair but same thing. I have a pair of skull candy and they don't cut out at all but have the neck strap that connects the two ear buds.

Returned within three days,"I was hopeful that buying this product would be a positive purchase, especially with 10,000+ reviews and the majority of them being positive ratings. The product arrived quickly as anticipated. Out of the box, they seemed to be a quality item. I read the directions and synced to my phone and they played right away with no initial issue. Then I started experiencing intermittent problems with the left earbud, where the left one would cut in and out. This is not just a once of twice thing. It happened 40+ times in an hour or so. I tried in house, outside, in the gym, and yes, my phone (XR) was about three feet from these earbuds while this was happening. Remembering that the directions said that if you experience connection issues or static, you should shut them down and re-pair to your phone again. I did this and tried again. Same problem. I then tried it again the next day and the same issue occurred. The cutting in/out seemed to happen more often when the volume was turned up towards the max and even seemed to align with the bass in the music. Not sure if I got a bad one or if that is what was to be expected, pursuant to the instructions in the box which talk about static and connections issues. Disappointing.. Just dropped them off to be returned.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Excellent earbuds!,"I'd give these ""TOZO T10"" earbuds 4.7 stars if I could.

(I didn't get paid for this review, and I didn't get the earbuds for free.)

The only major drawback I can see is the audio/video delay (lag) that I get on my laptop.

I originally bought these in an attempt to find bluetooth earbuds that didn't stick way out of my ear, had decent bass response, and most importantly, didn't have the infamous audio/video lag when watching on my laptop.

The good:
-Comfortable in my ear
-Sound is great (TONS OF BASS)
-Battery pack and ability to charge the earbuds is nice

The ""needs improvement"" section:
-The audio/video delay (lag) is still there!
-Stcks out of my ear a bit, but not too bad

Overall, the earbuds are really nice! I am searching for another pair though, due to the audio/video delay (lag).

I tested the audio/video lag by watching videos on YouTube and videos on my laptop. I have a Bluetooth 5.0 card in my laptop, so I don't think that's it, but I could be wrong.

I also tested the music/bass response with the following songs:
-Eye of the Tiger (Survivor)
-Danger Zone (Kenny Loggins)
-YMCA (Village People)

The bass is really amazing, so I'm keeping these as my ""control"" set. I compared these to the ""Audio Shockerz"" pair that I just bought, and the sound stage and the bass in the ""TOZO"" is quite a bit better, so I'm returning the ""Audio Shockerz"".

If the audio/video lag wasn't here, I'd say these earbuds would be nearly perfect. And waterproof to boot!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality buds and charging case!,I really like these ear buds! I finally decided to splurge on a good set because I wanted to be able to watch my digital media in noisy places and I wanted more freedom to listen to media when I am working out ... and I sweat a lot! They sound great and don't appear to be affected at all by my sweat. I also like the various cushion sizes that come with them. The wireless charging case is awesome and well constructed.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for small ears and cord-free listening while working,"Typical earbuds do not fit/stay in my ears. I apparently have small ear canals. These come with a few different size plugs that go in your ears. The smallest size still doesn't fit correctly in my left ear but it fits well enough for my purposes.

While doing farm, landscaping and construction work or simply chores around the house, I can comfortably wear these without cords getting tangled in plants or tools.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product,When I first used this items I noticed some problems w the charging case and or buds.  I contact the customer support/ manufacturer and they quickly made things right by sending me a replacement.  I was unable to write a fair review of these buds because they were defective.  Now that I recieved the new buds the case charges really quickly and it also charges the buds quickly as well.  Sounds quality is amazing for such small buds. The bass quality is surprising as well.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I am glad I got an exchange instead of a refund.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Too bulky, not good for running","I was looking for something for working out and running. These keep falling out due to the weight and bulkiness of the product. I returned them. Travyna headsets are pretty good, no bass but loud enough and they don't fall out of your ears while running.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Easy to set up, charge on the go and sound great!","I received these two days ago as promised.  I was surprised to find them already charged and ready to go.  They fact that the case not only is a charger but essentially a power storage device is amazing! I was very happy with the easy of set up and the quick start guide. First time out of the box my ear buds did not pair correctly. Following the guide, I quickly did a reset by holding each buds button for 15 seconds, put them in the charging station for a few seconds, removed them once again and they paired instantly!

The buds themselves fit comfortably and sound amazing. They are the perfect solution to my new phones lack of generic audio out jack.  As I travel frequently, I love that they recharge in the case without the need to find a outlet between planes!!  I’ll miss my big name, large over earphones, but paying 6X the money to move to their wireless version just didn’t make sense.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
LOVE these earbuds!,The state of TN has recently enacted a ban on using your cell phone while driving.  I used to use a single airbud and was dissatisfied with it.  I ordered the TOZO ear buds and I LOVE THEM!  They fit in my ear perfectly and the sound quality is absolutely amazing!  I'm going to be making a 1000 mile move and I can't wait to use these!  I definitely give this product 5 stars! *****,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Wire-free, trouble-free","So far so good! I've only had the headphones for a few days now, but the sound quality is great, they connect quickly to my phone, and they are comfortable for my ears. I love having wire-free earbuds. The one thing that's weird so far is that if i just listen to the headphones for an hour or less, if i put them back in the case to store, it uses up one of the charges. Not a big deal, though. Still need to test the phone mic!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Complete disappointment,"The product is completely not answers the expectations. And here is why: Its pairing period is somewhat 10-15 seconds. And its every time you taking them from the charging box. So, if you have a phone call and you wish to take it with your charging Bluetooth earbuds - there is no chance. Second, you cannot charge master earbud (right one), while using left one. Once you put the right one to charge both are disconnecting from phone. Next, play time of 3.5 hours is the same as idle time (out of charging box). So even if earbuds are not in use, but also not charging - they discharged in 3.5 hours. Solution is to hold them in the charging box, but in this case you will need 10-15 sec to pair them again... Also faced some strange disconnection of left earbud if it being put away from the right one even for the 3 ft distance (placed right one in the pants pocket, while left was in my ear). Another issue is microphone. Seems that only one mic is working on the right earbud, but if it on - people on other side can barely hear you talking. Not sure if left mic is exist and if yes, it wasn't working for sure (tried to speak into it and it wasn't any better). So, forced to use left one to listen and right one to speak. Not really what i was expected. Forced to return the product.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pros and cons,"I’ve had these for a week now. Sometimes the pairing is difficult, when I’m working I can only wear one side. Sometimes the ear piece that is in would beep for a while making you think that it can only be worn with both pieces in your ears. On the plus side, they do not and will not fall out . Though, feels like My ears are popped with them in, same feeling as when an airplane takes off. The mic for when you speak during a phone call is much better quality than AirPods, says my wife. I tried  AirPods before this purchase but they continuously fall out of my ears. I’m a grown man by the way",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best I've gotten so far at a great price,"These are great! I got an adapter that so I can use them with my Nintendo switch and they are killer. Audio quality and battery life were what I was looking for, and these have both in spades. The case is slick as heck too, and the company included a warranty ND was highly responsive to me when I had a question via email
 Good product! Hopefully it stands the test of time.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Work great!,"I really like how discreet and powerful they are, not to mention how adjustable! they charge plugged into my laptop conveniently. Ive had mine for a few months and I think the battery life could be improved. it only lasts an hour of consistent use and the strap it comes with loosens way to easily.  I removed the original strop and replaced it with a lanyard strap. One other downside is that you cant just have one in your ear and the other in the charger; if one goes in the charger they both disconnect from your phone. As for its waterproof ability, i cant speak on that bc I haven't dared to test it. I originally bought these wireless earbuds to use when I cleaned and closed a restaurant I worked at and I still use them daily. I recommend these for anybody looking for affordable bluetooth earbuds that will fit great!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality - nice for the money,"We'll see how long the battery lasts over time, but for the money these are great.  They fit in my ear well and are not too heavy.  The sound is great, could be a little louder....but overall really pleased with these - based on how much they cost.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A couple critical issues compromise an otherwise good product,"The Good: Audio quality is excellent.  Great bass and mid range.  The case is nice and the ability to continually charge the buds while they are being stored is great. Did not really use long enough to test the battery life.

The Bad:  Audio kept clipping in and out when I had my hone in my pocket, when I was walking, or whenever the phone was more than a couple feet away.  This is a huge issue as I use the earbuds while exercising all time time.  The limited BT signal range made these earbuds effectively useless.  I know it is not my phone because my previous BT earbuds did not have any issues with range, and a newer pair I purchased after trying these out also enjoyed excellent range and no signal loss issues.

Also could not get these buds to seal inside my ear well regardless of which size earbud I used.  Especially when working out and sweating, these would always work loose and never form a tight seal.  This always lead to a compromised audio quality.

Will be returning these earbuds.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I was in your shoes! Read review :),"I’ve had these head phones for about 2 weeks now. I’ve been searching for a good pair of true wireless head phones that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. Since buying them I’ve used them for movies on my tablet, YouTube videos on my phone and music at the gym. I was skeptical about the gym but they hold up nicely! I don’t really ever write reviews but these head phones are worth a review!
The reason why I give them 4 stars is because I found that when I use them at work and I’m walking around (with my Bluetooth devise in my pocket) it would occasionally cut in and out for a few seconds. I’m not entirely sure why this is. I ended up getting the 4yr protection plan on them so I’m not to worried though!

Pro:
-Battery life is great for an 8 hour work shift (the charging box is portable and very convenient!)

-I was worried about video quality having a delay with voices matching the mouth. THERE IS NONE OF THAT :)

-music quality is rather nice. If you’re heavy into bass quality this might not be for you. But for the average person the quality is perfect.

-the price is a bit of a pinch but not to bad compared to other wireless headphones

Cons:
(2-19-19)

-while walking around at work with my BT device in pocket they seem to cut in and out for a few seconds. Not sure why this is.

-easy to loose/misplace if you’re not careful",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good, cheap alternative","These earbuds are a great choice for those who don't want to spend a ton of money but still want quality wireless earbuds. They pair pretty easily and the sound is good (at least to my standards). They definitely cancel out noise. I don't know if I just have small ears but they are a little bulky. Strangely it helps when I don't wear any rubber thing on them. Their charge is good and they charge fast in their case.
Overall, would recommend!!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, great customer service,  issue with hearing while on phone.",The headphones themselves were great they had a great fit they also have a great sound the only issue I had was that during one of my call's the right ear Bud the master 1 decided no longer to play any sound during the call so the person on the other line could hear me but I could not hear them when I connected the left ear bud I was able to hear the calls find the media still plays with that is 1 issue that I have made phone calls.  The customer service is also very good they were very prop in helping resolve my issue and sending me a new pair,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unexpectedly Bada$$ Headphones - UPDATE - 5-Stars to 2-Stars unfortunately,"I was hoping these would be at least as decent as my JBL or Apple headphones - but, wow was I underestimating these. Never heard of this brand (TOZO), and I'm always skeptical of overly positive reviews, but I literally can't find one thing wrong with these. While you can't control anything physically on the ear pieces, they do have built in mics for bluetooth, handsfree talking, and you can control the volume and sound FX when connected to your phone or device. What's most impressive is the bass these little things produce. I feel like I have a subwoofer in my head. They fit super snug, and cancel ambient sound better than any headphones I've owned. I truly hope these hold up. A+++++++

UPDATE REVIEW 7/31/19:
While these do sound pretty great, they do manage to have a few irritating qualities. You can't control the volume on them, but that doesn't especially bother me because you control it on your connected device. What bothers me is there is no on/off button, so these things are on and auto-connected the moment they come out of their charging case.

The headphones have to connect to each other. You'll hear a voice say ""second device connected"" - at first I thought that meant I had connected to someone else's device, but no... connection 1 is the left headphone, connection 2 is the device. When the headphones aren't paired to a device, they have a little chirp that goes off about every 20 seconds, which is extremely annoying. What's worse, is now mine won't stop chirping at all, whether connected or not.

Now to the absolutely biggest design flaw in these - the microphone. I bought these for hands-free convenience. But if you are outside in the slightest bit of wind, or in a Starbucks or anywhere not in a closed, quiet space, no one can what you're saying. The microphones are on the outside facing part of the headphones, so they aren't even directed towards your mouth. This is a huge issue and I am returning these as this particular flaw completely defeats the reason I bought them in the first place.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic deal,"These wireless earbuds are a great value for their price. I was surprised with how good they sounded considering the price.

These are outstanding.,These ear buds are outstanding quality for very little money.  They pair automatically.  The battery life is about 4 hours.  No interruption.  Great sound.

Very nice for the price,"Here's my quick opinion: I'm a 45 year old guy, no audiophile and I wanted something cheap to use with my tablet so I could watch shows while in waiting rooms and sitting around.  These are perfect and I love them.

Here's more detail:
From the description page these Tozo T10 look a little cheap as well as the case. They are not at all. They seem very durable, the case is heavier than it looks and has 3 very strong little magnets that hold the lid shut. I thought the lid would be thin cheap plastic, but it's actually quite thick and seems sturdy. I take the whole case out of my work lunch box and toss it on the bed so I can charge it later and it stays shut. I even tried grabbing the case by the sides, and shook it, trying to get it to open and get the earbuds to fly out. They wont. Impressive.
Wireless charging works great.
The sound quality is great from these. Like I said, I watch movies on a kindle and using only 1 earbud, I have the  volume at about 75%. If I were to use both, I would be good at about 50%. I won't say these are extra loud, but should be plenty loud enough for most people.
So after having these for a couple of days and using them, I am very, very happy for what I got for the price. As long as they last a while, they'll be perfect. I would definitely buy again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pleasantly surprised,"These earbuds were listed as Amazon‘s choice. They have been reviewed by over 10,000 people including myself now. I have used Apple AirPods for a couple of years now but I have started having issues. I didn’t want to spend buchu‘s of money  replacing my AirPods. I found these and thought to myself 50 bucks not bad I’ll give it a shot especially with Amazon’s return policy. Long story short I am pleasantly surprised with how well things sound the connectivity is easy no issue.  I would highly recommend these truly wireless earbuds for anyone needing to listen to music while working out or working in general. I have use them to make a phone call and they work well for that also. If I was being completely honest the only downside is you need to be in a place with not a whole lot of noise because they will pick it up. In other words when I use them at home I can talk on the phone fine, when I use them at work people have a hard time hearing me because of the background noise. Overall I am surprisingly satisfied for the price point and I plan on buying another pair for my wife.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Will def be recommending to everyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Do not buy!!!!,Very disappointed! Saw so many good reviews and was excited to try them. First the buttons on the earbuds are very hard to press. And second and most annoying is that it disconnected on its own every couple mins! Doesn’t matter what one doing or how close or far im from my phone it always disconnects! So having to reconnect constantly in between calls or music is very frustrating!!!!!  Honestly going to return them and get the AirPods !,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
EXCELLENT customer service,"I initially bought one pair of Bluetooth headphones from Tozo, but I lost one of the buds. I contacted them and they offered me a nice discount on a second pair, even though dropping the headphone out of a car is obv not covered by the warranty.

Great headphones and company but not sure how water resistant they actually are.,Recently bought these and was really happy with them but the left ear bud went out completely after being exposed to water.

Excellent sound and good battery life.,"I decided to give these Bluetooth wireless earbuds a try after my old cheap pair broke. This is my first pair of earbuds that lack any wires, and I was very impressed by the sound quality. The bass  is excellent and they give you a lot of volume to work with.

I love these buds!,"I’ve been wanting some Bluetooth buds but the airpods don’t fit in my ears well. After looking at dozens of options on amazon, I settled on these and am very happy with my purchase.
They arrived well-packaged the next day. Both the charging case and buds themselves feel like good quality items. They paired quickly to my iPhone with zero problems. The sound is quite good, perhaps a touch bass-heavy, but most casual listeners like it that way. Would definitely purchase again. They stay firmly but comfortably in my ears.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These earbuds make constant popping sounds with music that has ANY treble,"The monumental cons: I knew as soon as I put these on they were trash. As soon as I queued up some test music, the popping began. Go ahead, try it with any music that features trumpet such as Stan Getz or electric guitar such as Metallica's And Justice for All. These earbuds can't handle high treble sounds to save their life. Period. I'm avoiding all earbuds in this price range for now as they all seem to be of poor construction. The pros: Good punchy bass and noise cancellation.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Doesnt work well for mowing lawns.,"Thought they would work for mowing lawns. I have one that is 2.5 hrs long and one that is 4 hrs. The ear buds have done fine for awhile but after 3 months of use I cant make it through my one lawn that is 2.5 hrs long anymore.

Another problem is i cant have my phone in my back right pocket. They connect but cut out frequently.

When working with phone 3 feet away from face they are great.

Sound quality is mediocre at best",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent earbuds for the price,"In fact, they are excellent when compared to all other earbuds.  This is from someone who really dislikes all earbuds, due to the mediocre bass quality, and most annoying of all, the two stereo channels separated by the width of your head.  The Tozo buds can't solve the latter problem, but they do have good midrange quality, and bass is as good as you will find in earbuds of this size.  Highly recommended.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comparison: TOZO T10 vs BEBEN 5H,"I purchased both the BEBEN 5H wireless ear buds and the TOZO T10 wireless ear buds, for use with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Android phone. Prior to these purchases, I have been using Anker bluetooth (wired-to-each-other) ear buds; the Anker buds have served me well for a couple of years, but I was looking for truly wireless for a couple of reasons (I won't waste your time with those reasons--I suspect if you read them you wouldn't care).

I checked out reviews and ratings for several brands, and settles on these two:
-- BEBEN 5H Continuous 25H Cyclic Playtime IP68 Waterproof 5.0 Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds with Wireless Charging Case (here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PN2FK2W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-- TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds with 【Wireless Charging Case】 IPX8 Waterproof TWS Stereo Headphones (here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J2Z5DBM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I purchased the TOZO first, after reading many positive reviews, and seeing an average of 4.4 stars from more than (at the time) 9,000 ratings; the price was $49.99. Afterward, I noticed the BEBEN, getting an average rating of 4.8 stars from over 1,000 ratings; these were slightly less expensive, $45.99. I liked the controls advertised for the BEBEN better than those advertised for the TOZO.

Both sets claim IPX8 waterproof certification, which means they can be dropped in 3 feet of water and should be good to go. (Interestingly, IPX8 *does not* mean all of the lower IPX ratings are covered. For example, IPX6 means it can handle a spray of water at some amount of pressure; being rated for IPX8 does not mean it passes the IPX6 test.) Both are bluetooth. Both advertise good music sound quality, and good use for phone calls.

When I received them, I decided they must have some common manufacturing. While the shape of their cases is different, there are some notable elements in common: Both have four small LED lights in the case to indicate the case's battery level, both cases close magnetically, and they come with identical graphics and text materials to communicate they're good for swimming (surface, not underwater) and good for showers. The TOZO advertised that it came with 5 pairs of different sized silicone cups to fit different sizes of ears, and it did; the BEBEN advertised that it came with 3 pairs, but it came with 5. Both cases charge wirelessly, and both cases can recharge the ear buds multiple times before needing a case recharge.

I put both sets through the same test routine. I listened to similar music, and I made phone calls. With each set, I ran 4.5 miles on a treadmill, then showered while wearing the ear buds and listening to podcasts. When I was in the shower, the ear buds were connected to my phone which was about 25 feet away with 2 walls in between. Here are my findings:

SOUND QUALITY:
I found the sound quality to be very good in both. I'm probably not as demanding in this area as some, but I would guess I'm as demanding as most.

Score: tie

SOUND BLOCKING:
Neither set has active noise cancelling. They block noise through their physical design; the silicone cup which fits into the ear canal physically blocks a lot of environment noise. I think both do brands do a fine job of blocking environmental noise, so the music sounds good.

Score: tie

CONNECTION STABILITY:
One complaint I'd read a few times regarding the TOZO was dropped connections. When I tried the BEBEN, as I got around 25 feet from my phone, with 2 walls between me and my phone, on a couple of occasions both ear buds disconnected, then reconnected very quickly; each disconnect-reconnect lasted maybe half a second. It was a little annoying, but rare, and pretty understandable given the distance and walls. The TOZO did the same thing. However, the TOZO did the disconnect-reconnect routine many, MANY times, including when the phone was only 3 feet away and there were no obstructions between the phone and ear buds.

Score: BEBEN 5H wins

CONTROLS:
The BEBEN 5H's buttons offer more controls than the TOZO T10's. The TOZO's controls include:
- Answer phone
- Hang up phone
- Redial last number
- Play/pause
- Reject phone call

The BEBEN's controls do not offer 'redial last number', but otherwise have the same controls plus:
- volume up/volume down
- next/previous (song, podcast, etc.)

Score: BEBEN 5H wins

FIT:
The fit was very similar between the two. The TOZO are slightly larger (as seen in one of the attached photos). Both stayed in my ears while I ran 4.5 miles on a treadmill. Neither the shaking nor the sweat led to ear buds coming loose.

Score: tie

PHONE CALLS:
For me the sound was good. I was told by my daughter that on her end I sounded good. In the initial tests, I found no difference. Since the initial testing, I have used the BEBEN for phone calls on many occasions; on a couple of occasions I have been told by the person at the other end of the call that they could not hear me well. I don't have enough information, yet, to decide whether that was because of the environment I was in at the time, or if there's some flaw in the BEBEN mic.

Score: tie

WATERPROOF:
Both sets survived my shower with flying colors. They performed fine. It was nice to keep listening to music or podcasts while I was showering. In each test, I removed the ear buds while I was in the shower (so I could clean my ears), set the buds on the bath tub rim, then put them back in my ears about a minute later. No problems with regard to water.

Score: tie

OTHER:
These two things are small, but I notice them. First, the TOZO case lid is slightly translucent. Because of that, when the battery level LEDs are lit, they can be seen through the case lid, which is nice (this is shown in one of the pictures); the BEBEN lid is completely opaque, so the LEDs cannot be seen without opening the case.

Also, as seen in one of the pictures, the ""L"" and ""R"" on the BEBEN ear buds are small and low-contrast with the surrounding plastic. For a 54-year-old who needs reading glasses but who otherwise has good vision, I wish they would have made these markings easier to see.

Score: TOZO

SUMMARY:
The BEBEN 5H are very good. I'm glad to have them and will make great use of them. The have the added benefits of offering additional controls over the TOZO, which I am glad to have, and they are slightly cheaper.

The TOZO are pretty good, but that issue with disconnecting and reconnecting is very annoying. This is something they should fix. As can been seen in other reviews, I'm not the only person to find this problem. This set will be going back.

great alternative to air pods and good for running,I wanted wireless earbuds that would last but air pods don’t fit in my ears right and are also too pricey.

The only features they left out - that you can get at 4 times the cost of these, are better controls. They turn on/off and answer/hang-up calls, that's it.

Definitely NOT WATERPROOF,"I already have an excellent pair of earbuds, what I was looking for was a pair of EarPods that I could swim with. Based on the reviews, I thought I had found such a pair with the Tozo T10. Unfortunately, the moment my head went under the water, these  earbuds lost connectivity with my Apple Watch and ceased to work. Presently the left earbud doesn’t work at all. This is all from a brief moment of submersion. These earbuds sound very good, but you can find equally good sounding buds for less money. If someone knows of a pair of earbuds that can actually be used to swim with, I would love to know about those. I can say without hesitation, that these are not the earbuds I was looking for",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Battery life,Love these headphones. They fit great in your ear An does not easily fall out. Also the bass is pretty good An battery life is good also since I have purchased these I haven’t charged them in two days An fully an i still have battery life if you are looking for some good ear buds for a good price I recommend these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love these headphones,"These are my go to wireless headphones now, the sound quality is great for the price and the charging case is easy to throw in my bag. It charges up in the case about two and a half times before you need to plug it in, and the earbuds themselves last about 2-3 hours fully charged. It's not as long as I would like, but they're so small I really can't complain. They do fall out of your ears if you whip your head around (and I tried all the sizes of the rubber earpiece and found one that fits my ear) so it's ok if you're just lifting weights at the gym, but not great for dancing or any more full body workouts. I'm not a runner, but I would be afraid to run with these as I'd feel like they were constantly about to fall out. I have walked with them in and had no problem though, they just have to be occasionally adjusted.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Like the sound,I liked these headphones. I used them for days working around our property. I don't know how people like them for working out or swimming. Although they stay in your ear ok my experience you have adjust regularly while running. Eventually on a run one fell out quickly. I was not able to locate it. The downside of completely wireless.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pleasantly Surprised,"I didn't have high expectations for this product. The reviews were great but I've bought plenty of items with 4 1/2 stars that I felt were 3 at best. However, the TOZO T10 are remarkably good for the price. The sound is excellent but, best of all, the noise cancellation - due to a tight fit - was fantastic. My wife was 3 feet away from me when I first put them in and while I could see her lips move I didn't hear a word (a wonderful hidden feature).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Quality, function and fit","This is just a preliminary review. I've had the product almost a week now and am very pleased with it so far. I've used it on and off the whole week and haven't needed to charge it so far. The sound quality, specifically the bass, is amazing. I have to turn the volume all the way down so I don't feel like I'm going to damage my hearing.

That being said, it fits very well when I go running, doesn't fall out and I can still hear my music perfectly well. I did have to switch out the buds with the smallest size to fit my ears.

I'll update again in a few weeks when I try it lap swimming. I bought this product specifically for that.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
GREAT but not for long...Should last longer than 45 days!🤬,"Worked great for about a month & a half then just past the return ""window"" they started failing, I use them for about 2-4 hours a night to not disturb my GF's sleep while I'm watching TV in bed,I was very happy with this product until now...I feel that they should either repair or replace them regardless of the 30 return policy....$50+ for 45 days of usage, REALLY??",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Customer Service,"These earbuds have great sound quality and they fit really well because of the different sizes. I use them on a daily basis and have even tried them out in the shower several times with no problem.

I contacted customer service and they responded within 24 hours offering to send me another pair for free.  Great customer service!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good quality, helpful customer service","I recently got a pair of these and they are amazing. The sound quality is awesome, they fit in your ears snugly, are comfortable, are waterproof, have good battery life, charge quickly. But for some reason with my pair the left earbud sometimes has trouble connecting to the right one. Sometimes it works fine and sometimes it cuts in and out. I emailed the help people for TOZO and they offered to send me another pair for free. Very nice and willing to do a lot to help you be satisfied with their product. Hopefully when I get this pair they will work flawlessly. I definitely recommend getting these. Even if they have this slight connectivity problem.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great ear buds for a great price.,"I’ve had these for a few weeks now, and so far they deliver everything promised. I love the packaging, and that you can set the charging cradle on a wireless charger pad (if you have one). I listen to audiobooks mostly, and the lowest volume is perfect, so I get about 4 hrs out of one charge. I’m no audiophile, but music sounds great too. I work in a noisy environment and while these are not noise cancelling, they do a good job of muting that noise, allowing me to listen to my entertainment of choice at a low volume.

Setup was super easy on my iPhone 6 Plus. It finds them automatically now when I take the buds out of the charger (unless you’ve turned your Bluetooth on and off, then you have to pair them again). I have small ears and the smallest buds fit perfectly. I did try them in the shower, and they are indeed waterproof. Overall, I’m super happy with them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones Only Missing a Couple Features,"Bought these to avoid spending 3 times as much on Airpods and am very happy with my decision so far. The sound is great for the price and they fit very well. I've used these on runs and have no problem with the headphones falling out. The bluetooth connectivity is pretty good. Every once in a while it seems best to reset the headphones by putting them back in the charging case and then removing them again to repair. This solves the issues that occasionally occur if you don't put them back in the charger and just turn them off and try to repair. The battery life so far seems to really be 3+ hours and the case is good for a few more charges.

The only thing I missing is the ability to change volume and song via the button. The button allows for pausing only. This is only really a problems when on a run but is the thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars.

Overall I would definitely recommend these for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The reviews are a lie,I never give reviews until I saw a verified purchase  show an email of the company bribing people. My right ear bud cuts out when I turn my head and the loudest volume the headphone go is close to a cat meowing on your shoulder. This is a great product if you listen to your music softly I can hear everything around me at all times which I guess is nice if I'm going for a run alone  but for it to be called noise canceling. It's a lie there are no controls  but they do fit in the ear nicely even if they are sticking out they dont move from my ear.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Love these, awesome sound, great fit, waterproof.","I bought the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout as they were definitely the most reasonable.

Best Wireless Earbud Experience To Date!!,"I was on the market for a new true set of wireless earbuds when I came across TOZO T10 earbuds. What first caught my eye was high ratings and the great price, seeing how it was affordable I thought what the heck there’s nothing to lose. Once arrived the packaging was simple yet had a nice quality. But the real topic of conversation is the amazing sound and bass to come from these earbuds!! I was shocked to hear such strong bass and clear mids from these small earbuds. I would recommend these earbuds 100x over you won’t regret getting these amazing earbuds",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great in the shower,"The waterproof quality is especially nice. I can shower with them in just fine. It takes a little while to get used to inserting them so that they don’t fall out (the trick is to tug on your earlobe while you insert them and twist). My only real disappointment is how short the battery life is. I’m frequently having to put them back in the charger case more than I’d like, but at least the case holds a wireless charge so it’s not always tied to the wall.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrible connection never stayed connected music went in and out the whole time,I just got them yesterday. They went in and out of the connection my whole workout.

Pretty good,"I'm not an audiophile but the sound quality appears excellent.  Nice deep basses.  Pairing is easy.  Packaging was very good.  Problems: 1.  I use it to listen to my TV and there is a significant sound delay though it might be the stereo system or the dongle (Avantree Priva III) I'm using.  2.  Battery life is poor.  Doesn't get 3 hours of active listening.

Absolutely Amazing Product for price,"I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.

The housings on each earpiece have a matte black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included ear piecesThe earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out Bass. The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Falling in & out of Love,"I Love the ability to move around without a long cord getting in the way. However, I am having the hardest time keeping the earbuds in my ears.

"Great sound, what a great value","These earbuds are awesome.  I use them at the gym.  The quality is remarkable and the sound is perfect.  One of the best things is the earbuds light up (right and left) to make sure you put them in the right charging slot and of course the right ears.  Perfect size carrying case, so light and easy to carry around.  I highly recommend these earbuds.  You won't find a better pair for the money you pay.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bang for buck,"I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. Once you get your right fit of attachment, it sounds amazing and noise cancellation is decent too.

Definitely worth the money.

Much better than expected.,"I was very apprehensive when I bought it, expecting that it would be a lot of hype, but it works very well with my Samsung note 8, the sound quality was better than expected and the battery life is adequate.

Long review  - pros and cons,"So I will be honest, there's things i love about these and a few things I dont like but not enough to return them. Prepare for a long review!!!

I LOVE how small and compact the case is. It is convenient since I am not really a purse kind of girl so when I am using one, it's just a tiny little case. Neat idea but also a con for me since i listen to music practically all day.. but each bud has an approx 3 hr battery life and then the case is also a battery pack for the ear buds. There are 4 blue lights that indicate how much charge is left on the case. They are magnetic so when you put them in the case the ""click"" back in so to speak so no worry of them falling out of the case for any reason. The lid is also so magnetic so even better of accidentally dropping and opening.

Case can also be attached to a wireless docking station to charge instead of actually plugged in which is a plus when im in a rush and can just grab and go and not risk ripping out my charger when im not careful.

The sound is pretty clear and solid. My brother owns a different pair of wireless/bluetooth buds. We played the same song and put one of each in each ear to compare sound and feel. And to be honest, both were practically the same. (His were ENACFIRE E18 if you're curious. Also more expensive by like 10 bucks)

The great bass it claims to have isnt bad but not quite meeting expectations. Could always change your music settings to get extra.

Love these are waterproof as i bought these for my vacation trip tp California and it rained hard core for 3 of my 5 days there! So was nice i didnt have to worry bout them while out and about in the rain.

Some cons - using it for calls, doesnt really work well. I used it twice and both times the caller barely could hear me. He said i sounded far away. Granted the mic is in the ear buds lol so im not really surprised. And Im not going to shout to talk on the phone. But not a big deal since i bought these for the purpose of just listening to music with the convenience of no wires and at least knowing im getting a call.

Dislike these didnt come with different size ear piece covers. For my ear its snug, for my sister its too big, for my brother its too small. So i had to spend extra money to buy different size ear pieces.

Also a slight con is you have to use both at the same time. The left one connects to the right and the right connects to the phone. So if the left one isn't out of the case the right bud beeps every 10 seconds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent connectivity and value,"Over the years I have used bluetooth earbuds extensively. Have tried many top shelf brands (Bose, Sony, Jabra, Samsung) with mixed results. Received my TOZO T10 earbuds yesterday and have tested them out with my most critical clients and they have come thru with flying colors. They can hear me clearly with a minimum of background noise and I can hear them clearly as well. Easy to connect, operate independently if required, easy to custom fit and simple to use. Given the price and the one year extended warranty at no extra charge (upon registration with TOZO), best value I've seen and used for the last 10 years.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Highly reccomend this product!,The headphones came in the mail and after getting them to full charge I went through the process of the setup. Bluetooth worked perfectly for both earbuds. Its important to select the Tozo-R after your device picks up the signal. Sound quality is absolutley perfect with a deep sound (not tinny) and they are plenty loud enough to block out noise around you. They fit and are secure in my ear. Very comfortable. They seem built well enough to be durable however time will tell if they last.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear bud stopped working after 5 months,"I purchased these 5 months ago and maybe have a total of 5 hours of use on them. Compared to regular wired Apple EarPods that are acceptable to me, the sound quality is just a notch lower than the Apple. Otherwise, these pair quickly and charging case is cool also.

That said - my left ear bud is completely dead and no longer turns on or pairs. I have never dropped it or anything or even used working out. Not happy with this.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"For $50, not worth the money for what I wanted to use this.","I wanted to float on my raft in the pool to exercise my lower body. I put my phone that plays books on tape in a water proof bag and keep it no more then 2 feet from my head. The ear phones cut in and out, which is annoying. So I charged them for four days and tried them again today and they still cut in and out. SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY because it does not play well. I don't know if they will work if they get a little wet, because I kept my ears out of the water.

A Lot of Bang for Your Buck,I would definitely give this product 5 stars. I came in with decent expectations and was surprised to find out how great these earbuds really are. The sound quality is on par with much more expensive products. They also fit into you ear very nicely and even include custom tips to ensure they fit perfectly. The earbuds pair right when you open the case making them quick and easy to use. They are also completely waterproof meaning you can swim with them which is an awesome bonus.

Revised Review.  These are a great buy.,"This is more of an update to a negative review.

My first pair of Ear Buds would not stay connected to any of my Apple Devices.  It’s a pain to return items when life has me busy and traveling etc. - but I was forced to do so.

Now - the seller contacted me to discuss the problem.  They took control and quickly replaced the Ear Buds without any hassle or problems.  Their customer support is top quality for sure.

Now - the Ear Buds are up and running.  They carry good sound quality and pair easily with all of my devices.  They come with different sized tips for the best comfort.  I am not sure about battery life but so far it’s not too bad.

For the price - these things are great.

Their customer service takes all of the worry about a purchase.  Buy with confidence.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not Waterproof,"I bought these specifically because they were advertised as “waterproof “. The first time I used them, the left earbud fell out and dropped to the bottom of a 4’ pool. I picked them up within 30 seconds and placed back into my ear. The next day no sound would come out of it. I attempted to swim freestyle with the right earbud the following day. This time anytime the earbuds were submerged, it would mute. Eventually, it muted altogether. Both sides don’t work now, so I returned them.

Update 8/9/19:
I have tried three sets of these ear buds. I thought the first was just defective so I exchanged it for a new set. The second set of earbuds wouldn’t pair, but I did try swimming with the working one anyway. It eventually went dead. These are truly not waterproof, only water resistant. I returned the second set.

Then surprisingly Customer Service contacted me because of my 1-star review and offered to send a free pair for an updated review. I again had trouble getting them to pair, but my husband figured it out. You have to press the earbud until the blue light comes on. I was trying to tap it on or didn’t hold it down long enough when I did hold it down. These ear buds do work well out of the water, but I wouldn’t use them for swimming again. I don’t know that ear buds exist that are truly waterproof. If you find any, please let me know.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Amazing Sound & Fit, Left channel cuts out.","Let me start off by saying the sound these bad boys produce is amazing, slightly deep base mixed with perfect treble. Right out of the box I was blown away by the sound & fit! I’ve tried 5 different pairs over the last week and these fit like a dream!!! The noise canceling is decent as well. I cut the lawn after playing with them for an hour after opening them and I could barely hear anything but the sweet sounds of Queen, Eminem, & Mitch Hedburg (don’t judge) As for the battery, I takes me a solid 3 1/2 to 4 hours and they lasted longer then that. The only reason I’m giving 2 stars is due to the fact that the left channel will randomly go out at least every other song for a second before coming back and if I hold my hand close to either ear it cuts the left earbud out every time, I’ve tried re-pairing, resetting, and everything the manual says to no avail. But for the price you really can’t go wrong and I’m hoping I maybe just have a defective left earbud? Time will tell. I do wish they had a ‘skip ⏩ and previous ⏪’ feature but it’s not a selling point for me. Finally the wireless charger case works fantastic. If I didn’t have a issue with the left bud cutting out these would be a easy 5 stars much better then my Bose, AirPods, and Rowkin.

Of my ears and they are comfortable.  Also very easy to pair and the charging case is well designed.  You can see the status LEDs through the black translucent case which is a nice touch.  Haven’t worn them to swim laps but I am just superstitious that it would be the end of them, has nothing to do with the product.

These are not running headphones 🎧 and I’m so glad they exist!,These waterproof Bluetooth headphones are awesome!!!! I take them to the pool with me to drown out the sound of ill behaved children! Also good when you want to do a few tedious laps for a workout. These work very well and I did a submersion test in a glass of water to prove they’d hold up... no issues! The carrying case is amazing! You can charge the case and then it becomes the charger for your buds so you can charge them on the go! Case remains charged for a while before a recharge is needed. Perfect for someone who forgets to charge all their devices like me. And I love how you can charge them on the go! These are cheap considering function and quality! Gosh I love them! Yes they are a bit clunky and hard to squeeze into some ears but as long as you don’t do HIIT with them should be fine. And if you do HIIT I’d recommend just holding them in with a sweatband! They do water sports like they are intended to but might be clunky for running. I absolutely love these headphones and thank them for existing!!!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They are still going strong but due to heavy use and possible damage, they were becoming a little spotty, so I needed to replace them. These headphones, I'm pleased to say, are keeping up, so far, with my old fave pair!

The cons I'll go after first and all are minor or personal preference. They do feel a bit weighty in my ears, even with different cushions. It can cause part of my outer ear to ache slightly but that is after lots of hours of use. The other thing is the pairing, since the Left has to connect to the Right and can sometimes mess up due to other things they are connected to (my phone and comp will sometimes push the Left earbud out of connection) so I just have change a setting every once in awhile.

The pros are that the case holds great charge and saves me in case I forget to plug them in. The buds themselves have a long life too, so charging everyday or every other day isn't always necessary. They have a great feel to them as well, the buds and case don't feel flimsy or cheap.

Definitely a great buy, glad I didn't try for a different, higher priced brand.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sucks for phone calls, fine for music if it fits","I've only used these a couple times so far. I have the smallest ear pieces on and it still barely fits properly. I feel that if I actually run, instead if cleaning the house or taking a shower, that I will constantly have to adjust to make sure I don't lose one. My music sounds great but my friends say on phone calls, they can barely hear me or that I sound far away. It picks up all the background noises better than my voice. I'll give them a few more days before I complain or send them back. Probably wont make a difference.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than AirPods,My brother told me about these  HE said they were better than AirPods and he's right  They're comfortable and feel secure not like they're about fall out  Sound quality is really good and to be honest I sometimes forget they are in my ears Great Product and worth the price,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Price and Quality of item.,"Just got it and was easy to pair... It's friggin smarter than me, like literally it pairs itself. Dang!  Sounds good so far, I like my bass a bit deep with clarity.

A perfect choice for work out,"I have 3 pairs of earbuds from different companies. I was not satisfied with any of them because even though sound quality is reasonably good, they use to fall down easily. I just wanted to give a try one last time and I went ahead buying T10 this time. To my surprise, these earbuds are excellent on every front. They sound good, They fit perfectly into my ears, they are easy to connect. battery life is good. All this is 45$ price which is 1/4th of what apple charges you for airpods which are mediocre to say the least. All in all, Just go for T10.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent quality for a good price,"When opening the box, it seemed surprisingly better quality than I expected. Upon closer inspection however, you can see it is indeed cheap Chinese manufacturing. These are Bluetooth earphones under 50$ though, so that is to be expected. It comes with 3 sizes of ear buds, the smallest being the only one that fits me, and even so I’m constantly adjusting them to stay in my ears. It’s a minor nuisance but a nuisance nonetheless. Regarding sound quality, there’s way too much bass, it drowns out the mids and highs but not enough to completely ruin the experience. I use these solely for the gym, so it’s not a big deal to me, but I don’t use them any other time. Battery life is pretty good. I use these about 1.5-2hrs per day, 5-6 days a week on one charge. So roughly 9-12 hrs span for my usage. There’s no controls on the device themselves to adjust volume from what I can see, and the button is on the lateral portion of the earbud, so if you try to turn them off/on in your ear, you’re going to dig it deeper and cause some pain or discomfort. They are waterproof which is why I bought them, I sweat profusely and have ruined headphones before. So far they’ve held up just fine. Lastly, I clean my ears regularly, but since I have to shove them in so far just to maintain position, they accumulate ear wax and it grosses me out. All in all, you get what you pay for and they’re not that bad. However I would not recommend them for anything other than use for exercising.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Ear buds 100%,These are absolutely amazing!!! My son asked for AirPods.  I don’t have that kind of money to spend. I read all the reviews on these and went for it! My son is so happy with these I can’t thank you enough because once again I’m the best mom ever!!! I highly recommend this company and these ear buds!! The customer service is so kind. They check in on you to see if your happy with the product. Not to many company’s do that!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So Far I'm Impressed,"So I just got these yesterday, but what I noticed immediately was the sound quality.  I literally only had my volume turned up by *1* and the sound was clear, and louder than expected.  For that, I love them more than my regular ""plug in"" headphones.  I have to use the smallest earbud pieces, but they fit nice in my ears and don't feel like their falling out of my ears.  My true test with that will be running, as I really got these for running, but with the way they feel I'm thinking that won't be an issue.  For now I can't speak to any battery life, but they were super easy to pair to my phone, and the case they go into for charging is quite sturdy.  I can toss it into my gym bag or purse without worry.  When you put the earbuds into the charging case, it's magnetic, so they plop right in and stay put.  For now, I'm definitely impressed with these!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality product but beware,"I'll admit I rely on reviews pretty heavily when considering an Amazon purchase. So when I found myself on the market for a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, I was immediately drawn to these. Lots of reviews and (at the time) four and a half stars. That grabs your attention. This device had everything I was looking for. What I wasn't aware of at the time is that this company offers a free wireless charging station to those that purchase their product and leave a five star review. I have to say that is an extremely dubious way of inflating your positive five-star reviews. So don't be like me and rely too heavily on these reviews.

Having said that, I like the product a lot. They're great. They're comfortable. The sound is awesome. I haven't had them long enough to test the battery life, but so far, great. I disagree strongly with their manipulation of Amazon's review system.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
An Emerging Tech to have,"As a comparison with the Logitech Jaybird Vista with a IPX7, This is almost 1/4 the price of a consumer brand true wireless earbuds.

Sound quality is standard, but can use a EQ program on the connected device to make the experience little enjoyable.

The noise cancellation should be a ""staple"" (standard) to all true wireless which this have, but it does not have mic monitoring ( ambient sounds) that should be in all true wireless earbuds.

Battery life is enough for a normal use with the case as an additional battery life. It could do better with an upgrade of the charging plug from usb-b to USB type C and the chipset to have it charge the earbuds quicker. No need for rechargable lithium battery, NIMH is fine unless the weight of the battery matters.

The button click presets should be customizable and also should have a programable app on the connected devices. Only way is to put a better chipset in this product and have a detection alert if away from the connected device so if it gets lost or misplaced. Love all carrying cases with a holder for attachment which this has, also like the case to be less bulky if it could.

It is lightweight and should include those ear-guards for better grip and comfort, I separately bought eartips with a different material (cloud foam ""memory foam"") for in-ear grip/comfort and sound difference.

Most/all true wireless earbuds doesn't connect properly, having to putting it back in the case or pressing/holding a button to reset one of them. That should be something to look at and also I suggest a very low latency in sound connectivity if possible.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great earphones, better with foam earbuds.","These earbuds are great quality and work well. I am usually not a fan of earbuds since they fall out most of the time when I am working out. I tried the different sizes and these earbuds also started to fall out, so I bought ear tips which were irritating. Finally I tried foam earbuds which work really well since they expand once they're in your ear. I don't use these earbuds often, but I do have to charge them about 1-2 times a week. Other than that these earbuds are great",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Superior product at Great Price,"The product is excellent. The sound quality is impressive and are really waterproof. I love that I can charge them wireless, so easy and no need to plug in the cable every time you need to charge them, I just put the case over the same charger I use for my iPhone and done. Love the magnetic lock that the buds have so you can open the case without caring that one of them will fall. When I bought the TOZO earbuds I also bought another very expensive brand that has no magnetic lock nor wireless charging, (big mistake) I ended up using the TOZO ones by default.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice product - Ear Buds too Big,"The noise canceling feature is great, sound quality is good. I plan on returning this product, as it has been sitting in the case after trying it for 24hrs.

Perfect to walk my dog,"I use these headphones to take my dog out for a walk.  Not sure if it is the headphones, the audio book or the dog, but I get to walk way more than before!  It cancels the street noise, however I can be aware of my surroundings.  They are also very comfortable in my ears once I found the right fit.  Also, they charge easy and quick.

Wowzers,"Wow. Iam truly impressed. Normally I spend $50-100 on a pair of nice quality wired earbuds but I figured that since I hate carrying around a separate cord(and I keep losing it) for my iPhone I would try some Bluetooth earbuds...

Sound quality is very nice and rich. I would say that these are the perfect rap/hip-hop earbuds. The bass is deep and hits very well. While you can definitely enjoy some other genres. I feel the bass slightly overpowers some delicate guitar riffs and snare sessions; sometimes even a singer with a deep voice can seem too deep. But all in all I really could not ask for a better set of earbuds; especially at this price. Keep up the good work guys!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Truely phenomenal engineering work,"Earbuds fits the ear pretty well compared to the other earbuds I have used before. Sound quality is phenomenal. Signal distortion is next to zero. I tried swimming with these but practically you can’t listen to music while swimming because the signal bounces off when your head is in the water. I recommend wearing a single earplug in the side where your head comes off the water for breathing. The other side will get disconnected since it rarely comes out of the water. Not to mention that I was using the front crawl swimming technique. In general as long as you keep your head above water, the earplugs will work fine. Battery life is pretty reliable and probably holds the record for being one of the best earbuds battery life I have ever dealt with. Also, the two sides get paired immediately and sometimes it struggles to detect the phone. A simple restart can easily solve the problem. By so far, the only concern is that it pauses automatically without any user inferences. It has not been a huge hazzle but hope it won’t get any worse.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Basic functinalities are missing.,"Let me start by saying that when you pay $50 for a product made in china, you expect some features and quality at least.
I have tried resetting the device twice and was still seeing the issues below.

Pros
- Good Sound Quality
- Wireless charging

Cons
- If you need to use one bud you can't charge the other one, as soon as other bud goes into charging case, connection is lost and there is no sound in the other one. I tried with both
left and  right. It does work if you are not charging the other one but I don't see think that is useful.
- You have to pair them every time you take them out of the case. It just forgets the paired devices.
- Since one of them is primary which makes the connection and other kind of connects to primary, there are small sound gaps on secondary one where the sound is completely lost.
- If the device you have paired the buds with is on the left side of your body, buds start cracking and the device is within 10m.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Left ear drops constantly!,"Great sound and volume but the headphones keep cutting out on the left side. It’s very annoying!
I don’t know if this is common or I’ve got a busted pair. If I cover the right side with my hand it kills the signal. I’ve noticed if I move my head in certain ways, like drinking a beverage, they cut out. They even cut out if I tilt my head sometimes.

Left and Right Cutting Out,Got them to use while working out. They arrived Saturday and I started using them on Monday. Thought they were a bit bulky for my small ears but using the smallest ear tips gave me a good comfortable fit. By Wednesday morning while using only the right earbud I noticed my music kept cutting out while sitting at my desk with my phone beside me. I then connected the left and both kept cutting out.

Excellent earbuds for the price,"First thing I noticed was the look and feel of these earbuds give off a quality built product.

The earbuds automatically turn on when removed from the case. After inserting them into my ear and rotating them into place, they felt very secure. Both earbuds proceed to tell you that they connect to each other as a pair and once syncd via Bluetooth to your phone, will say Device Connected. When you put the earbuds back in the case they automatically disconnect from your device and turn off to be charged.

As far as sound, there is a great balance between bass and all around sound quality. If I had to rate the sound quality, I would say it’s between a skull candy bass earbuds and Dre Beats ear bud.

The case itself being a charger is awesome and it has plenty of indicator lights showing you that it’s charging and how much battery life is in the case before it needs to be recharged.

The Vendor was also very proactive in making sure everything was working properly and that there were no issues.

I had to change out the size to fit my ear better but they are amazing and easily worth a 5 star rating I'm super impressed by these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great product,"My co worker had this, and I liked it because it was personal light and portable. I wasn't so sure about the sound, until I bought it, and the surround sound like system that it possesses blew me away. Only thing it lacked was a longer duration (mine lasts for about 2-3 hours watching a movie, but longer listening to music). This is perfect for traveling or watching a personal show or movie with out disturbance, the sound cancellation is superb. I would suggest this to anyone, you won't be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are my favorite out of 3 different brands I tried,"I've bought and tried 3 different allbeit similar styles all about the same price on here give or take 5-10$. These are my favorite.

 The case is slightly larger and made of a higher quality plastic that others and feels good in your hand, as in you aren't going to drop it handling it.

The voice that talks to you speaks comprehensive English which is nice. Pulling the earbuds out and putting in your ear tells you it is connected left to right and then tells you it's synced to your device. Other models I tried had broken or incomprehensive English akin to Chinese restaurant menus attempting to tell you what your earbuds are doing.

The case has a nice cover over the charging port, as well as the case being capable of charging your device about 4 times. The lid for the case also has 3 small magnets that keep the lid closed.

The earbuds, are comfortable, stay in my ears and comes with different size gromets for other size of ears. I have worn these at work, rock climbing (inverted), at the gym. Never once having them fall out.

Another feature I liked that is unlike other styles is the waterproof buttons (one on each ear) is a physical button, not a soft touch button (think Xbox one power button) the difference being with this style I don't unintentionally pause my music when my shoulder grazes my ear at the gym or stretching. It's a nice feature, taking a deliberate action to pause or make a phone call ensures you won't get the Bluetooth equivalent of a butt dial.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent bluetooth earbuds!,"Have had these earbuds for around a month now and they're fantastic. Great sound and bass, IPX8 water resistant and a great overall value!

These things rival more expensive product on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound for the price,"The earbuds connected to each other and to my phone as advertised. It took a few tries to find the best fitting pads, but after that the listening experience was excellent.

"Poor sound quality, good construction","When first opening the box, I was impressed by the quality of both the earbuds and the charging case. I have also been impressed by the battery life, which has been much better than my previous pair of Bluetooth headphones. However, the sound quality is quite poor. It's extremely tinny sounding and has poor range as well. Better options can be found out there",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sound is terrific, but control is another story.","I mainly use these earbuds for listening to music.  They are terrific.

I tried them to make phone call, but the person on the end was complaining poor quality.

Here are the breakdowns of pros/cons:

** PRO **
- Sound is terrific

** CON **
- Phone conversation is not so great.
- No rewind, skip, or volume control.
- If you have small ears, these earbuds do stick out.
- Slow bluetooth connectivity.  It took awhile for earbuds automatically connect to my Galaxy Note 9.
- Bluetooth connectivity is often choppy when the RIGHT earbud is not close AND/OR in the line of sight with your smart devices, such smartphone, smartwatch, etc.  Whenever my Galaxy Note 9 is on the left AND/OR behind me as well as my Fitbit Versa, the bluetooth connectivity is weak.  To resolve this, swap your earbuds where the RIGHT earbud is in your left ear.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
good quality sound  and comfortable,"I like the quality of the sound and comfortable fit of these earbuds. Easy charging case, though putting in charging wire could be easier. Thus far i truly enjoy this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Volume Control,"Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.

UPDATE REVIEW...
This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"""Combination of features I'm really happy with...""","I really like the multiple size choices. I have very small ear canals and it was nice to find ear buds that won't fall out easily. I love that I can exercise (yoga, Palate) and not have anything flopping on my neck. I also like the way the ear buds look...small and not noticeable. So far, so good. Connection is not hard. I love the charging case. Sound is good, but I'm not really picky as long as the sound is clear and consistent. I've been very happy so far.
UPDATE : I bought a second pair for my husband and he uses the largest ear buds. It's nice that we can both have a pair that fit us well and work well. Again, so far, so good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the hearing impaired! (If you can get them to hold a charge),"Addendum to my review below:  I am so sad that after a few days of use, I can’t seem to get these to hold a charge for any length of time!  The directions you get with this product are pretty worthless—definitely translated from Chinese—and  they don’t go out at the same time.  One goes out, then works for a while, then here goes the other one.  When they both work, the sound is truly amazing.  I’m SO disappointed! I thought I had finally found the answer to my need for increased volume, but they seem to always need to be on the charger.  I’m changing my rating from a 5 to a 1
I have a hearing loss and wear hearing aids. Other Bluetooth collars I’ve had were difficult for me to hear music/Audible books because maximum volume wasn’t enough if there was any outside noise at all. I am so happy that I can hear with my new Tozos!!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surpassed expectations while being the best bang for your buck.,"I was sceptical about most things, particularly the waterproof part of the earphones as I was unable to find any testing of any sort online and only saw negative reviews about it. However, I can testify that after using these in the shower as the manual said I could, I was surprised to see that it was still working after constant exposure to water. The audio quality is excellent with minimal complaint. There are few minor quality of life changes such as changing songs and the volume with the buttons that I would like to see but other than that it is a great product that I would recommend or buy for others.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones!,"One of the reasons there are so many great reviews is that you can get a free wireless charger if you write a review, so here's mine.

Awesome wireless earbuds,"All as stated, easy setup , good price, fast shipping , works great !!!! Will be using it while driving motorhome, airline flights and car rides.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Completely STOPPED functioning after 2 months.,"The earbuds were decent while they lasted. The left earbud would intermittently cut in and out, and got significantly worse as time went on (against my thought that it was originally just a software glitch, this problem sounds more hardware-related).

Also the earbuds randomly activated while in the charging case, so sometimes the earbuds would turn on and remain on and completely drain themselves and the case charge. At a certain point (inconveniently outside of the return window), the left earbud now completely fails to charge when placed in the charging case dock.

I do NOT recommend these earbuds.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for less money,"These are awesome.  I figured I’d try these before spending a lot of money on Apple ear buds . I’m glad I did. They sound great, fit comfortably in my ears, easy to connect, and charge fast and easy in the case. I would highly recommend these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Suprisingly good noise cancelling,"Context: Wanted headphones to use at work and when going for walks/bike rides.

I changed the rubber ear socket to a slightly larger size and found it fitted perfect, recommend to test different sizes before you commit to one.

The noise cancelling is surprisingly good, I could barely hear the person talking next to me even with no music.

The base is strong, I think because of the great acoustic seal the ear buds make. So its not having to work too hard, allowing the base to have a lot of clarity. There is good acoustic clarity in the higher spectrum as well.

I still need to test more in different environments but so far I'm impressed overall especially at this price range.

Also the boot up time and auto sync between L and R is great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound and deal for the money,"I like these, but they were hard to sync at first. Just takes a bit of patience, I would not wear them swimming, they say waterproof,  But that is not the problem. The problem is they fit loose in the ear they would fall out easily. I do light workouts on treadmills and do weights and they do fine but if you are doing somersaults flipping around for anything super extraneous out get something with more secure holdings",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not for exercise,"If you plan to do anything besides sit in a chair typing these are NOT for you.  Have run these through their paces and they CONSTANTLY fall out of my ears.  I have tried all 4 sizes of included soft attachments and none of them stay in place during even light movement.  Its fine if you're doing weights but during running, jumping, even pushups they constantly slide out and i have had several ear aches from constantly jamming them back into place.  Sound is average, battery life is good, and durability is good (because they fall from my ears regularly and haven't broken yet form hitting the floor).  As soon as i submit this I will be ordering a different set that won't constantly be falling out and these will just be for sitting at the computer.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Sound, great fit!","Love the dynamic range of these headphones. The sound is superior.

With Samsung Note 10, it Is great with no adjustments. Bought master&dynamics, more going to return the $300 earbuds for a $50 pair. If sound quality matters over features, try these.

Sounds amazing but has function issues,Simply walking around they loose connectivity in the left ear. When I contacted tozo they said it's because the human body has a magnetic field and disrupts the connection. Sorry. Also I've noticed they will be sitting in my truck and they will randomly connect to my phone inside the house and I've tried to turn them off manually this makes the battery case die fast so they never really hold a good charge.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I really loved them but now the charging case isn't working,"I really loved these ear phones. They fit in my ears perfectly (small ears).
They're kind of bulky but still not too bad (I think because I have small ears)
The ear phones themselves hold a long charge. I use them at the gym and at work.

After a few months the charging case went out. I only holds one charge before I have to recharge the case again (the case use to last me two or three days and now not even one day). Which doesn't give the ear phones enough time to get a full charge.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I've never experienced BASS like I have with these before!,"So I actually bought some airpods about a year ago and was disappointed by the sound quality, the lack of bass and lack of noise cancellation.

The bass is OUT OF THIS WORLD, I'm a bass player and can listen to every single note with clarity.

Great product and costumer service,"Received my Toxo-T10 earlier this week and im not only impressed with the design but also the sound quality these little things provide

They are easily compatible to my old Beats by Dre which after 1 year of use they gave out. Safe to say I will never purchase Beats ever again.

These TOZO wireless earbuds work flawlessly in pairing with my mobile device. I love the black design and especially the portable charging case. My gym workouts have been pleasant once again especially with these new earbuds from TOZO

Exactly what I wanted,"I recently purchased the TOZO T10 earbuds.  I've used wireless headsets before, but they always felt ""clunky"" when I was working in the yard or hiking.  These arrived right on time.  They were almost fully charged when they arrived.  As expected, they came with extra ear buds so you can find your perfect fit, but mine fit just right straight out of the box.  I work from home, and I keep a wireless charging pad on my desk - I really like that I can charge the TOZO earbuds wirelessly - and they charge FAST!  Great sound quality using them with my phone or with my FitBit.  Very comfortable and stable.  I haven't really tried their water resistance yet (I will this summer) but I haven't had any problems with them wanting to slip out of my ears no matter what I'm doing.  Really couldn't be happier with the product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing earphones!!! Definitely worth the price!,"I got tired of using wired earphones because they break on me really easily, so I was looking for wireless earphones that will last me a long time. I'm not going to lie; I was really apprehensive before buying these earphones because I've never spent more than $20 on earphones and I was afraid of making a wrong investment. After looking through several wireless earphones, I decided to settle on these Tozo ones due to the overall positive reviews. I LOVE THESE EARPHONES! I love how I can't hear any outside noise when I have these on, so the noise cancellation aspect of these earphones is excellent. I was afraid that these earphones won't be able to withstand high volumes, but to my satisfaction, whatever you're listening to can get very loud if you want to increase the volume. When it comes to earphones, I don't care for the bass quality much, thus I prefer a clean sound. However, I immediately noticed these earphones have a good amount of bass for those who appreciate it while the sound still sounds clear. One thing I don't like about wireless earphones is that they often need to be charged, but these earphones charge quite quickly and easily. They automatically fit into their respective spots inside the charging box, and the box is small and compact enough that you can take it anywhere. I'd say one whole charge would last about three hours, maybe, and it doesn't take long for the earphones to charge up. For those worried about the earphones hurting or not fitting their ears, there are different sized tips, so you can try on each one and find the right size. These earphones also stay in your ears even if you dance and jump around a lot like how I do. I really like these earphones!!! I'm planning to buy another pair for my mother as a surprise gift as she appreciates a good set of earphones. I recommend you try these earphones!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Wireless Earbuds!!,These earbuds are fabulous.  The sound quality is excellent no matter what volume you choose to use these earbuds for.  I've had some wireless earbuds before but they did not cancel out any of the outside noise but these do!  I use these earbuds at work when I walk (usually outside) and I can get a good week of not charging out of the earbuds.  They do not need to be charged every night - which is fabulous as I do not need one more thing to remember at night to do.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound great and comfortable (if they work),"*Update: I received a replacement pair which seem to work as intended. The representative at Tozo told me to keep the earbuds I already had, which saved me the hassle of returning them and also left me with a spare set of earbuds and a charging case. The second charging case I received seems to be a little wonky, the left earbud wiggles around a bit too much and if it moves it may switch back and forth between charging and pairing modes. This is a little annoying but since I had a functional case already I just put the new earbuds in the first case and called it a day. I'm upgrading my overall review to 4 stars because the second pair is functional, continues have great sound, comfort and ease of pairing, and the customer service was very good.*

These earbuds and their charging case are well designed, comfortable, sound great with great volume for their size (tweak your eq to bring up the bass and make sure you get them deep into your ears to get the most out of low tones), and charge quickly. However, my first pair has problems with the sound in the left earbud sputtering and cutting out rather frequently. It's hard to tell if this is related to an unstable bluetooth connection or a physical defect, though it seems to happen most when I move around or adjust either earbud, leading me to believe they are somehow damaged. Customer service responded to me almost immediately, offering to replace them. I would like to give them a higher rating if my second set works properly because the sound, comfort and security in my ears are truly great for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent!,This is my second attempt at buying wireless earbuds.  The first Esanik True Wireless Earbuds even though at first glance look very similar were miles inferior. Regrettably they've been thrown away because they quit holding a charge after 3 months.  The sound on the TOZO earbuds is comparable to my Bose headphones which is no exaggeration.  I can't believe the clarity and quality of these from start to finish and especially the base which is super important.  You need to have a proper fit which makes a huge difference in sound quality however the different sizes needed are included.  I rarely take the time to review an item but music is part of my life so much I hope this can help someone understand these are an amazing deal and worth every penny.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Absolutely Amazing!,"For the price of these earbuds, they’re actually pretty much worth it! They sound amazing, you can feel the bass, they pair to your Bluetooth very quickly, and the charger for them is amazing.

Great earbuds for the price,Really solid headphones.  They paired super quick.  The sound quality is better than I expected.  The bass is pretty good.  They feel really solid and well built.

Comfortable Airpod-like Earbuds for Android,"Despite the fact that I have several wired ""wireless"" bluetooth headphones for my devices, I have friends who use Airpods with their iPhones, and it looked rather convenient to have such a small device ready at the moment's notice while out and about. So I decided to shop around and see what I could find. This is my first foray into a device of this style, you know - completely wireless, but so far I am very pleased with them.

My first concern was size. Airpods have that little stick portion that hangs out of the ear, and there are several Android styles similar to that, but I have a few pairs of Skullcandy earbuds that use this model's offset ear canal design, and I find them far more comfortable than older, straight line earbud designs. The TOZO earbud is a good size, and the weight is very comfortable in the ear. It is not difficult, even with how small they are, to pick them out of the case, or to fit them into the ear when needed. The directions included make it easy to understand how to use them, but if you fit the right size cups, and then insert and twist like you are told, you will have a tough time shaking the buds loose. That said, I still bought the Amazon 3 Yr Warranty, it's $5, just in case something happens, better than shelling out another $40.

OF NOTE: I read several reviews of people who didn't seem to understand the interchangeable ear cups. The fact is that everybody has different size ear canals, so you have to take the time upfront to try out each size cup in your own ear to find the best fit, then use that pair of cups on your buds. If you, like my wife, don't like ANYTHING in your ears, then this is NOT the product for you, so don't buy it and then review it like it should be an over-ear headphone.

My second concern was sound quality. I am definitely a techie, and an audiophile, though not to the level of snobby hipster, if I say so myself. The TOZO buds play my Amazon music from my phone (LG G8) with good clarity and nice sound, but I had to play with my phone's equalizer to shift the tonal quality around, remove some of the highs because it was a bit tinny on the normal phone settings. Once I shifted it around, I found that the Hip Hop EQ gave the best sound, no matter what music style I was listening to (in case you are curious, I tried some rock with Hoobastank and Avenged Sevenfold, some country with Sam Hunt, and then R&B with Tank and Ne-yo, and it sounded excellent across that entire spectrum in Hip Hop EQ). If your device has EQ settings, I absolutely recommend you adjust those to find your musical sweet spot! The only thing that I took one star for in this area is that, even with volume for my buds turned up to 100% on my phone, the buds themselves did not thrash my eardrums, which is probably a good thing, saving my volume for my old age, but sometimes, you need to headbang to death metal and want it LOUD. Considering the size of the buds speaker driver, they are adequately loud, and with it fitted snugly in the ear canal, it does a great job of reducing external noise. Totally plan on using these for when I am riding my mower or working in my wood shop!

Next: Bluetooth connectivity. The pairing process is super easy, because the button design is simple. Unlike some of the other buds on Amazon, these are not ""touch-style"" but have a mechanical ""click"" button. Fantastic! Nothing worse than something tapping your bud in the middle of your favorite jam and then having to stop whatever you are doing to fix it. Some people noted that TOZO has R or L models, but the reality is that you can use either bud independently. The model choice just assigns the default earbud, because some people have an ear preference. If you want to use either one, then take the time to actually pair both in your bluetooth menu, and then you just have to pick the active one if it doesn't sync automatically. Handy when the primary bud is dying in the middle of a phone call! Besides all of that, they normally pair quickly without any actions needed on the device, and they will give you little beeps and messages in your ear to let you know that everything is working, so you don't have to pull your phone out and look to make sure. Nicely done, TOZO!

Bonus features: The case is sized nicely, fits in the pocket comfortably, but it is definitely larger than an Airpods case. Not a big deal for me, as a jeans or cargo shorts kind of guy, but I can imagine for a woman wearing yoga pants or skinny jeans, that might be an issue. Case is QI wireless charging capable, which is FREAKING AWESOME. Totally recommend wireless charging like other reviewers have said, incredibly convenient and saves your phone from the infamous ""broken usb port"" problem. Same thing here, and the ""grab and go"" functionality this provides for your buds cannot be understated! Holds enough charge to keep your buds going for about 30 hours, longer if you only use one bud at a time like I do at work. I have not tested the waterproof capability, but the buds seem well constructed and tightly sealed, so I believe their claims would probably be well founded. They do state in the instructions that they cannot be used submerged (but aren't they IPX8? wait for it...), not because of the waterproofing, but because you won't get signal underwater from the bluetooth device, which makes some sense.

So to sum up, TOZO has taken their earlier designs up to a new level with a solid construction, great style and fit, and good sounding speaker to deliver a comfortable earbud that gives an Airpod-like experience for those of us with Android or regular bluetooth devices. 5 Stars overall!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Best & Smartest Bluetooth Earbuds I've ever tried, and I have tried several!","Pros: Great sound quality, quick charging, always ready to go! I'm very happy with these. The sound is suburb, good bass, and these actually stay in my ears, as opposed to so many i've tried! My left ear is weird and i cant get regular earbuds to stay in, but the Tozos have no issues. Very surprised. Great value!

Cons: a few bugs. sometimes the buds wont connect to eachother right away, and you have to ""reset"" them by placing both back into the case for a second then take them back out and they connect just fine.
I've used them to talk on phone calls and people usually complain that they can't hear me if i'm outside or in a crowd, but i have used other bluetooth headphones for calls with no issues, so i'd say thats their weakest point. Don't get them if you're strictly going to make calls outdoors around lots of people and noise.

Other than that you won't be disappointed!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"DISAPPOINTING, Sub-par Bluetooth connection","Like most of you, I was sitting reading the overall great reviews of this product hoping not to fall into the airpod trap. Alas, I am unsure whether or not I received a lemon or if they were just truly that bad, but mine struggle to stay connected when my phone is in my pocket. It is not a phone issue as I connect to bluetooth stuff all day (car, radio, speakers, computer etc.) I used them for 3 days, now they sit on my desk unused... really wish they did better.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor sound and connectivity,"Pros:
Fit in my ear perfectly. Always had an issue with headphones fitting in my ears.

That's where the pros end though....

The sound quality on these is awful. I'm not sure if I just got a faulty pair, but the reviews always talk about how fantastic the sound quality is. For me, in most music I listen to, it sounds like all of the audio is clipping or something. Cymbals have a popping, or crackling kind of sound and it's regardless of volume. It's like that with most things, but cymbals have been the hardest to ignore since they are always there.... Its been like that since the first time I tried them so it's not like I could have broken them somehow?

Bluetooth connectivity is garbage too. Just like alot of the other reviews say, anything you are doing anything BUT sitting in one place, they will constantly disconnect. As a runner that's an absolute deal breaker for me.

Battery life is ok I guess, nothing to brag about though compared to other brands.

I would be very cautious about buying these, I have no idea how every review is so positive",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Expected better.,"I’ve had these for a month. Here are honest pros and cons.

PROS:
They are durable, Ive dropped them a few times pretty hard and they suffered 0 damage.
The noise cancellation feature works as advertised.
They are pretty loud.
The CASE battery life lasts pretty long, enough for my 9 hour shifts at least.
They’re wireless, obviously, that’s always a plus.

CONS:
The right earbud charges slower and dies faster than the left one.
If you only have one earbud in, it’ll glitch out depending on if something is covering the opposite one. Kind of annoying.
The bass is almost non existent.
The overall battery life for the earbuds themselves only last about 2.5 hours, because if one earbud dies, the other won’t work, and the right earbud dies way faster than the left one. So I have to deal the the uneven charging and uneven battery life.

Overall, these earbuds are good and do the job, but they’re definitely not perfect and I don’t know if I’d ever buy them again.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Functional, Effective, Great price and gives you freedom from wires!!!","I purchased this recently and the quality and packaging of the product surprised me, it's so good that I have stopped using my Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are great for workouts and answering calls anytime. They fit well in my ears and are not too big, they are just the right size, and you could change the silicone caps for your own convenience. The charger is very compact and well built, they do the work really well and at such an awesome price. They have a decent battery life and gets more with the charger pod. Will be buying more as gifts.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Connection drops frequently,"This is the second pair of random Chinese earbuds I have purchased on Amazon and they were both defective. The sound quality is OK, not good but not terrible either. The charging case is nice as it successfully extends the battery life pretty well.

BIG PROBLEM: whenever I move around with these, like walking or working out, the slave earbud drops connection to the master for a second quite frequently. This is incredibly disruptive and frustrating. As long as I sit still like at a desk they are fine, but as soon as they get moving there are constant drops in connection. Indications of a faulty product or terrible quality control at the manufacturer. You get what you pay for, and these are just another set of relatively cheap Chinese electronics that may or may not serve you well.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Love the wireless, waterproof headphones!","These headphones are great. I felt so free and amazing at the gym where I usually feel a bit restricted even with wired bluetooth headphones.

The fit is great for me and they come with multiple ear sizes if the first fit isn't good for you.

I'm very critical of sound and these didn't let me down. Treble and bass is great IMO.

Add in the fact that they're water proof you really can't go wrong for the price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound & Comfortable,This is the first time I have purchased wireless earbuds. I was always worried about the size and if they really would stay in my ear. I am very pleased with the TOZO Earbuds. The sound is great and they are not heavy in my ear. I was very pleased to find that they come with multiple size ear foam pieces to fit as snug or loose as you would like. I would definitely recommend.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrible for phone calls and even worse for music or audio books.,"They sound great, when they are connected. The volume fades in and out and they disconnect a lot. I have used these with my previous phone and my new S9 Note, same issues. If I dare to get very far away from my phone, it's worse. People also have difficult hearing me when I use them for phone calls. I'm past the date to be able to return, so they will sit in a drawer.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best buds on the market and a great price!,Love these buds. That fit perfectly and are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Pairing and charging is so easy. I have used many other listening products and none compare to these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality Headphones,"After 6 months of daily use I still love these headphones.

Near perfect headphones!,"Among the various headphones I've used, these provide the best fit for me personally along with its exceptional sound quality. These headphones work very well of you're involved in an activity that deals with hard work such as fitness. Sweating is a big issue between headphones and me so the implementation of water resistance is much appreciated. Astonishingly, even the battery life gave me a good 3-4 hours (about how long I work out) of listening experience. These headphones are the near perfect choice for training and would recommend to anyone wanting to invest in a pair of headphones for a good price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great except for one thing,"These sound great. They are loud enough, which is not always the case for Bluetooth headphones. They pair with my phone quickly and easily. The charging case seems to be good quality. Great sound cancellation and price point. All good things. But there is one major flaw; at least with the set I received. The batteries don’t last! Seems like I only get an hour of use before I get low battery warnings, which are also far too frequent; chiming in about every 20 seconds. Then they die. This has happened to me after each full charge. If the batteries lasted as long as advertised these would be a five star product all day. However, I am probably going to return them. I might order a second set after in hopes this particular set is defective because I really do like them otherwise.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Cuts in and out while walking,Bought this item for my husband and he took it out for his walk and it kept cutting in and out every 30 seconds so time is being returned,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent earbuds.,"Overall: sound is amazing. They are durable and seem to be very good quality. Charges well.
However, i cant just get the right bud to pair without it beeping every few seconds. I end up pulling out the left bud and leaving it on the table.
Also, it feels like its going to fall out, no matter how i place it. I shake my head amd it doesnt fall out, but it feels like its going to.
Again, overall i recommend getting these. Much better than the bluetooth headset with wires and all. I will never go back to using wires after using these ear buds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

One of the better earbuds that I have purchased here on Amazon.,"I've purchased many wireless earbuds/headphones from Amazon. I dislike wireless earbuds that have a wire connecting the them, so I tend to lean towards earbuds. These earbuds caught my eye because of it's IPX8 feature. As I have lose many due to rain or just stupidity, I decided to give these a try. I bought these and immediately tested them out in a shower (since they even advertise that). Expecting them to be like most earbuds that claim to be water-resistant, I braced for the worst. To my  surprise, they survived. This already has been a big plus. I haven't tested them underwater, but that will be the next step. The sound quality is is as good as you'll get without spending hundreds of dollars on other earbuds. The battery life is about standard to most earbuds on the market now. Speaking on that, another surprising feature is that the case can be charged wirelessly. In this day and age, wireless charging is becoming more prominent, and this feature just made this more convenient. More to come and will update in a few months.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well worth it. Just buy them!,"Initial first impression... These earbuds are well worth the money. Sound quality is great. Pairing was a snap. Excellent bass. Battery life has been as advertised. Range is as good as the high-end units.

I really like being able to use left or right independently. Phone quality is good.

And the charging case Qi capable (wireless charging).

I will update if any issues arise.

Update Feb 9 '19
These ear buds are still great. My only complaint is the charging case. I wish it had more capacity. I have to recharge the case every night.

Still 5 stars",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones at a great price!,"This is my first pair of wireless headphones so I have nothing to compare these to for wireless, but as far as sound goes these things rock!

Overall I have been very happy with these headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Ease of use,These are great earbuds!  I bought my husband a pair and he loves them. He is deaf in one ear and can use just the one without any problems.

Wonderful experience!!,"I ordered Tozo Wireless Earbuds and have to mention that it has been such an amazing experience. The sound quality is nice, was able to hear the bass and beats clearly.

So Far so Good!,I’ve only used once. My primary use is for the gym. I’m a runner and was looking for ear buds that were loud and waterproof.

Free wireless charging pad with BS 5 star review,"First and foremost be warned that the amazing reviews are thanks to a free offer for a wireless charging pad in exchange for a 5 star review. The main reason I purchased this brand was because of how many people raved about them. I was super annoyed when I found out the truth.
The truth: they're not bad. They sound great and feel comfortable and the case feels very sturdy and safe. They last about three hours and charge in about 1 hour. And at this decent of a price, who can complain?",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They do EVERYTHING very well and they are just as described!  High quality stuff!  I wear them while cycling in (right now) 100+ degree humid heat in South Carolina and not only do they stay in place, but they are unaffected by sweat, etc.  Amazing sound, amazing clarity.  These things should easily cost $200.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What a waste !,"I purchased this product after reading through all the great reviews and great expectations. What I experienced with this product has been a mix bag.
It pairs easily when removed from the charging case with the first device and with the left channel. The sound quality for music and movies from my iPad are pretty decent.
I paired it with a total of 4 devices and have been using it for a about 6 months with a mixed experience.
If there is only 1 device in the vicinity, then it takes an abnormally long time to pair with it, and it is constantly scanning for the other devices making a ping sound when unable to pair  (WHY??), causing a huge nuisance. So now, I have reset them both multiple times and have it paired with just one device. And still it keeps seeking the other missing device(s?). What a very strange ghostly behavior. And yes, resetting it multiple times seems to have minimal effect on this behavior.  So, I have wasted $50. It's not worth considering these as a alternative to any of name brands!!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding customer service,Update :  I had an issue with the earbuds and contacted for customer support .  The customer service responded within 24 hours and offered a resolution to my problem .

Amazing headphones!,"I purchased these headphones in preparation for a 6.5 mile run/race. I was tired of my wire headphones getting in the way. But I was also concerned for water because I sweat alot and wanted to use them at the gym and for running. Well let's just say these headphones delivered. They stayed in place, had great sound quality and didn't get ruined by water/ sweat. I love these and am extremely satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good Sound Quality, Reasonably Priced, Good Value,  Right Choice","Very good quality for the price.  The earbuds are small enough to be comfortable in the ear and come in a sturdy and protective charging case that will also recharge your earbuds.  They paired easily to me Pixel 3.  Good sound quality for music and movies and phone conversations.  Comfortable fit and they didn't fall out during normal wear once I placed the right earbud cushions on the earbuds.  The earbud must be placed in the ear channel for proper fit and to keep the device in place during normal wear.  I tested the noise level from external sources while listening to music and movies on the TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds.  They are not noise cancelling.  You can hear noise in the background but most prominent is the audio in your ear.  I had no trouble hearing the words of the music or people talking in movies.  I was able to hear the audio clearly without turning  the volume up to an uncomfortable level in my ear.  I had no trouble focusing on the music or movie because it was the most prominent thing I was hearing.  I bought these for listening to audio media on a plane.  I think that they will work just fine.  During phone call (and video call) conversations, I was able to hear the conversation in both ears clearly.  These earbuds have exceeded my performance expectation;  especially nice since the price of the earbuds was reasonable.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

That didn't go as planned.,"For some reason the volume would go down on it's own and slowly go back to where it originally was. This would happen about three to four times in a row, then it would stop. A few minutes pass by and itll begin doing it again. Instead of staying in my ear there were times that they would fall from the slightest sudden movement. For example, if something fell on the floor and I would try to pick it up, the earbuds would fall as well. Sounds quality was a bit off. Yes, they were loud, but it would sound as if I am listening to music from down the hall. Slight echo, and there was no way of fixing that. So I just returned them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds.... Great customer service,"Best earbuds I’ve ever owned. Great sound quality. They are also very good on noise cancellation as I use them when mowing the lawn.

Thanks TOZO!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Simplicity,"Easy to use, easy to pair and exceptional sound quality. The noise-canceling was better than I expected. These buds are loud enough for me but they aren't overly powerful. Fits good, although I have not tested their capabilities when doing physical activities, they are a snug fit. They do protrude out a bit more than I would like and are not comfortable if you try to lay your head to the side while wearing them.

These are precisely what I wanted. Very comfortable to wear at any time. More comfortable than Apple AirPods. I like the different sizes of ear plugs that come with the unit. Provides excellent fit. Great sound cancellation, as I have worn them while using machinery, and did not need additional hearing protection. Great wound with fuller sound than other EarPods I have tried. Love the charging unit, that quickly recharges the pods. Easy to connect to my phone, to listen to any program or music on my phone,  while swimming, working, or relaxing. Excellent product for the price. Considering buying one for my wife.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disappointed,"UPDATE: After 7 weeks and using them 2-3 times a week they no longer charge. They don't charge on the wireless pad or connected to a cord and I have tried 2 wireless pads and 5 different cords. Not sure if this is an isolated incident or not but I am waiting to hear back from Amazon and/or Tozo on how they are going to fix them.  Dead headphones arent very useful.

I needed something small and something that would sound good while I worked (painting and general house repairs) and while I am at my computer working. These seem to work well for both tasks. I just got them and haven't had a ton of time using them but the sound quality, which is the biggest thing for me, is amazing. The charging time and battery life are still being discovered but I used them for about two hours yesterday and never had an issue.

* I switched the earbud padding to the smaller size. It now fits comfortably in my ears, so I'm not worried about them falling out.

"Finally, wireless earbuds that fit and sound amazing","I spent more than $150 on wireless earbuds that did not fit well and/or sounded “weird” so I set my hopes accordingly. The first thing I noticed was that half the manual was dedicated to a detailed description on how to fit the device in the ear. They get it I thought. I will forgive missing functionality and or high sound quality for a good fit. I followed the detailed instruction and - a miracle, the units fit perfectly into their place. And the sound and isolation where better than all other wireless earbuds I tried. The connection to the device is seamless and consistent. The earbuds and the charger/battery have a clean and beautiful design. You can tell that they are maid with high quality material. The units snap into their slots in the charger.  The LEDs are clear and noticeable. The earbuds fit in and stay there. I tested that at the Gym and in long walks. I sweat a lot but while other devices stopped working these buds were not affected. Yes, you can’t control the volume from the buds but this is a really small detail compared to the fact that finally I have earbuds that perfectly fit and sound great.

The sound quality is great, they fit very well, and I love that the charging case is compatible with wireless chargers. The company even offered me a free wireless charging pad for the headphones.

"Simple, sleek, effective, and great for the price.","These headphones, for the price, are by far the best sounding / easiest to use. And the charging station is simple, effective, and sleek. They feel high-tech when you put them in, and with the right sized cushions (they come with four sizes, above and beyond the norm) they'll fit snug, stay bassy, and let you do even vigorous workouts without issue. I even could do handstands without them moving around. Really great for a pair. I will say that sometimes the left earbud's connection will duck out but it's only for a split second and doesn't happen often.

Sounds Great but died,"The description clearly says that they are waterproof. This is a falsehood. I had them in while taking a bath and of course, the right one fell from my ear while I was watching netflix on my phone. Yes, it plummeted to the bottom of the tub (A horrifying depth of about 18 inches) And by the time I got it dried off and reinserted into my ear? It was dead. I've tried everything to get it to work, but no. They are officially toast. Sucks really, because I loved those buds. I had them all of a month before this happened. Will not be purchasing another pair from this company.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice option; you should consider,So far very happy with headphones. I use for working out/running and they fit the bill. I wanted something that was quality without breaking the bank,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth The Purchase!,"These earbuds are great!! I ordered them on Thursday and they told me they would arrive by Saturday. I get home from work on Friday and there they are! A very nice surprise to see them a day earlier than expected. The sound quality is really good, especially for the price. When I'm wearing them properly, the noise cancellation is wonderful! I can't hear anything else around me. My wife and I both tested them out to see how well they stay in your ear once you find the right size earpiece, since they come with 4 different sizes. These suckers aren't going anywhere! They are perfect for a good session at the gym. The charging case is a great addition! You can see the charging indication lights through the case when it's closed. The case is small and most definitely travel friendly. It doesn't get in the way of anything at all! The battery life of both the case and the earbuds are much better than I expected. Normally when I get a pair of wireless headphones/earbuds, the battery life is quite disappointing. Not with these! The case charges them fast and they last for exactly how long I need them for and even longer! It doesn't take very long for the case to charge up as well, which is a huge plus.
The only thing I was iffy about while purchasing these was that I was thinking they would be bulky while they're in your ears and they would stick out far. It's not that bad at all. Much better than I anticipated.
Overall I am very satisfied with these earbuds and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

A solid pair of beginner Bluetooth earbuds for the $,"I decided to go cordless with my earbuds and saw the Tozo T10 as a highly rated and recommended product on Amazon. I did not want to spend the $150+ for the top tier earphones on the market so decided to settle on a pair of Tozo T10's. After using the product for a couple days, I can say that I do not regret the purchase. Going cordless has been a true game changer and these earbuds did not disappoint. The earbuds connect very easily with my laptop and phone and the sound quality is quite good. I have not tested its water resistant as I do not use these in the shower or go swimming often but I will trust the product's description and believe that it is in fact water resistant. The case that holds the earbuds is magnetic and the earbuds snap into place when putting them in the case. The charging port for the case is traditional USB type A but that isn't a big deal at all. Overall, the product is worth it for its price and I hope these last me a while.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth It!,"Straight of the box, I was impressed. The buds came charged! They magnetically fit into the charging case - I really like that feature. The sound is good -- I am not a expert though.

Impress with the quality/price,"I work out a lot & my previous headset died, likely due to continual perspiration when working out. Reading the reviews, I decided to purchase TOZO & test out the product. Currently, I'm impressed.  Since its waterproof, I'm hoping this headset will last longer than my previous one. Nice base & a crisp sound quality to it. It sits well in my ears. Overall, it's worth the price! No regrets at this time! Any issues arise, I will update.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality TWS earbuds that work as described,"I've had these for 5 months and I can say they are very well constructed and of good quality. The reason I gave these 4.5 stars is that I do wish they came with either ear hooks or ear wings as I am having to readjust them at the gym from time to time. As most earbuds of this type, they stay on due to a vacuum caused by the silicone ear tips.
This same vacuum is the sole cause for the noise cancellation, as most of the sound is blocked off from entering your ears. This means that you are not able to have a conversation with both buds in. The sound is decent, not comparable with Jabras or anything in the above $100 range, but if you are paying $50 for these then you should only expect decent sound. I use them mostly for podcasts and music streaming in the gym and they are fine.
Battery life is good, they last about 2.5 hours or so. The case does provide about 5 additional charges so the overall of 12-12.5 hours is accurate. The case does charge wirelessly and it charges up when plugged in a couple of hours. I have never had an issue with them pairing, from the time I take it out of the case and put them in my ear I always hear the ""connected"" voice prompt. I do have the occasional issue of the left bud temporarily loosing sound if my arm gets in front of it, when doing a movement like a front raise for example. The sound does come back once I lower my arm, so just a minor annoyance. I've watched Hulu, Netflix and YouTube videos with them and there is no latency.
I haven't tested the ""waterproof"" feature, mainly since Bluetooth does not conduct through water, I don't see the point. I do appreciate that I don't have to worry about the earbuds getting wet in the rain. Maybe I'll find out if they are really waterproof when I give these to one of the kids and the inevitably drop them in the pool.
Although they are very good, at this price they compare directly for the JLabs Air. My wife has those and the sleeve they come with do help keep them more secure. BTW, she previously had different pair of $50 TWS earbuds from Amazon but one of the buds stopped charging after about 2 months.
Overall I like these, but at this price they are right behind the JLabs mainly because of the readjusting I have to do at the gym. I guess the waterproofing and the wireless charging case makes up the difference. Maybe when I fish them out of the pool and they still work I'll up my score to 5 stars!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product,I ordered these to replace a different set of ear buds.  These are an outstanding set of wireless earbuds for the money.  They give good sound and the noise canceling is excellent.  They were easy to use and work well with my phone.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Everything I wanted in wireless Bluetooth earbuds!!!,"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Have not had one time where they felt like they were slipping out like some other wireless headsets I have had. Really helps with the comfort of wearing them also. Sound quality was very good. Found myself not needing to have the volume up as high as other wireless headphones. Thanks TOZO for knocking this out of the park!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Truly Wireless but terrible mid and bass, returning","Originally I had a positive review but I could not get used to the lack of bass and compared to my Bose headphones these things sound awful. One should also note that the companies warranty heavily pushes positive reviews by incentives (IE they will send a free charging plate).  This is mentioned as many of the reviews appear to be suspect.

Initial thoughts (revised):

Good:
- form factor is excellent
- easy pairing
- charging box is quick and easy

Cons:
- sound quality ( main reason for returning), treble is way to high and drums sound terrible. There is virtually no bass and mid . The sound is very shallow when compared to my Bose headphones wired and wireless.
- better ear bud silicon
- slimmer charging case would fit better in certain areas, comes with a cord, but it seems to heavy to conveniently cary at the gym
- dual / multi connection at once : These can only be connected to one device at time and is probably better on battery life. However, my bose soundsport can be connected to my watch and phone at the same time without problems.
- nitpick: treble is a little high and bass could be slightly deep
- be nice if an optional string could be attached to the headphones to link them together. This would be nice for draping them around my neck upon leaving the gym. Otherwise putting this in a pocket makes them super easy to forget about and possibly lose or wash.
- started having connection issues where the units get out of sync (left / right) .",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfort,"These headsets have been great so far. They were easy to pair with my cell and my iwatch. I love that they are wireless and the charging case is great as a carry case too. The product comes with four ear piece sizes, the current ones I am using were slipping on my last run, but I started with the smallest option. I am confident a larger size will fit more snug. I haven’t tried the earbuds in the pool yet, but plan to soon and I will update the review once I do.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They were great! For a week....,"*Well one star off, I have only had these earbuds since August 2nd, and now the left one cuts the music on and off, and cuts off my calls completely, and now the right bud disconnects. I am giving it one more shot before I give up on them.

I bought these by word of mouth. I was hesitant because many said they could not be used one at a time, which proved to not be true.

The sound quality is quite frankly, amazing. Even only having one in, it is crystal clear despite outside noise. With them both in, I hardly hear outside noises.

I used them all day, including during my hike and not once did I fear they were going to fall out. I am truly grateful they came with different size rubber buds, as one ear is slightly damaged inside, so the smaller rubber bud was a better fit.

Sweat was no longer a problem, my last pair of non wireless I was always having to remove and clean. These the sweat glides over it, and when I take them out, they are usually dry.

Setting up was a little annoying, but that was due to my excitement on using them.

As for using only one, both do have to be on, as the R is the master and the L is the slave. However, I just put one back in the case, still on, and let it charge there. So far, the beeping in the background has gone away after a minute or two. It would be nice if this was not necessary, but I am not going to complain beyond this.

Overall, even if it being just one day, I am damn happy I bought these.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"A novel concept, a product that works exactly as advertised.","The earbuds charged quickly and easily, popping right into and out of the charging box with a satisfying magnetic “snick.” The box was very small and easily fit into my hip pocket.
The fit of the product was quite remarkable-small enough to fit easily into the outer ear canal and light enough to stay there. The package comes with several different sizes of ear cushions to help customize the fit; the size that snaps onto the earbud is standard, the same size as many other in-ear brands, meaning you likely already have numerous spare pairs laying about.
The sound was great with clear highs and good bass response.
Overall great product and an even better customer service experience.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Convenient,Used this product to replace existing wireless ear buds that were connected with cord. This is much more comfortable. The only negative so far is there is not much bass in the sound.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice product but too many connection issues,I used these for running. They are lightweight and fit perfectly out of the box.  I never had an issue with them moving or falling except the one time I ran in the rain - then they slipped out slightly.  Good sound but a little bassy.  I ended up returning them because 20% of the time I would have issues with the connection between the two earbuds.  Sometimes it was sporadic enough I could deal with it but others it was so bad I took them out to finish my run.  If it was not for the connection issues I would rate 5 stars.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So awesome we bought his and hers!,"Was skeptical at first but the reviews were good and the price was right so we gave these Bluetooth earbuds a chance.  We bought one pair to try and they were so awesome my husband was like “I want a pair too!” So we got a set each and we love them.  I take mine with me everywhere.  They’re great in the car when I need to make a call, or at the gym and theses little things can really bump up the music! Noise canceling feature on these is not exaggerated.  Definitely want to get a wireless charging pad for them if you can because it’s easier to charge, because you just lay the charging case on it and go (and it holds a charge for hours and days if not in constant use) and the wireless charger pad is cool for your phone too so it’s nice to have.  So if you’re on the fence and looking for some new Bluetooth earphones, these are it.  I promise you won’t be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect!,"Just got this today and was happy with the product so far, the packaging was great everything was in there that was supposed to be. The sound quality really surprised me I was not really expecting it to be as clear and crisp as it was, the bass was great, well balanced. Once I found the correct ear piece they fit perfectly.

They seem to be working for what I need them to do.,"After the 3rd pair I received I finally received 1 that works.
I purchased a set and the right bud did not work at all. The 2nd pair Amazon sent me had good sound quality but I would receive interference and it would on get every other word in the song.
Amazon took the earbuds back and returned my money.
After a day or so I was contacted by TOZO.
They had seen my review sent me a pair that works. Thank you for that.
Sound quality is on par with my apple buds.
I only just received them and I will be using them in gym.
So it seems like the one that they sent me works well.
I gave them a 3 star now because I had so many issues initially. But they do have nice sound and lasts at least an hour in the gym and YES they are sweat proof so far!!!!

I don't usually get jazzed about products, but this one I really like. For the price it did not disappoint. The only thing is just be careful as they're easy to lose.

Exactly what I was looking for!!!,"I wanted some ear buds that I could wear out at the pool and could wear while driving.  I only wear one when driving so I needed to be able to use one at a time.  I can do that with this product.  Just picking up the right bud, and connecting it to my phone, it has a beep that is trying to connect the left for about a minute or so then stops.  I'm very happy with these buds, the are doing exactly what I wanted.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Convenient in every way with really great audio,"This was the first product that I really wanted to go out of the way to review the moment I turned them on. However, I wanted to give them some time to make sure that I would still be satisfied with them a few weeks down the line and all I can say is that I have never been more happier with a purchase. I really enjoy these.

The moment I tried them, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality as it was multiple times better than the wired earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy s9. With my previous earphones, I would still manage to have a hard time hearing the majority of audio even at maximum volume.
However, now using these, I rarely even find myself putting the volume above the standard warning you receive when placing the volume too high. Even with my volume halfway, I can hear the audio in the same way as if it were at full volume. On top of that, the quality of the bass was immediately noticable and made everything so much more better to listen to.

As well, many times before, I have found myself trying to find ways to where I could listen to music simultaneously while taking a shower or accomplishing other activities that tend to obstruct the clarity of music. With these, I don't have to worry about the possibility of my neighbors complaining about my music being too loud anymore. The fact that these are bluetooth and waterproof have really been useful to help cut out the middle man and take the music wherever I wish to listen to it. All without the cord in standard wired earphones getting caught up in things and getting tangled up by the time I pull them out of my pocket.

It comes with extra sillicone ear buds, a charging usb cable, and that fabric cord (I dont know what it's called) that is used for the wireless charging container to be hung with. The charging container itself is magnetic which makes the lid durable, and it makes its grip on the bluetooth earbuds firm enough not to fall out when placed inside to charger.

Some tips:
1. I'm not sure if it comes with a brick to charge but I use a standard phone charger with the usb cable it comes with
2. When taking them out to pair with phones, I sometimes have to take them out once, and instead place it back in to see the red lights, and take them out once more ready to be paired.
3. I use multiple devices to transition between, such as my phone and my laptop. So if I'm using my laptop on the bus along with these earbuds and need to put my laptop away when I am getting off, I shut off my laptops bluetooth first before putting it away, and then turn on my phone's bluetooth to connect it with the Tozo Earbuds.
And I do this process vice versa.

I really couldn't be more excited to recommend these enough times. Great product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great value wireless earbuds,"Having lost my second pair of wired earphone Jaybirds, I decided to give these a try.  I've had the Tozo T10 earbuds for 2 weeks.  My expectations were exceeded for price I paid.  I've used them running and cycling with good result.  Occasionally on my ride, the left and right will get out of sync for 10-30 seconds, giving a very slight echo affect but readjusted quickly.  Sound itself has been very good, I mainly listen to voice ( audio books and podcasts with a little music).  Ive done several calls with no complaints from callers.  T10s have been very comfortable, wearing them 1 -2 hours at a stretch with no issues staying in nor on battery life.  They charger case is great, enabling 3-4 full recharges.
Cons are very limited controls on earbud but mitigated by using phone to control  and no sound customization  (ie, no equilalizer to make tenor/base adjustments).

So far so good,Sound great and all functions work properly. A bit of trouble getting connected correctly but once I did they worked flawlessly.

I like that way they charge but they do not conserve power by going off automatically,"I purchased these after my $20 mpow headphones stopped working (after at least 2 years of daily use).  I was excited to have a pair of ear buds and these reviews were good so I spent the $50 and got these.  I have headphones in all night after I fall to sleep to an approximate one hour of playing podcasts while sleeping. I will say the sound with these is very good but they apparently don't power off on their own and I was startled awake with a ""Battery low"" message in the morning.  That's not going to work for me. I need a longer battery or they need to program them to go off after a period of non use to conserve the battery.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You get what you pay for. Not for iPhones.,"Edit: these will not stay connected to each other.

These headphones felt more expensive than they are. The volume is great. It would be better if double click skipped to the next song. They work great if you stay inside and sit still on the couch, unmoving. The minute I step outside with these, they constantly drop connection with each other and cut in and out. These headphones seem to work perfectly with my Chromebook but kinda wonky with my iphone. They are good for $30-40 headphones if you sit still in your house.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and listening time with fair pricing!,Like the sound of these. First time use after charging all was as advertised. Easiest pairing of more expensive brands. Second use left ear bud didn’t charge for some reason unknown. Put back in charger and disconnected charger from wired charging. This time left ear did not automatically pair up. Turned both off the back on again and all went well. What’s missing volume control feature and next or last song control. This seems to be a barrier for independent wireless ear buds I have tried even for those manufacturers of over priced brands like xFyro.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Shower with the music you like to sing with in your ears without a care in the world..,"Pros:
Sound quality is Great even when the volume is turned all the way up.
They can get vary loud. I normally have trouble hearing with headphones though I have to keep the volume turned down on these.
Batteries last longer than I expected for there size.
IP rating is great, haven't had any problems with them in the shower or the mud.
Wired and wireless charging is great, and I use both of them.

Cons:
Noice cancellation works but the noisier it is the louder you have to talk.
No volume or voice calling controls (Does have one click Answer and Hang up).
The case only recharges them about two and a half times.
Left earbud disconnects sometimes, mostly when I put my hand over my ear when scratching my head or when I lay on my side in bed the pellow blocks the signal.

Other thoughts:
They fell out of my shirt pocket into a mud puddle and I didn't realize it until I was about to leave the job site. Washed them off with bottled water and kept using them without any problems. Mud puddle was next to my truck where I hooked my hoses up. Lucky that was the only place I bent over at or I might not have found them. They were still turned on when I found them too. If these were Samsung headphones they would have been tost.

Lisa Yang left a comment complaining about the company telling them they would send them a free wireless charger if they posted a five star review. I got the same email and it didn't say I had to post a five start only they a had to post a good review to get the free charging pad. Well so everyone knows I already had multiple Samsung charging pads for all my devices so I don't need one from them I am simply posting a review so people that read Lisa Yang's reviews don't think the company is paying for five star reviews.
I am a Samsung fanboy but I do not own any of Samsung's wireless earbuds because the battery dies way to fast (excepton the new models), they have no IP rating (the new ones are rated at IPX2, wow trash), and they cost $130 vs Tozo IPX8 for $50.

If for some reason they do send me a wireless charging pad for this review, I will just give it away unless its a Samsung.

I have been vary pleased with these headphones and plan on buying five or more for family and friends that don't have bluetooth headphones this coming Christmas.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not too shabby earbuds,"I was looking into the market for some wireless earbuds for everyday use from driving hands free, working out at the gym, and I've even showered with them while listening to music. The sound quality is pretty good and they are pretty durable. Love the fact I can charge these on the go with the small charging case. It's always a must for me before I go walk my dog so I can listen to music and get some steps in. They last about a good 2 1/2 hours with a full charge. I've even watched a whole movie on my phone without the battery dying. Why are you still reading this review, still debating on getting apple airpods.

Love them!,These earbuds come with a few different sizes to fit different ear sizes. The earbuds are great at drowning out noise. When I put them in and turn on anything from a podcast to music it tunes out all other noise. They are great for bass playing as well. I have not tried to water proof aspect of it so I cannot comment on that part.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent Value, Great Features, Impossible to beat for the price","Right out of the box these come with must-have accessories: a charging case, three sizes of ear buds, a lanyard to attach to the edge of the case, USB charger and info about the warranty.

I've had these for about a month and so far so good. The battery life is about 3 hours as advertised and I can usually get 2-3 full charges out of the case. The most useful feature by far is the fact that you can use one headphone at a time as it doubles the battery life. Whenever one bud is low I swap it out for the other one. Though they say R and L you can easily put them in either ear.

Pros
Can use one at a time
great accessories
incredible price
sleek look
bluetooth connection is fast and reliable
decent noise canceling
wireless charger capability
Asurion warranty available

Great for exercise & motorcycle riding,"These earbuds are awesome! I use them everyday for working out and they even fit inside my motorcycle helmet! All other earbuds I've owned I always had to use full volume because they were so quiet, not with these. These I can't even go above 75% volume. They totally cancel any outside sound even when the volume is low, which is great protection for my ears from wind noise when riding on the freeway. I haven't had a chance to test the waterproofing but upon visual inspection they seem to be sealed very well. Would highly recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good value for price,"Although they don't look it, I seem to have very difficult ears to fit.  These work well and stay put, thanks to a variety of included tips.  The sound is also quite nice, although my chief use is with podcasting.  The only slight issues I've had with them is that once in a while, in their case and therefore theoretically off, they'll spring to life and connect to my phone, which then goes silent and creating a puzzle for me to solve; and they might occasionally hiccup the connection, reconnect themselves, and there will be a few seconds' phasing as they sync up again.  Not enough for me to be annoyed with.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good value, good sound","I'm a big fan of the Tozo T10 headphones.  I have bought 3 pairs so far for my family and I use them every day.  For the price, I don't think you can beat them--they are comfortable, simple to use, and high-quality.  If you push them down into your ears, the bass is excellent (if you just lightly put them in, you won't hear much bass at all, which is typical for ear buds).
The microphone performs well for phone calls, but in any place other than a silent room, I find it necessary to take the right earbud out of my ear and hold it in front of my mouth.  Otherwise the other person on the call can't hear me.  That's not great (because I have to use a hand to hold the earbud in front of my mouth), but I don't think there is much Tozo can do about that.
I have had difficulty with the wireless charging.  I told Tozo that one of my cases would not charge wirelessly (it still charges fine with a USB cable), and they sent me a new one immediately, which was great service.  However, the new case also does not charge wirelessly, which makes me think there is just something wrong with the design or the component or an internal connection (I have tried multiple charging pads, with the same result on all of them).  On the other hand, wireless charging is such a minor benefit (you have to plug the pad into a USB cord anyway, so might as well plug into the earbud case instead) that it doesn't change my opinion of the product.
I haven't tested how waterproof the earbuds are, but I do bike with them frequently, and they work absolutely great.  I put my iphone in the back pocket of my biking jersey (pro tip: put the iphone in a ziploc sandwich bag--now the iphone is truly protected from rain because there is no earbud wire to break the waterproof seal of the baggie) and the bluetooth works great with both earphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Just what I was looking for!,"After an extensive search for wireless headphone to workout with I came across these earbuds.

Worth it!,"Love that the case is a charger itself. The buds are very comfortable. I was worried they were going to fall out since I typically use the smallest size of buds for any typical headphones. Using the smallest buds on these ones, were no problem. I go to the gym and they dont fall out or move. I appreciate it that the case comes with a lanyard and that you can see the charge status through the case cover. The sounds quality is good for the price and quite loud. The bass is deep and sometimes muffled the songs but Im sure it because of the sound settings I have on my phone, which can be tweaked.

I only gave it 4 stars because you cant control the volume on the buds themselves, nor skip to the next song. All of this has to be done on the phone. Hopefully they add these features to the next one. But for 50 bucks its not a big deal.  Also, the sound quality when using the buds for a call is not that great but I personally purchased these for the gym.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Frustrating connection issues,"I bought a pair of these earlier this year and gave a 1 star review. This was mainly because the left earbud would constantly disconnect. The manufacturer told me I just got a defective pair, and that they would send a new pair if I was willing to delete my review. This seemed fair enough, and they quickly sent out a new pair once the review was deleted.

Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues as before, and I would recommend not buying these. The sound quality isn’t bad, but the non stop cutting out of the left earbud is a dealbreaker when it comes to wireless earbuds. I appreciate that they were willing to make this right, but 2 pairs of bad earbuds don’t help anyone. I highly recommend spending more on a better brand.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Decent for the price. 5/5 for customer service.,"EDITED: 5/5 stars for excellent customer service

Sound quality is very acceptable. Not perfect, but good enough for casual music and phone calls. My Note 9's speakers sounds significantly better, and when I'm on a call people say my cell phone's microphone is noticeably superior to the T10 microphone.

They were a bit of a pain to setup, but part of that was a problem with my phone, not the product itself. They sometimes automatically connect out of the case, but only like 20% of the time, and it's a little annoying to pair them. Have been using them almost a week and have had no battery life problems, but I also don't need to use them for more than 3 hours at a time, and any time I'm not using them, I put them back in the case.

There is somewhat noticeable latency when watching video on my phone or computer, maybe 50-100 ms. Pretty standard for ""true wireless"" headphones.

Really like the size and form factor of both the buds and the case, these are my first pair of wireless earbuds and I really like the freedom of not having a cable to break or get tangled.

No volume control.  I use them for running and gym.  They are a bit larger than I thought but fit in the ear well.  I run 3 to 4 miles and sweat and they stayed well in my ears.  Have to adjust to how they feel since there is no wire connection between the two ear pieces and you will have the feeling that they may fall out, so that is what you have to get used too.

Tozo10 Bluetooth ear buds are the perfect match for my lifestyle.,"I have been looking 6 years now for a way to go wireless with my phone and MP3 player.

The battery life is  pretty average at 2 1/2 to 3 hours of continuous use, so I have 3 pair and get through the day changing them out as  needed.  Pairing is super easy.  The sound quality beats any of the wired buds.  As expected, it took a few tries to get the best fit, but once I figured out which size to use,  I rarely have problems with them falling out.

"Great for music, bad for gaming.","I waited until I go the feel for these earbuds before I rated. After about a week and a half, here is my opinions.
Sound quality is great, it’s crystal clear, bass is just insane, and overall I enjoy listening to music far more on these than any other device I have. The only issue(which has passed) was when I first connected them to my phone and the left earbud kept cutting out. I think the issue is the right one being the master connected device. The left earbud connects to the right instead of the phone and seems to have a shorter distance it can travel from the right. Since I noticed that, it has been fixed. The comfort is good, it doesn’t fall out of my ears and it doesn’t hurt having them in for hours on end.

Verdict: if your using it for music, YouTube, Netflix, etc... it’s great. However if you are a gamer, and plan to use these on your pc or console, you need to look somewhere else. The audio is a good 2 seconds of delay for some reason.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't run with them,"Well I can say I did a bit of research regarding earbuds.  I needed a set of earbuds that would fit an active lifestyle in hot out door environments and pool time. Majority of the use would be doing long runs and lots of sweat and sun.  I also didn't want to have to spend all my petty cash on one product. Well these seemed to be the earbuds for me. I have to say,  with only one day of use I was impressed with the easy connection and sound quality. I went on a short 2.5 mile run. By mile 1,  the earbuds took turns falling out of my ears. I was not happy having to stop and pick up an earbud and continue running.  My run became a constant check and finger poking to keep the earbuds in place.

it could be that I have shallow depth ear canals. If you have deep set ear holes and some what on the large size, this may the the buds for you.  I am sorry to say that I just cant use them for the one thing i needed them for. Listen to music while running. I  think my brother (non runner and couch potato) will love these. Happy Birthday bro. You just got some earbuds. I am back to the long boring process of looking for another pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears while running .

If they would stay in my ears, I would be very happy and recommend them to friends.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for the price,Great sound. Relatively easy to connect. Didn't give 5 stars for 2 reasons:  1) ear bud sizes are difficult to change & 2)when u connect to just the right bud it beeps for about a minute.  Maybe this is a warning that you can't get rid of or I'm doing something wrong.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality,"For the price, you cannot beat these pair of wireless earbuds. They connect to multiple devices. So I listen to them on my laptop and on my phone when I receive calls. The call clarity, according to my friends, is very clear. They charge very quickly and what's more convenient is that they are wireless charging capable. They come with multiple earbud sizes and the case that they are carried in is fairly small.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great ear buds.. More than I expected!!,"Recently my Bluetooth broke and I was in the market for new one. I was on Amazon and saw this product and it had great reviews. I wasn’t really looking for wireless ear buds, but I said “ what the heck?” I received them yesterday and they were very easy to pair and the sound is awesome!! I would definitely buy more and tell people about them.. So far I have had a great experience with them!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bring Duct Tape!!!,The sound is good for the average ear. For the audiophile it scores a 4 out of 10. No way to adjust the EQ properly. The waterproof feature is nice for someone who sweats like me. The 3 ear sizes are not enough...as they keep dropping out. Nothing that duct tape can’t cure!,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Loses connection,"Great sound, deep bass and does a good job blocking outside noise. Call quality is great also. But they feel bulky and stick out in my ear. I feel them kind of slipping out slowly after a while of having them on but not to the point I feel like they’ll ever fall out. The buttons are quite harder to press compared to others I’ve used. Battery life per charge is ok but I’ve seen and used longer ones. But these are not the dealbreakers or the reason I returned them: they constantly kept disconnecting and reconnecting, especially during phone calls and that was very frustrating. I’m disappointed in that regard. Otherwise, these would have been some great pair of earbuds to have.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I am loving my TOZO-T10 IPX8,Just received my wireless earbuds. I have used it on my cellphone and now I am also paired with my laptop.

TOZO T10 for Me,"I liked that it is wireless. However, I was not able to use it as a BlueTooth because during phone calls the other person who I was talking to could not hear me.

A great product for the price and quality of the product.,I recently purchased these and so far they have been great. The sound quality is amazing and I love that they're so easy to use. Very pleased with purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Honestly a good company to buy from,I go to the gym everyday and I like to be able to have loud music and focus on me. These headphones have not been bad at all. for $50 they are better then expected so i gave the product a 4/5. why the overall review in 5/5 is because after a few months the case and everything just died out on me. I got hold of the company and they were very good about willing to send a replacement set for free. that to me speaks volumes.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Value Headphones,"Plastic case is quality.  Decent gasket/cover for charging port.  Good size.
Headphones come with a good number of tips for a good fit.  These are not noice cancelling, but with a good fit, they block sound as headphones should.
Sound and bass levels are excellent.

I'm really pleased with these headphones.

UPDATE 2019/9/25: After spending more time with the headphones,  I have decided they deserve 5 Stars.  I have worn them in the pool, in the shower while shampooing my hair, and while working out.  They stay where I put them and I were waterproof as described.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
OMG .. The Bass,"If you love deep, rich, booming bass, then these are for you.  This isn't muddled bass but strong, full sounding bass.  They are also very comfortable to wear ...I can keep them in for hours without fatigue.  Battery life is good (about 4 hrs), the volume is plenty loud at 50% ..and the charger case will charge wirelessly (or with included usb cable)  Three sets of tips included to insure a perfect fit.  These are comparable to my Bose Soundsports (really) at 1/4th the price.  Phone calls are clear.  I would of given 5 stars if you could advance tracks and control volume.
UPDATE:  I can't believe the fidelity of these earbuds.  Updating to 5 stars regardless of the advance track and volume control (or lack of)  These SURPASS my Bose SoundSport in every way ....comfort, bass, overall sound ...I can't describe the sound quality enough ....I must have 10 pair or more of wireless earbuds ...each almost hitting the mark ...these surpass the mark ...these will hit those sub bass notes ...and in a pleasing way ...they rival an expensive pair of over the ear headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great set of gym ear buds!,"I bought these as a replacement for another pair of ear buds.  These are waterproof and I get really sweaty when I work out, and these work great.

But for the price these things are amazing!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fit and battery life steal the show.,"When I received the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds I was quite excited. Most earbuds do not fit my ears well and the wires are always getting tangled during the times I use ear buds (yardwork, lawn mowing, rote work of almost any kind.) I found that the smallest of the included soft inserts enabled the buds to fit perfectly and close out a lot of the outside noise. The sound quality was excellent although I had to be careful where I carried my phone or the Bluetooth signal could get blocked. Most impressive was the battery life. I found that I could work for most of the day outside and not need recharge. I highly recommend these ear buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Well fitting, new name earbuds","For being a brand name I have never heard of these earbuds have really impressed. It comes with multiple sizes of interchangeable squishy ear peices, however the size that came pre installed works great for me. You could even use a different size for each ear if your canals are of differing sizes.

The charging case opens and closes using magnets, and the whole thing has a nice weight to it. It feels well made and durable for pocket carry. The earbuds click into their respective charging slots via magnetics as well.

Wireless charging works, as does the micro USB cord.

I primarily use these earbuds for playing TPP games on my cellphone like PUBG and watching videos. The headphones work great for this purpose and sound awesome.

I have noted some sound cutting in and out of the left earbud while laboring. I was shoveling snow from my driveway using them and noticed as I swung my arm it seemed to make the audio cut in and out of the left earpiece. The right remained constant. I attempted repositioning the source (my phone) closer to my head to account for winter layering. This did not help. I even re-established the Bluetooth connection multiple times with no avail.

For what I primarily use these earbuds for I remain happy with my product. Just been careful if you intend on primarily using them for work or exercise.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound - uncomfortable fit,"The sound quality exceeded my expectations. The bass was nice and clean with a good mixture of mids and highs. The case/charger felt solid with a magnetically closing lid.  The buds themselves were quick to charge and I had no issue connecting the ear buds to my computer via Bluetooth. Please note, the right connects to your device and the left bud connects to the right bud. You can use the right bud without the left, you can not use the left without the right.

I did find the ear buds to be a bit uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time (15+ minutes), even after trying the various sizes of ear pads that came the unit. This is probably a personal preference as other may find them comfortable. This is the only reason I'll be returning the ear buds.

The only major flaw is the charging cable that came with the unit, the cable is  too short. You'll need to be less than a foot away from any charging port using this cable. There is no wall adapter, you'll need to use your computer to charge or a separate USB wall charger.

Side note: when you choose to use only the right bud, it will beep for the first 30-45 seconds as it searches for left ear bud. After x amount of time the beeping will stop. If you want to use the left ear bud after using the right ear bud for awhile you'll need to turn off the right ear bud and then back on so it can search for the left.

Overall a decent product for a great price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really wanted to like these.. sent back.,"I own a pair of the Tozo T8's, had them for a few years and wanted to upgrade to something with more volume and better sound quality. I purchased the T10.  The build quality was impressive. The charging station, and earbuds in general were larger than the T8's, maybe something to do with the waterproof nature of them, maybe bigger drivers than the T8.  They did protrude from my ears much more than the T8, which I did not like. The sound quality was excellent. Very loud, good bass, good overall equalization, nice and balanced for such a small device.  The battery life was good.  I was VERY disappointed in the poor Bluetooth connection. The sound CONSTANTLY breaks up (doesn't disconnect entirely), to the point where I had to keep my phone always within 2 feet from where I was.  I couldn't even put my phone in my pocket or move my head from side to side.  Just constant , unnerving interruption..  killed my workouts!  I reset them as per the website instruction, I forgot device and re-connected, I shut bluetooth on and off numerous times. Nothing stopped the interruptions .  I have 3 other headsets and none of them do this. My T8s are better, my Jambuds (which hurt my ears) stay relatively breakup free within a decent range, my Vmoda Crossfades I can walk away 15 feet without an issue.. I literally had to hold the phone 1 foot in front of my face to get a decent constant connection with the T10.. even then it would sputter.  Sent them back, which stinks because I liked  the sound just fine.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great for music, Unusable for Phone calls","Good:
- Sound quality
- fit
- battery life
- case that stores battery and charges headphones

Bad
- microphone

These earbuds are great for running with music, even in the rain. However, if you're looking for a cheaper and less dumb-looking alternative to Airpods, these are not it. These are absolutely unusable for phone calls. The microphones are so weak that the other party can't hear you even if you're yelling. It's ridiculous.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for running!,"I have been eyeing these headphones for a long time and finally got some for my birthday. I was skeptical of their ability to stay in during running, but I have been BLOWN AWAY by their performance! They have stayed perfectly in place for all of the runs I have used them on. They are very noise canceling, so I only use one for running. I love that I can use just one ear bud and not have to worry about the other bouncing around since there aren't wires! The sound quality is pretty good, and so far I haven't had any issues with battery life.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are great for what I need them for,"got these for my hour long bus commute and couldn't be happier.  While they are good for sitting on the bus or walking to my office, they are a little bit on the chunky side, so I don't thing they'd be good for jogging or running .

"Don't stay in ear, stopped working after 5 months.","I have had these headphones for less than 6 months and they already stopped working. The left headphone went out and the right beeps the entire time. When I tried to run with the headphones they always fell out; even after using the different earpieces.

I recommend spending the extra money to purchase the bose wireless headphones. They are much higher quality and stay in your ear without causing irritation. If there are any issues Bose will replace the headphones without question.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for a great price,"I have never used bluetooth headphones or earbuds. So I thought I would give these a try after watching multiple reviews on YouTube. ToZo had high ratings on most review sites and I can ""hear"" why. The sound quality is excellent. Great bass. The charging case is compact and easy to use. I have not evaluated the noise cancelling ability, but gave it four stars anyway. It did take several attempts to get the buds to pair and then pair with my new phone. I believe this was due to my inexperience,  so you may need to attempt pairing multiple times. However, once accomplished, the buds pair quickly and the music sound is excellent. You will not regret purchasing these little gems. I am a happy customer and kudos to ToZo for their quality product at an excellent price point.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the price,"I’m not sure how these headphones are getting the reviews they are getting. I’ve purchased three headsets, prices varying from $35 to $45 dollars, and in my opinion, they’re not worth it. The good in these headsets is that they sound pretty good. There’s a good range of lows, mids, and highs. They’re cordless. And they’re water resistant (I’ve showered in the pair I use). However, the bad news is that they are useless for phone calls. If you try to use these to talk on the phone, the person on the other end can’t hear you. This is a big negative for me because I like to be able to work at the computer while I’m talking on the phone. Also, the battery life is inconsistent. Some days I get a few hours of use, but most days I get an hour or two before they’re telling me the power is low. This is after they’ve been on their charger and plugged in all night. I’m getting the same review from the two other people I’ve purchased these for. In the end, I’ve had much better Bluetooth headsets, for more than half the price of this pair. When it’s time to get new ones, I’ll be looking elsewhere.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for the money,"I had wanted truly wireless earbuds for some time, however did not want to pay $150 or more for a pair.  Then I saw these and figured for the price I could not go wrong.  I was absolutely right.  These are great little earbuds.  The sound quality is actually pretty good and the battery life is about 3 to 3.5 hours and I find the case very convenient. I have had them a few months now and I think they are great for the office or the gym.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product!,"So far so good. I have only had these for roughly a week and love the sound quality from these. I have yet to put them to the test with the waterproof feature. I was able to connect both sides to my phone easily. One of the things I liked is that these came with different sizes (the piece that goes in your ear) so you can find the right fit. These will more than likely be used at work where the wireless feature will come in handy. I, so far, recommend these for those who want true wireless headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best of the $50 earbuds.,"I tried 7 different sets of “cheap” earbuds (around $50), and the TOZO T10 are the best of them by far.  I got the grey pair and they look amazing and not cheap at all.  The case while kind of big feels very solid.

Good sounds value but not worth the side problems.,"It can in fact be used in the shower for example and sound quality is definitely worth the price.

But I have big problems.

Horrible connection. The headphones randomly and abruptly lose connections and lose sound while being connected and on full charge. This happens almost everyday. I’m holding my phone or am right in front of my computer screen  and the sound just goes away and stutters for unknown reasons.

Wish I could return and get my money back",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Just not a good value,"I bought these trying to get a cheaper solution than the better engineered competitive products that are also 3x or 4x the price.

My key complaint is the fit.  They seemingly need to be pressed hard into the ear canal when worn.  This has caused irritation / pain when I have used them.  Further, they fall out intermittently.  I bought them to use while working out so this was a real pain.  I ended up bringing them to my work as kind of a backup pair of headphones but for the most part know I will never use them again.

The battery life and sound quality are average.  Nothing special about these except for the cost compared to similar products.  If you feel you will lose them often, this might be a better option.  Otherwise, you should probably do what I eventually did and just bite the bullet on a nicer pair",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It was an amazing decision to buy these earbuds!!!,"This earbuds are excellent. These are my first earbuds, and I can say that they work really well. First, the presentation of the package is very professional compare with other earbuds I have seen. Second, they fit really well in the ear. Last, but not least, they sound really clear. The only inconvenience is that you can only play/pause and answer/hang calls, there is not skipping songs or listening previous song.

Pairing with my LG G4 is always fast and easy.  The sound is exactly what I was looking for.  Charging is quick and easy with the provided USB charger as well as the wireless charging capabilities.  With the 3 different size ear pieces along with the ones that are on the ear buds already you have 4 different sizes so finding the right size for your ears should not be a problem.

I use these mostly for work so I am able to keep working while taking phone calls and listen to music occasionally.  I use these intermittently for an hour or two at a time and I went 3 days between my first and second charge.

Best earbuds I’ve purchased!,"These are by far the best earbuds I’ve purchased (and I’ve gone through my share). I’ve had them almost 2 months. I use them daily at work to listen to podcasts, roughly 20 hours of use weekly. I only use one earbud at a time and at the end of the day put it back in the case. I only charge the case maybe once a week. The batteries have never ran dead on me so it could go longer between charges. For me that was enough to recommend these to others. But a few days ago I put one of the earbuds in my jeans and one thing lead to another, two full wash cycles later I found the earbud still in the washer.

Overall great and easy to use but with sound inconsistencies,"These headphones are really great for overall usability and sound. I mainly use at the gym, but the pairing is really quick and automatically connects when you take the headphones out of the case. Charging case is amazing, and I've not yet had any issues withe battery life despite heavy daily use (>4 hours at high volume every day) as it charges every time it's in the case.

The only issue I've had so far is when the headphones switch between ""music"" and ""phone"" mode. E.g. if you make or receive a phone call while listening to music, the headphones seem to activate another function to engage the microphone function and settings that are optimized for calls. If you then go back to listen to music, the sound quality is HORRENDOUS. The included instruction manual did not mention this potential issue nor how to switch between these modes. However, I have found the best fix is to put the headphones back in the case and then take out again.

Great quality but short battery life.,"In the last two years I have bought 3 pairs of over the ear head phones as well as two sets of wireless ear buds and a pair of the sports buds that have hooks to go over your ears and have a wire connecting them to each other. For one reason or another each of them hasn't worked for me. These are really high quality, fit perfectly in my ear- even if I jump around, have really good sound quality and are light weight. The problem? A three hour battery life. UGH! I need something that will last 6-8 hours as I listen to a rain program while I sleep at night to drown our a snoring partner. I'm so frustrated that I can't find something like that without spending $200!! Crazy! I guess most people must buy these for working out, but some of us have other needs.

still working after washing them,"So I don't really have a break down of pro's and con's for this, so I'll just lay out my thoughts.

First and foremost, I accidentally left these buds in a pair of pants, and ran them through the wash. After blowing out some water, and resetting the headphones, they are still working 2 weeks later. I also wear them to the gym, and sweat all over them, so the water proof part seems to be true.

sound quality is somewhat hollow, but I only really notice it on songs with a heavy baseline. This is to be expected with the size of the ear buds though.

Battery life is 3-4 hours of continuous use, and does not seem to change much when making phone calls. I wasn't sure what to expect exactly as this is my first pair of headphones like this .

Once in a while I experience an issue with the connectivity between left side  earbud (the client), and the right (the hub). This usually only happens when I take one bud out to readjust, and just has to do more with the distance between the two buds. anything more than about 18"" and the signal on the left earbud starts to cut out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent design and performance,"These are really nice earbuds.

I wear different pads (Comply) on my earbuds and the pads I had on my old earbuds didn't fit into the charging case (which is similar to this one) and it was a hassle to always take the pads off and replace them during the charging process. The pads totally fit inside this case and this saves me a step.

The sound quality is better than I expected. The bass is good and the treble is a little high but I think that's more a function of what I'm listening to (podcasts and the like).

These fit in my ear nicely and aren't heavy at all. Set up/pairing was easy.

The charging case comes with a USB cord so I can just plug it in and forget about it.

All in all this is a great value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Might not fit your ears,"I purchased these because i really wanted airpods but didnt want to spend AirPod money. The good thing about these headphones is that they dont really fall out. The charging case is great and lasted me my 17 hours flight back home. And the ear piece was great for your ears popping on the plane. The bad is that they don’t really have the best sound quality. And i think this is mostly because of the second reason they didnt work for me, which was they’re to big. I really had to shove them into my ear to make it work. And of course they slid out. I ultimately had to return them and still get air pods. But i think they might work best for someone with bigger ears. For $50 they’re okay, but ive purchased other headphones off amazon for $20 with better sound quality and better fit so im not impressed.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
microphone is subpar,"Everything is fine (sound quality, charger, pairing, etc.) except the microphone. People said it sounds like I'm far away.

Great product for the money,"These earbuds are great for the money.  Very good sound and comfortable fit.  I use them to run and they stay in and sound great.  Only complaint would be battery life -- I only get about 3 hours of listening before a recharge is required.  The good news is recharge is usually very quick.
Update:  I had an issue when the right bud stopped working.  I contacted customer service and they immediately apologized and sent out a new pair.  I had them in just 3 days from initial contact.  I really appreciate customer service like this!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Waterproof, but only can connect to one side at a time","The Bluetooth can only connect to either the left or right earbud, but not both. Therefore, I would not recommend it if you intend to use it primarily for music as the sound quality is not good with only one earbud.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Excellent Product, Worth the Cost, Great Sound.","Great fit and fairly comfortable.  I say fairly as the do get a touch uncomfortable after wearing them for a couple hours (this is in the outer ear only, not in the ear canal...  that never got uncomfortable).  Regardless, I would definitely buy these again.  The cost and the quality are well worth it and they sound awesome too.  Good bass, Clear sound and they can get LOUD, so no worries there.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for the price - Decent Battery Life,"I have been using these earbuds for a week now.  Pretty good battery life. I like how the buds snap in and out of the charging box. Comes with 4 different size of ear plugs to make sure you get the right fit. Build quality is good at this price.

Only reason to give 4 stars is when the battery life reduces below 50%, I have had people complain while on phone call that my voice sounds either distance or muffled (happened twice in last 1 week).",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best headphones I have owned!,"I love the tozo earphones! This is the 2nd pair of tozo t-10s i have bought and I bought 3 pairs of tozo t-8s. (I drop stuff very easily and I'm a mechanic on buses so I constantly have to take them in and out and put them down so I lose them easily. I lost one because it rolled out of a bus as I was driving. Yes i am that bad lol) I will be sitting at my table with them in listening to music and my family tells me they are talking to me for like a minute before they realize I can't hear them, great noise cancelation! Great sound quality! I love that I can connect one at a time, again bus mechanic so I can't have both in at work at the same time so I can hear if they are calling me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good for swimming laps,Can not be used for swimming. First of all a bathing cap pushes the large buds against the ear. Then the minute I turned my head to side right ear went out then left. So I had to get out of water to reset Bluetooth for right ear. Bud never recovered and earphones went back. Waste of money and time. Clearly the Bluetooth wouldn’t work from one end of pool to another. Don’t understand who wrote these stunning reviews but the were not good for swimming.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound,"The sound quality is the best I've gotten out of any earbud I've ever used. Not an obscene amount of bass that I have heard in other type of buds. It can get plenty loud when you need to. The noise cancellation isn't the greatest but it is far from bad in my opinion. Loud noises can still get through, but for the most part I'm just into the things I'm listening to and it doesnt bother me. As far as wireless earbuds go it's not bad. I get about 2 - 3 hours before needing to charge, and the charge pretty quick.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product,"I am giving a 5 star review, because the product was not bad, the easiness to deal with merchant as far as getting the product, time of shipment, refund questions, and process.

Bot impressed. Buy cheap buy twice.,"Upate from my previous review. Originally gave a 5 star but after using for a few weeks I am not happy. The ear buds cut out if you phone is not in the line of sight. Sometimes it works when in your pocket...not well in your back pocket...sometimes not even when it's in your back pack.

I wasn’t expecting much for $50,"I recently purchased these headphones as my wireless Bose headphones stopped working. I was happily surprised when I turned them on and they played loud, crisp music. The wireless charging case is super nice too because I was worried about losing an earbud, but now I don’t have to worry since they can be stored safely in there. And they don’t fall out during my workouts (which I am constantly jumping/moving around quickly).  So far, I love them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good customer response_but for use in bed,Since my initial feedback I had a quick and full response and refund. I appreciate the rapid response to my concern.

Pleasantly surprised,"I am thrilled that these are such good quality for the price.  I've been shopping for a few months and really didn't want to pay the average price of $125 for earbuds.

"Easy to use, loud","I use these for running and also to cancel out snoring noises from people sleeping next to me. They stayed in my ear during a 20 minute run, and the bass is very satisfying for such small earbuds.
One thing I don't like is the constant flashing lights, they can be disturbing when trying to sleep and wake up my partner too.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound is amazing,"I love these wireless earbuds. I've always wanted to go wireless, but wasn't sure how they would sound or fit, or how well they would keep the connection to my device. (I use them with both a Samsung Galaxy S9, and an iPod Touch.) But I finally decided to go for it, and it was the best decision I ever made in the headphones area. The only drawback, and my #1 concern, was battery life, something you don't even think about with a wired set. Good thing is, it charges very quickly. But I'll probably get a second pair to use while these charge. I use them for 12 hours a day, and I can't go back to wired headphones. These things have spoiled me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You get what you pay for.,"When they worked the sound was great, battery life was acceptable, and noise cancelation was adequate. However, to keep them connected a line of sight was needed. While at work if my phone was in my pocket and I leaned against anything the connection would drop. If I left my phone on my tool box and went under a vehicle the connection would drop. They fit well and never had an issue with them falling out but they would cause fatigue. I couldn't wear one long enough for the battery to die before the pain from fatigue would cause me to remove  them. Lastly, you can not use the left one without the right being on also. The right is the master and the left is a slave, can not charge the right and listen with just the left. Ultimately returned them and forked over the extra for the samsung buds. No complaints now.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good purchase for the money,"This was a great purchase for what I'm looking for in inexpensive earbuds. Very good sound quality. I've only tried one other pair ( apple styled soundpeats ) which were actually very good but lacked the bass quality I was looking for. I settled on the Tozo T10 because of the number of reviews. Not disappointed one bit. Keep in mind these are not audiophile quality, but they do the job very well. The other reason was because I could select which earbud to listen through which the soundpeats only allows listening thru the right earbud. All in all I would recommend this for gym or casual listening as they stay in my ears very well.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great aearbuds and a Good Value,My first Bluetooth earbud purchase. I have used Bluetooth earphones but not earbuds. The earbuds are easy to insert and automatically turn on and pair when removed from carry case charging doc. Earbuds stay in my ears with no movement. I love the charging case! After I am through or get a low battery signal just place them in the case and they are recharged. Eventually you have to charge up the carry case which can be some wirelessly or by using a cable which comes with which can be hooked up to a computer or your phone charging power plug.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great but maybe not if you have really small ears,"I really like this earbuds, used them today for the first time to go to the gym and they never fell, never got lose, didn’t even have to accommodate them. I had a hard time pairing initially but it’s my fault for not reading instructions.

They fit perfectly on my ear (didn’t even have to change the tips) but I had my husband try them on and looks like his outer ear is just smaller and looked all funky and he said he feels they would fall so maybe if you have small ears (where the outer portion of the earbud would sit) this is something you might want to keep in mind.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Very good music quality, can't skip songs.","They're super nice! I'm a person who needs a lot of bass. These absolutely kill the low end. I played a bass clip on youtube and nearly died from the bass. I love it. The music quality is top notch.

I haven't tested out the waterproof on them.

The button on each is super nice for pausing songs, however this leads to....

My only complaint.
Pressing the button twice does NOT skip songs. Instead it redials the last number called. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS! It lead to a very awkward conversation with my professor.

In summary, worth the money, incredible bass, can't skip songs,",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Ear Buds with quality sound!,"Purchased these ear buds last month and couldn't be happier with them! I was surprised how well they sounded, and provided a punchy bass.

Comfortable and convenient,"They have great sound quality and have a better battery life than I expected. They also seem to charge very quickly. The buds stay in my ears very well during running and are comfortable to wear.

I was immediately impressed with the quality. The box, the charger, the earbuds themselves, all very good quality. I use them while working out, and have zero issues with them falling out of my ears.

The only thing I would say is that the bass is not the greatest, but that's honestly to be expected at the price point. All in all, very pleased with the purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Absolutely Amazing Earbuds!,This purchase was a impluse buy. I was unsure if they would fit my ears or if the lack of sound quality would be an issue. But after reading a few reviews I went with it.

Don't use at busy gyms!!!,"When I first looked at the reviews and how many of them I thought, this looks like a great cheaper alternative to Apple airpods especially since I have a Samsung device. When they came in the mail they were very sharp looking. The case looked good and came in a nice sealed plastic covering. I really liked the wireless charging feature since I have a charging pad for my S9. I charged them for the time suggested (around 4 hours) and proceeded to use them in the house. They were a little bulkier than I anticipated for being in your ear but they stayed in my ear pretty well. Don't try to compare them to Airpods as they aren't as sleek and the case isn't either.

Pairing was easy and worked well. You pair the R earbud to the phone and the L earbud pairs to the R earbud. Walking around the house with my phone in my pocket the sound in my L earbud fluctuated a bit but I didn't think anything of it. I then went to the gym during the week at a busy time. I had a pair of LG headphones ($100) that fell apart after about 1 year and I didn't want to wait for warranty.

When I got to the gym, the L earbud started to cut out constantly the entire time I was there. It was very frustrating. This happened to my LG headphones so I thought maybe its just my phone or my mobile data. To figure out if that was true or not, I switched to the gym wifi and still same issues. I held the phone close to the earbuds and it got a little better but still cut out constantly. Very much a distraction. I then thought maybe it was my phone even though its a Samsung Galaxy S9. I used my wife's Samsung S9 and also my dad's Samsung S10 and they all did the same thing. Cut in and out during every song and the R earbud would sometimes fluctuate or cut out because the L one was doing it.
I unpaired and repaired the earbuds several times while at the gym to no avail. I know this can't be a problem with other headphones because I don't see other people fooling around with their headphones the entire time at the gym, just me. I read more reviews on these and found the same issue with other people at a busy gym. I'm not switching gyms just to be able to use these earbuds so I proceeded to return them.

I purchased the Mpow 059 bluetooth headphones which are cheaper and according to them older bluetooth technology than these Tozo earbuds. I didn't want to switch to over the ear headphones but they work so much better than these Tozo earbuds. They had a lot of potential but so disappointing that they didn't work.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Does What You'd Expect,"Pros: multiple ear bud sizes, great sound quality, lightweight, awesome charging port
Cons: Short battery life, might find yourself pushing them back into your ears a couple times during a workout

I use mine at work and during the gym. They are a great size. They stay pretty hidden and never bother me- except they do slip out of my ears slowly while working out. I did not want to own earbuds with the ear hook, so I don't mind the slight slipping. Overall really happy with the purchase. They connect to each other and my phone within 3 seconds of being out of the charging case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The sound is ok,"Well, you get what you pay for. The sound is ok (my $12 wired Panasonics sound slightly better) and they're very light and comfortable, however I've only had them for 7 days and unfortunately these headphones have a bad habit of fading in and out when walking, on both ears.... not just the left side as other reviewers have indicated. Having said that, I discovered that they only do this when my phone (sound source) is in my back pocket (where I prefer it) and not if it's in my front pocket or if holding it while walking. Very inconvenient for me. Debating on returning them since the manufacturer has mentioned in other reviews that some may be defective.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"They're ok, but...","I gave 2 stars due to the price. Opened the box, charged (wirelessly, nice) and went on a 12 mile run. No problem staying in ears. Stayed connected to my Samsung galaxy watch with Spotify (nice). Listened until they died...3hrs total. (Decent, would like 5-6hrs).
The big problem came the next day, with a full charge. Started a run, and earbuds kept going in and out. I've had them about 3 months now and still same problem. They work not further then a meter out from the Samsung watch, or 2 meters from Samsung S9 phone.

Pretty good for the price,"I love that these are waterproof; they have transformed my shower time! :) I like that they come with different sized adapters for the earbud part to make sure they fit. I have a couple of complaints, the first being that it seems to have a relatively short battery life (seems to range from 2-3 hours, less than some other bluetooth headphones I use). My second issue with them is that I like to use only one earbud at a time (like at work or when I need to keep one ear open, lol), but if you don't have both earbuds powered on at the same time, it will beep looking for its partner. It would be nice to keep one charged while I use the other one, but I guess that is more a personal preference than a design flaw.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not great but also not awful - Very middle of the road,I don't understand how overwhelming positive the review of these ear buds is. These fall out of my ear after 15-20 minutes. The sound for phone calls is great and this is a productive tool to have for work. For music? No way - Garbage. I compared my traditional apple ear buds that came with my phone and other wireless head phones that I have and it is night and day. This product lacks the bass. Battery life is also not great. The price should be lower. After using these I should have just sprung for air pods and paid more. They look cool and the charging dock is nice.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Yeah... that gets old really quick. I have a new Samsung S9 so I figured they would work fine, and they did if you're buying these to listen to music at home, alone, and you can breathe very shallow and not move.

Bluetooth Earbuds that Fit Great and Don't Break the Bank!,"I use bluetooth earbuds to listen to podcasts when I'm virtually doing anything during the day. I needed a pair that would stay in comfortably, pair automatically, and charge without any issue.

I owned the SoundPeats brand that were good, but the charging station was not the best and it was incredibly difficult to pair the two together. These Tozo earbuds are far better in comparison and the cost is similar. They pair to your phone automatically when taken out of the charging station, have a magnetized charging station so there is no missing the charge adapter, and have multiple ear pieces to accommodate all people.
Don't hesitate, pick these up if you want a pair of affordable earbuds that won't frustrate you on the little things that break over time. Plus they come in multiple colors which is a nice option.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value ear buds for general purpose use.,"I purchased these as value earbuds.  I use the for phone calle and audio books mainly, and sometimes music, but I have over the ear headphones for when I really want to listen to music.  These fit me well, and sound good for the price.  There has been a delay or echo a couple of times, like there was interference between the left and the right earbud, so I can’t give them 5 stars, but it was brief and my expectations are not perfection at a value price, so I only knocked off one star.  There were many different sizes of ear canal pieces, and I tried them all on and settled on a good one for me.  I only do light walking and jogging, and have not tried swimming or showering with them on so cannot comment on their waterproof capabilities.

The company has had fast service, shipping, and communication.  I am happy with them and would purchase from them again.

Overall, so far, I am pleased.  I have only had them a few weeks, so we’ll see how long they last.

(Update!) Battery drain is the Achilles heel,"Update (11/3/19): Tozo customer service reached out to me and offered to replace the T10 earbuds with the newer T6. Their customer was very helpful and was great at communicating throughout the process from their initial contact. I have adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars based on their customer service.  I will review the T6 once I have some time to break them in.  I stand by my initial 2 star review of the product itself, and hope the T6 is a higher quality product.

For $50 these have a good sound, fit in ear well and when they work properly they're a fantastic value.  However there are issues that make me regret this purchase.  First, the battery in the charging case drains within 2 weeks, EVEN IF, the case is fully charged.  I use these mostly when I mow my lawn.  When I finish mowing I put them in the fully charged case and put them back on the shelf for next week.  I have been charging them every other use, so I'm depending on the case to provide at MAXIMUM two full charges to the earbuds between charging the case.  It seemed to work at first, but after several months of use, the earbuds are dead when I go to use them.  So now after every use I'm required to put them in the case, then plug the case in until the case is fully charged.  This cannot be by design as it makes the case essentially useless other than as storage.  Second, the left earbud disconnects at random several times during my roughly 1 hour of use.  Third and finally, when I go to use them I take out the right earbud first, as instructed, then I'll take out the left earbud AFTER the right earbud connected to my bluetooth source.  This fails to connect both earbuds 25% of the time, and I have to set both earbuds back in the case and try to start all over again.  Ultimately this comes down to ""You get what you pay for.""  I regret this purchase and should have spent the extra money on a higher quality set of wireless earbuds. 2/5 stars.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Hurts the skin of your ears. Ugh,"The only.negative about these are the ear cushions themselves.  There is a molding nit line in the middle of the silicone. So it scrapes your ear putung then in and removing them......  Ive been using them for about a month now and my ears are so sore... even with the smallest pair supplied....
Worst design flaw by far.  I'll be purchasing different ear pieces  Other than that.. they work well for the price.....",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They work for everyday use and the gym.,"I have been impressed with the earbuds. I use them for the gym mostly and the single right unit for navigation when needed. The battery life is great for what I have done so far.  The sound quality is perfect with the ability to adjust just by changing the angle. I have been in to music ""Vocals"" and performance for  a long time so have a tuned ear for audio reproduction. These earbuds were a great choice as I spend a number of hours on Amazon researching before purchasing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
LOVE THEM!,"I was looking for noise-canceling headphones to use when traveling but was hesitant to buy a pair of wireless earbuds because I thought that they would be expensive (on the order of over-the-ear headphones), uncomfortable, and difficult to connect to my various devices--an Android phone, a Chromebook, and a Windows 10 laptop. But when I saw the thousands of great reviews of this product, I decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and ease of set up. The phone was the easiest to set up, but I was able to connect the other devices fairly quickly. The sound and noise-canceling are great, and I found a comfortable set of tips among those included with the product. I've only used them once for exercise, but the waterproofing seems fine. It was 50 bucks well spent to get rid of annoying wires and bulky headphones!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent purchase of quality sound; comfortable fit; and well built earbuds,"My stars don't really qualify at this time as i've only used these ear buds for two days now. Wanted to initially comment on the timely shipping and physical quality of the product as I've enjoyed them so far. Sound quality is AWSOME! Connectivity, a breeze! The earbuds themselves feel light, comfortable and very well built as opposed to others I've had that feel hollow and cheap. No fear of them accidentally falling out of my ear during the most vigorous of tasks so far. Looking forward to more hours of use. I'll tell u how it goes.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound is great. but microphone mehh,"I bought this product to serve as a listening device with ability to have wireless phone conversations.  I must say that the sound is great with great deal of noise cancellation.  However, it's tough to talk on the phone as you tend to hear yourself more with both earplugs in, but I tend to use one ear bud during calls to alleviate this. Callers have also complained that they can't hear me well.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are great!,"I really liking the Tozo T10 earbuds. The case and earbuds are lightweight and small making it convenient to just have in my pocket all the time. One feature I particularly like is that I can use one earbud and still use the pause/play button. I know that usually standard feature, but my last $50 bluetooth earbuds didnt do that, weird. Again I think it's a great product. I havent had it long but works wonderfully. The sound is by far the loudest I've heard so far from bluetooth earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfort and Great Price,There aren't words to tell you how impressed I am with the comfort of these earbuds I can honestly say that I usually forget they are even in my ears.  I have longer hair that covers my ears and with the size of these earbuds no one can even see them.  I work in an office and generally only use one earbud during the day so that I am still able to answer the phone and hear conversations clearly.  I like being able to enjoy music while at work while still showing respect to coworkers by not interrupting or distracting them.  I am so thankful for finding these earbuds.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Real Pleased,I bought two of these and so far so good. They paired to my iPhone as advertised. Today I used them for a two run and they stayed secured and no moving around. My daughter enjoys them and she uses them more throughout the day. We are real pleased with our purchase.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High Quality & Affordable,"I bought this product after my older pair of wired ear buds broke. The left ear bud broke in half from me dropping it while running on a treadmill. Anyway, I decided to go with this product after doing a little bit of snooping around. Right out of the box, it was just as easy as they claimed to pair the headset with your phone. Took no more than 5-10sec. The sound quality was much more acoustic than my old wired pair. This is my first wireless pair ive bought and i couldnt be happier. The thing that i was really satisfied about also was how they fit in my ears. Ive had trouble in the past with finding comfortable earbuds and ones that stay snug in your ears (especially while exercising). Ive went for a run with them recently and they didnt budge one bit! The fact i didnt feel the need to adjust them at all during my run was huge. Definitely would recommended these to anyone looking for a decent pair of earbuds and affordable cost.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
All the bangs for your bucks.,"These are hands down the best headphones I've ever owned. The sound is great, all my music is super crisp! It's even got me liking songs I normally wouldn't.

My only cons are the battery, I wish they lasted longer than 4 to 5 hours but that's okay, the fast charging battery and portability of the charger really makes up for it. And the fact that I can't just have the right (master) out of the charger without having the left out. The (master) just keeps beeping until I take the left one out of the charger. Maybe I'm not doing something right.

You're getting a lot of bang for your buck with these. Thank you reviews for helping me make a decision and thank you TOZO for making great headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and quality customer service.","I grew tired of having the wires of my previous ear buds catch on drawer knobs and god knows what else so I resolved on buying some wireless ones (i.e these). While I can't attest how waterproof these are (I'd rather not test it all), I can say with confidence that these quality ear buds that are easy to sync with any bluetooth capable device and the case that comes them makes it easy to both store and charge them. By the way, the batteries in these usually go for about 4-5 hours and take about half a hour to charge (give or take).
The only downside is that I recently one of the ear buds, one of the fears that kept from going wireless sooner. So I contacted customer support and after a brief email  exchange I had a replacement bud mailed to me in under a week.
In conclusion, I'd highly recommend these to anyone willing to spend the money on them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excited I purchased them.,"I was honestly not expecting these headphones to sound this good. The quality is great. I  work out a lot and having headphone that stay in my ear the whole time is a God sent. And , they are water proof, even better. I like that they come with multiple bud sizes, so I can fine the right size for me. Con: changing the earbud inserts, this can become difficult at times, so choose the right bud for you.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality.,"First off,

Understand, my wife owns apple air pods. I loved them but I can’t use them when moisture might be present. (I like to wear them while cutting grass or working out).

Aside from that I would still put these Tozos up against apple any day for sound quality.

They paired easily with my IPhone XR and the battery lasts for a while. The case doesn’t feel cheap or loose. The magnets are strong and durable. I’m sure these will last me a few years to come.

Over all, I’m a huge fan.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
you get what you pay for?,"the earbuds sound great!  actually, better sound quality than my broken beats x that these have replaced.  anyway, the battery is not fantastic.  i get at most 2.5 hours of listening time from them before they require a recharge.  i notice that the more expensive brands have a much better battery life.  for the price i paid, i really cannot complain.  i would like to see battery improvements, but then, i guess i'll have to pay $200.00 to get it.  for less than fifty dollars, these'll do just fine.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Sounding, Comfortable, and Quality!","When I got this, I knew from the quality packaging I was going to like this item. It screams quality out of the box! I tried every ear bud to find the perfect fit and glad I did because the smallest size worked the best. The ear buds stayed in my ear no matter how much I deliberately moved to try and get them to fall out.
I opened the package at work and was the envy of all my coworkers as they commented how nice they were.
The sound was crisp, clear, perfectly bassy, and loud. Idk if they're noise canceling (not a selling point when I was shopping around) but when I was using them, I couldn't hear anything going on around me.
I love the charging case as it conveniently charges the ear buds and stores them when not in use.
I give this product a 5/5, can't go wrong with the 1 year warranty and great customer service!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Affordable yet Amazing!,"I bought this product a few months ago and I absolutely loved them! The sound quality is great, and they’re super convenient to use in public.
After a few months one of the earbuds stopped charging. I emailed customer service and they were extremely helpful and will be sending me a new charging box including earbuds for free.

Not For Me,"I got these to pair with our smart tv for late at night as to not bother neighbors (we live in a townhouse).

I even compared these with my studio beats and these are very good. The battery life is also amazing. I love the fact that if I run out of power with one I can pull out the other one from the case and charge the other one. These also feel like they are made with good quality materials. All I have to say is give this a chance, if you don't like it get your money back.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very disappointed,"I paid $50 for this product and was very excited to have it.  It arrived and I was disappointed because the earbuds kept falling out of my ears.  I contacted the company and they sent a smaller earpiece.  Unfortunately, that did not correct the problem.  They are useless because they do not stay in your ear when you walk or move.  Moreover, they are big and bulky.  This is definitely a do not buy, even at the reduced price of $29.  The worst purchase I ever made.  I am now looking for a good set that is usable for the gym or even on a plane.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Another brand that doesn't work well.,"I bought this product for my husband because I messed up with a cheaper brand that he likes better. Of course I read the reviews about the product...especially about the battery which is true. But, the quality of the sound and the breaking in and out wasn't mentioned. I might have a bad product or not...if I don't then others should agree. I heard other people voices when my huaband was talking to me. He had to charge the ear piece every two hours...when we talked he couldn't hear me..I forgot to mention that when I received a call I had to pick up my phone to use it instead of tap the right ear one time.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Does not work independently and has a long recharge.,"So I want to preface this with a statement saying that this company, Tozo, attempts to bribe people to leave good reviews, so keep that in mind with all those 5 star reviews. Now for my actual review. It sounds good, Takes way too long to get a full charge when a full charge only lasts like 2.5 to 3 hours. You know those old RC cars where you charge them as much as you can use them? Yeah that's what these reminded me of.  Waterproof seems to work fine though. They are comfortable in my ears at least.  Won't work without both being connected to each other and if one is on the charger they both disconnect. One will not work independently unless the other is in your pocket, which is not independent functionality, so dont listen to those questions that are answered that say they work independently.  The low battery warning is about 10 seconds before they die, and interrupts whatever you are listening to with s voice telling you.  Should just be a low beeping in the background, maybe on a future product?  Also, true independent functionality, with the water proofing and a full charge in about 15 to 20 minutes, I'd pay a little over 100 bucks for if you guys had it.  I tested these and the link between the two can be spotty, seems to be rare but it happens. One loses signal from the other and you hear the beeps as it tries to reconnect and then they work again. With that, I have maintained a connection between the two from about 50 ft away, more and they disconnect.  I do really enjoy the design, and their charge pad, nice quality charge pad and gorgeous but I'll go write that over there too.  The case has a very strong and satisfying snap as it closes that is nerd asmr.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I wish I could give it more stars,As a music lover. I need bass!!! And these fulfill my needs. Battery life is great and the music quality is great. I'd definitely recommend these headphones. The smallest ear buds fit me perfectly. I'm still trying to figure out how to adjust them so my braids don't knock the ear piece out of my ear. But the noise cancelation on these are life!!!!! I don't have to turn my volume all the way up on flights. Comes with a year warranty also,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really surpising...,"I was really surprised  by the sound of these headphones. The bass is much better than I thought and I think most people will be pleased. There may be a bit too much bass but that depends on how the ear buds are seated in your ear. I had some difficulty following the initial pairing instructions. They kept disconnecting  after about a minute so I needed to following the reset instructions and start new with the paring. Once I did this, they paired well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Choose something else.,"Decent sound, but crap battery life.  When they do successfully pair I always forget what combo I used. Almost like I did it on accident.

I am very pleased with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic value,"I bought these to replace a pair of Jaybirds that I accidentally put in the washing machine.  Going completely wireless is great, I love that there is no wire dangling between the earpieces under my chin or around the back of my head.  These earbuds paired easily with my phone on the first try.  If they seem to lack strong bass try a different size earpiece, I can hear a definite difference when I use the correct size.  The sound clarity is absolutely amazing.  The earbuds reduce ambient noise substantially at lower volumes even though they aren't marketed as such. Overall I am very pleased and would purchase them again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for the Gym!,"I made the switch from the basic wired Samsung headphones to the future with these Tozo Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds. After getting tangled up with my old wired headphones on the treadmill, I am happy to say the Tozo headphones perfectly fit my needs! These new earbuds fit securely, don't fall out even while jogging, and best of all are waterproof (for sweaty workouts). While these might not be as noise canceling as a set of $300+ Bose, for the price they are worth every penny!

When I purchased these I had no expectations and knew nothing about competitors like Apple AirPods and had no knowledge of Bluetooth headphones. I am so glad I made the jump and gave these a try! If given the chance I would purchase them again in a heartbeat.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Does not work under water,"Sure its waterproof. but what's the point if bluetooth doesn't work under water AT ALL... bluetooth doesn't transmit under as little as 2 inches of water, therefore making every swimming ad BS.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Shockingly Fantastic!,"1st.. pairing is infinitely simple. Just pick the buds out of the case, and they immediately turn on, pair with each other - if you're quick, you'll hear a clear voice indicating left, right pairing success - and when you pair to your device, it's just as simple. Be sure to look for 'Tozo T10 -R', because the Right bud is the master, and the left bud will slave from it. You'll never see the -L bud in your pairing lists.

Right now, I'm using them on my laptop for music.. my tablet + Roku app which allows me to listen to television privately thru the Tozo, and of course, my phone for calls + music.

The sound quality is.. well, I'm shocked at how good it is for a $50 pair of BT earbuds. Stereo separation is solid.. audio range is solid.. and these things actually have some bass punch! They won't replace your $200++ audiophile Sennheiser or favorite headsets, but the bang-for-buck is great!

Noise cancellation? I have to presume it works, because I've heard no interference or 'fuzziness' on calls or music. Just clarity of whatever source I'm listening to.

Waterproof/resistance? Can't speak to that, as I haven't had them near any such sources.

I have one.. and only one possible issue.. and to be fair, this may be the source devices causing it. On occasion, even when I'm right near the Bluetooth source (laptop or tablet in this case) I have had both earbuds slightly fade out for 1-2 seconds and then fade back in, with solid performance. This has seemed to happen randomly when I'm using laptop or tablet to listen to audio or TV. To be fair, this may be because the source device is processing other data. I haven't dug in to figure it out, yet. My tablet is a basic 1-gig Amazon Fire.. but my laptop is a high powered gaming rig and maxed out with ram.

This has not happened when I'm paired to my phone and using them on calls. They have been absolutely perfect on calls. No fades out or in.. just perfect clarity of audio.. and the microphones clearly work perfectly because I've never been told there was a problem hearing me, from the callers on the other end. They've said the call was very clear and easy to hear with little to no background interference.

Best activity wireless earbuds yet!,"These true wireless earbuds are so awesome. For the price you pay, I don’t feel like there is anything else as great as these. They are light and comfortable. I usually rock a medium silicone canal bud, but with these I went to the next size bigger so they really cancel out more of the sound, they are just as comfortable. I run, ride mountain bikes, road bikes, and my motorcycle and these are just great. When the call comes in I hear them and they hear me just fine. I recommend everyone to give these at least a try.

Lost connection,"The sound of this product is great. The buds are easily stored and I liked the feature of having the charging holder that easily fit into a bag for after the gym. My reasoning for sending these back was that even after trying different sizes of fittings for the buds, and following the turn and twist directions, the buds fell out of my ears on a consistent basis. I also found the disconnection from my phone to be annoying. It was almost every time that I turned my head that the buds would lose connection and then I would have to stop what I was doing to reconnect them. If it wasn’t for those two issues, I would have been satisfied with this product.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Satisfied,"Overall a really awesome product to buy if you're looking for a simple set of Bluetooth earbuds. The sound is amazing, it does a pretty good job of canceling outside noise. The one drawback that it has is that the battery life does drain pretty quickly while in use. Once it hits 20% percent it'll beep and let you know to charge it, thought it does that every few seconds until you start charging. Definitely worth the money, though!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"This product beeps, but is comfortable and has a long battery life.  Also good customer service.","This product cannot be used for what I want it for.  I like to use Wireless earbuds one at a time and this product... Ugh.  When you only have one connected it keeps searching for the other one so will beep repeatedly for several minutes!  And since I like to use this for sleep, this just cannot stand. The beeps keep me awake. What a useless quirk that makes this product essentially unusable.

Update: The company sent me a different product of theirs that is much more what I like without the beeping.  I'm impressed by their quick response and customer service so gave them additional stars.

Also, with these original headphones, I should add that I've used them when I was awake and about and they were very decent on battery life and much more comfortable than many others I've used.  If only not for the dang beeps, I'd prefer this one.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Unit replaced - replacement item is significantly better.,"I understand the physics behind this. The right earbud connects to the device, and the left earbud connects to the right. But Bluetooth uses 2.4 GHz, which does not transmit through water. What is my head made of? Mostly water. So turning my head, or moving, or really much of anything, causes the left bud to drop out. Constantly. Plenty of other manufacturers have figured this out, but not this one.

Audio sounds fine, build quality seems good, and I really like that the case is water resistant. But none of it matters when the left audio channel constantly cuts out.

EDIT: The company has graciously offered a replacement. I will update to three stars at the moment, because reaching out to dissatisfied customers is a solid customer service move. If the new ones work, I will happily update.

I'm rooting for these guys. I would love to see the replacements work.

UPDATE - The replacement worked significantly better. It still cuts out very occasionally, but it is completely usable. I also commend TOZO for reaching out to me, based only on a poor review, to ensure that I was satisfied. I was prepared to write the product off, but they went above and beyond to ensure that I was happy.

I heartily endorse TOZO. I wish every company was this thorough to ensure that the customer is satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Value and solid product.,"Update 2: one side doesn’t charge anymore. Also one thing I noticed with these earbuds... even when you turn it off, it turns on to charge depleting the charge left in the case. Dropping majo stars.

UPDATE: I was thoroughly happy that this earbud made it thru the 2 hr half marathon. I made sure it was fully charged and never tested it for this long. I got nervous at mile 12 when one side start to fade in and out. Not sure if it was the sweat or what but I notice that more often now even after a short run... for that losing a star.

I’m an avid runner. And been thru a whole host of headphones and was Leary of wireless “buds”. But I bought these as dual role of listening to music low profile at work (and for running).

So far nonissue with sweat considerably snug and Decent noise cancelling (in that I don’t hear much else besides music) and pretty decent battery life... so far.

Only issue? I gotten used to pairing one or both with my phone but it does take awhile to turnoff properly. Also, if u carry these in ur bag ur pocket in the car, careful because phone calls will be directed to your headphones.

Great headphones!,"These earbuds are amazing! I cant believe the quality you get for the price. They are very easy to use.

They last about 4hrs on one charge and I get roughly 4 charges out of the case. I have even used these in the shower without any issues. The case is easy to charge at the end of the day I just throw it on my wireless charger, no pluging in necessary. I would highly recommend if you are in the market for affordable wireless ear buds that offer the quality of some higher end brands.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Serious upgrade from the TOZO T8 line.,"I've owned a couple of Tozo's line of wireless earbuds, with the latest being the TOZO T8. What an improvement this T10 model is. Here's the list of improvements I remember.

1) waterproof - pretty important if I'm hanging at the beach or lake
2) wireless charging - I hated plugging in the little case and forgetting it. Its so simple to just put the product on a wireless charger.
3) additional ear sizes (used to come with only 3 sizes; now comes with 4)
4) better battery
5) you can close the case without it turning off the earpieces in your ear

The one thing I need to test is whether or not I can put foam caps on the ear pieces and still have this fit in its case. With that, this will hopefully be the last one of these things that I buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice Features,"These TOZO T10 Wireless earbuds are my first experience with wireless earbuds. The instructions are excellent and clear, but I did not (initially) read them closely enough. The first time I attempted to pair the buds the only TOZO product listed on my cell phone was T10L. I selected T10L and only the left earbud worked. I went back to the instructions and they clearly stated DON'T select T10L. Following the instructions (this time) I reset the buds. The second attempt to pair my cell phone offered the T10R selection. Selected T10R and both buds paired properly. They work well and stay in my ears. The noise cancelling feature could be a little better, but maybe I need to try a different sized cup.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid headphones. Recommended,Haven't had these long but so far they seem solid. Sound quality is good and loud.  They don't seem to cancel noise completley which is fine. They stay in my ear really well. I have been using them while riding my harley with straight pipes and i have expeienced no connectivity issues(other wireless headphones in the past would lose connection when riding. I assumed from vibrations). They even stay in place when i take my helmet off. The buttons on the headphones are not touch sensitive which for me is a plus. Pair the right ear. If you pair the left ear when you turn on the right one it will lose connection. So pairing the left one I assume is for single ear use... so just pair the right one so you can use both and if you only need one just leave the left one in the case... haha I feel like I made that longley overcomplicated. Anyway... this seems like a good bluetooth earbud set so far. If I have anything negative to say i will update this review,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprisingly Great,"For the price I wasn't expecting anything this nice. The bass could be better, but they have overall great sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life. They stay in just fine during workouts and are very comfortable.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding Customer Service,"After we purchased these ear buds, one fell in a parking lot and was crushed. I contacted Tozo and they responded immediately and replaced the set for us. I am very impressed and would highly recommend these ear buds and this company.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing quality and sound,"I purchased as a lightning deal. I was skeptical because of past attempts to purchase completely wireless bluetooth head phones. Past purchases from other manufactures proved to be poor quality and sound. I was very surprised by these ear buds. Fit is perfect. Device is somewhat larger than I though but the fit very well. Sound is amazing. pairing is super easy with iPhone 8 and iPhone XS. I love the fact that it charges in the case and the case is compatible with wireless charging. The only thing I wish was better is when using a single earbud (Right side) and leaving left in the case there is a small beep that happens every 30 seconds or so, But when using Bothe left and right together they are amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, long lasting charge, great value","Good sounding, love that the case keeps them charged and that they can be used independently or joined. This is great in situations where I need to hear the world around me, but equally great when I don’t! :-)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds great and comfortable fit,"I’m really pleased with these earbuds. They are well made and sound great. I was even surprised by the charging box and how the earbuds snap into their dock with magnets. Although they came fitted with silicone earcaps that were too big for my ears, they also come with other sizes so I was able to easily change them out. They feel snug and comfortable now. I also like that they are waterproof - I’ve worn them in the shower and can’t wait to wear them this summer in the pool.
I debated on putting 4 or 5 stars (would give a 4.5 if I could), and the that’s only because the charging box doesn’t seem to hold a charge as long as I would expect. The earbuds themselves last for most of the day of continuous play, but when they’re in the box they’re constantly charging and that drains the battery on the box. But in the big scheme of things that’s not a major problem, especially if you carry a backup battery around like I do for my phone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A+++++ love these so far!,I love these earbuds. They came with different size ear pieces which was a huge concern of mine. The smallest size fit my small ears perfectly. They were charged enough to use right out of the box to test them out. They linked to my samsung s8 right away and the sound quality is amazing. I will be purchasing a pair for my oldest and my husband. Oh and they arrived a day early.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's only 3hours of music,"Wow I've ordered and tried at least 5 pairs different brands even Bose, and let me tell you I'm very impressed with this earbuds, the sound is amazing specially the bass and the noise cancelation. The complaint I have is the comfort level, I think my ears are too small because they don't fit snug or I just don't know how to put them on. I'm using the smallest fitting and still no luck, I'll keep trying different angles maybe it's just me. But definitely recommend this.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very satisfied with my purchase,I use them while doing light exercise and they are perfect for what I need them for. The fit is snug enough that I can sprint or use my punching bag without them falling out due to repeated light impact. Sound quality is good and the charging case feels very sturdy.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can U hear me now,"I took a leap of faith & ordered these earbuds, I was super surprised!!! I was already using another brand, but my music sound in the gym or on my motorcycle was never loud enough to me...🙁
These TOZO earbuds are on point, they feel even more sturdy & the storage case is high quality material.

I highly recommend...👍😎👍",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price!,"Pros:
  1. I love these! They have good sound and they fit my ears nicely.
  2. When I work I keep one in my ear and rotate them when one battery gets low.

Cons:
  1. The design of these makes it critical that you speak up clearly when on a call.
  2. They can get knocked out of your ear during rigorous activity.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO for RTOZ the best combo option ever!,I was skeptical at first when I ordered it and happily surprised when I got it. Very nice package and presentation with excellent overall quality and great sound. Easy no hassle pairing. I also loved the quietness provided by the noise canceling during my first flight using it.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Headphones!,"I use head phones on a daily basis so I needed something that provided comfort, long battery life, and good sound. These head phones do just that. Great sound quality, and I love the fact that if I forget to charge them for a night they still have charge provide charge within the carrying case. They also have a great mic to them, when testing them the person on the call said it was super clear. Great head phones at a decent price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Top performer for waterproof earbuds, TOZO ranks very high in my book","Received the TOZO T10 as a gift for my birthday.  Right away I was excited to get them because I really enjoy spending time in the pool but not a fan of speakers.  One of the key features is the fit.  There are several sizes available and I selected a smaller piece that worked great.  Set up was easy too.  The Bluetooth connectivity was seamless and fast.  Once connected, the sound was perfect.  I use them for work as well with taking phone calls.  The sound quality for both me and the caller is very good.  I am sure you will enjoy.  Customer service responded quickly to an inquiry and was easy to work with.  Very helpful.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Mostly good with a few quirks,"I use these almost daily and for the most part they are good.  I listen primarily to audiobooks with occasional music and the quality is good enough for me.
My main complaint is the controls.  A tap of the button will toggle play/pause but there is no way to advance to the next track or adjust volume.  A click and hold of the button instead triggers a phone call to the last person I called which is not very useful for me.
Another small issue is sometimes when I return them to the charging case the right earbud doesn't seem to make contact and remains on and connected to my phone.  Re-seating it usually resolves the issue right away.  I've gotten in the habit of disabling Bluetooth on my phone when not needed but it would be better to not have to worry about this.

Overall I'm satisfied for the cost of these but wouldn't mind seeing a slight revision with better control options.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Value and Performance,"I've had these for about a month now -- so while I can't speak to longevity, I'm loving them so far. Compared to other wireless buds/phones I've owned they: 1.) pair much more easily and reliably -- just remove them from the case and they power up and find my iPhone; and 2.) have amazing sound quality.

I have small ears, so I had to use the smallest insert. I won't say they fit like a glove -- I think only a custom mold like pro musicians get would do that -- but they are reasonably comfortable and have only slipped out once, during a very vigorous workout. I've used them during normal workouts and bike rides with no slip-out issues.

I haven't tested how long they hold a charge, but I think they finally drained out on about my 4th use. The case charges them (and sucks them into place with cool, little magnets) and I only have to charge the case itself once every two weeks or so.

I don't know about you, but I just couldn't justify Apple's price for AirPods, nor of some of their competitors. My wife tried PowerBeats Pro's buds and hated them.

Again, we'll see if they're still kicking in a year (perhaps I'll update then), but for now, I'm very impressed and happy with these babies. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the jury being out on their durability. (But I did accidentally drop the case on my hardwood floor and they were fine, so there's that.)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wanted to like them,"I really wanted to like this product, unfortunately they would not fit in my ears. Honestly they hurt as well. Yes I tried each size of bud they gave. Overall I liked the look, and everything else about them. I feel you don’t deserve one star based on the fact they simply wouldn’t fit. Good customer service gave me my refund.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These ear buds work great,"Received the T10 earbuds on time  Everything worked right out of the box.  Set up was really easy.  The buds sync with each other as you take them out of their case.  Then connecting via bluetooth to my iphone was flawless.  Even connected to my pc - no problem.
They fit nicely in my ears and come with various size foam inserts as well
Sound quality is really good.
So far, so good.  I would recommend these to others!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Look, Feel, and Quality","The Tozo T10's are the perfect balance between quality and cost. The battery life on both the ear pieces and the charging case are both enough to last me a whole day of use. The noise cancelation is what surprised me the most, it is one of the best features. What I was most concerned about was the look and feel due to how bulky the ear pieces look online. In-person however, they barely protrude out of my ear so they are great if you don't want them to be noticeable. The sound quality is probably the best that I've even comparing to my previous pair of wired headphones. Overall I would recommend this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Relief,"I had a pair of very expensive Jabra's which had problems.  These Tozo's work very well.  It was a welcome relief after wrestling with the Jabra's for a couple of weeks.  You should know that you can't adjust the volume from the earpiece and you can't access your Google assistant or Alexa with them, but I can live without those things.  The tradeoff is saving over $100 and simple dependability.  OK, I've only had my Tozo's a couple of days, so I really don't know about long term dependability.  I'll be back if there's any problems.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent ear buds...,"This are great. The bass is good and the battery life is excellent! I would recommend these to anyone looking for a wireless ear buds..
The only thing that makes me feel bad,  is I payed the top price for mine about 2 weeks ago and now there $20 less! Ugh!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome ear buds if they fit well,"Have had them since August & they re slammig!  The sound is amazing, I can hear the tambourine in songs previously I'd only heard on my Nose system.The bass great but doesn't drown out other high & mid ranges which is important to  me for quality music playback.  They paid easily together automatically when taken from the case..Four top sizes included was 1 reason I kept them, I needed the extra small, still the buds are very noise cancelling, I have take them out of I see lips moving certainly won't hear them!
They arrived without flaws, packaged better than I could package a bift, btw they make a great gift considering price value & quality.. Wrist band of you're out. Silicone tips are an upgrade from rubber tips & more comfortable, imo
I chose the white & they look a bit more classy imo.
I have one question & one almost a deal breaker
Q: how to sanitize eartips & are there replacement tips of needed?
ADB: I most have small ears. They enclosed tips on insertion is genius
& much appreciated.  However they still stick out making my ears look like something growing out of them! Not a good look. Was going to ask If.mini buds available but death in family, vandalism of property, overstating guests got in the way.  I don't think everyone would have so h an awkward for & I've never been told my ears are too small for my face, Not even ENT's  That is my only complaint because they are awkward fitting in my ears if I bend my head downward 1 usually the right 1 is likely to fall out.
These have awesome sound, quality classy look compared to a friends set ...Great brand but as he said mine were better, if they only fit my ears a bit better & didn't stick out like Dumbo....oops not a good look.
Missed date to return of ask about the sanitation & tip replacements. Most of all a better fitting set of buds with same sound quality.
It's a love/hate thing Love the buds, hate the fit & fear of losing one if I'm moving around & isn't that the point of wireless buds, too be able to move & wear?  I should  contact the company about suggestions for a better fit same quality maybe they will read this review & contact me that would be nice.Oh I did email them about fit, They sent me an email with I copy of the already enclosed how to insert. Good info they included in my purchase. But nothing more. Fairness my month was extra busy as said.
Recommendation Great buds for what you get at a fair price, if they fit well you'll love them.  BTW they hold a charge good even when they fell out of my ear  I would never use them if I were really on the move due to ill fitting for me. For me I'll use them until I find a new  better fitting pair with the slamming sound noise cancelling these defiantly have. Like I said it's a love/hate thing
Any suggestions appreciated",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very nice set of ear buds,"First, let me start off by saying this: ""THESE ARE SOME VERY GOOD EAR BUDS"".

"Most Legit Headphones! Amazing price, Amazing product!","I went through three pairs of blue tooth headphones from FYE. I had to return every single pair due to connection problems, volume problems, and mic problems when on the phone.

These however are the BEST product I have purchased. I have not had problems with skipping of music, mic problems on the phone, or sound quality! The battery life is amazing and you can connect both or only connect one.

Only issue is you can’t sleep with them because it hurts, but other than that these are the most legit pair of earbuds I have gotten for this price. These are AmAzInG!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I’m still in awe,"I’ve been researching wireless earbuds for the past few years. I tried another brand a couple years ago and they were a huge disappointment. I understand why these are Amazon’s Choice and why they are at almost 5 stars with over 4,000 reviews. These earbuds are super comfortable, with different rubber ear pieces to make sure you have the perfect fit, but the sound is phenomenal. I have wireless Beats by Dre, and those are wonderful, but I wanted something much smaller, with comparable sound quality. These are it. And a fraction of the price.
I couldn’t recommend these enough to anyone looking for easy-to-use, yet great-looking wireless ear buds. The charging box they come with is an added bonus too, and so easy to carry around!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super price for superior quality,I’ve only had the earbuds for one day and they are amazing. Wore them the entire day in the office and no discomfort from wearing and then wore them at the gym.

"I am new to BT earbuds and from what I have experienced, these are excellent earbuds","I have never had any BT earbuds in the past. My son has a pair, but I did not want to spend the amount of money he spent. Especially, since I was not sure how much I would actually use them.  This price point was perfect for me and the reviews (even independent reviews) really indicated that they were worth the money.  So far, I have enjoyed the ability to utilize one earbud at a time while the other is left in the charging box. The box charges on my existing wireless charger I have had for my phone as well. I have made a couple phone calls through them and the quality was pretty good if I kept a steady volume to my voice. I will update my review as time goes by.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very happy with these...,I still want to dish out the cash for some AirPods in the future but these have been a great introduction into wireless headphones. The battery lasts long enough to not be annoying and their waterproof capabilities makes it easy to work out without anxiety of damaging them. If I had any issue it’s that they’re a little bulky and the blue light that occasionally flashes can be distracting but I don’t think that makes them worth any less considering the reasonable price tag.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Hoping to figure out the sound quality..,"So I just received my earbuds, followed the instructions for pairing, but I can't seem to get this great quality that everyone references. It's not my first pair of bluetooth headphones, so I know there is always a little bit of quality loss, but it's a pretty harsh quality drop.

Honestly I think I just forgot to return them because I have no idea why I would have kept them. The sound was decent as long as they were connected, but if you move your head the wrong way, the connection will be lost and during a workout because I would stop working out to try to fix this issue. This got to be so annoying that I just stopped using them altogether.

"Really great sound, deep bass, good noise isolation - a great value!","I have Apple Airpods, and they're convenient (I have all Apple gear), but the sound is thin and noise comes through. Not so with these - make sure to try the different tips to the earbuds to find the best fit, and then *boom* when you put them in, you will almost hear nothing other than your sound source. And the bass is very good and deep. Pairing is more difficult than AirPods of course, but it works fine once you get the hang of it. The range is pretty good. Love that they're waterproof, so it's OK to have them in when swimming (above the water).

"Amazing Sound Quality, But....","I want to start by reminding anyone reading this that wireless earbuds are still a baby technology, THEY WILL BE BUGGY. Even Apple's airpods are buggy. It's perfectly normal the first few years a new technology is released.

I have had these for a month now and am writing this review based on my daily use of the product.

This being said, I am a landscaper by trade and am moving around for 12+ hours a day. I needed something wireless as any wired earbuds get caught on my equipment annoyingly often. I bought these after learning they had a 10 hour play time, reading the good and bad reviews, and weighing my options. I got them first day and played them until they were dead (about an hour) and charged then overnight. To my dismay, they only charged halfway even though they were magnetically attached to their case all night. No chance they ""slipped off"" or weren't connected. I'm not sure if this is part of the glitches or if I have a defective charging case, but this seems to be a typical problem. I just make sure to wiggle the earbud so that it ""wakes up"" and continues charging. Unfortunately, they do not have a 10 hour play time. Once charged, they will play for about 3 hours before dieing. Luckily, none of my yards take longer than 3 hours to landscape and my drive time between properties can be an hour or more sometimes, so I just charge them in the truck.

Another hitch I have noticed, as other reviews have stated, the booth connectivity is weak between the right unit (main unit) and the left. This means that at least a handful of times throughout the day the left earbud blips in and out, interrupting the music. Now, if you are at a desk job or work with very little movement you may not notice this issue, but since I am constantly moving around, it happens with annoying frequency.

With all that being said, I love the sound these headphones have! The bass is amazing and they don't detract from the music quality. They also have a feature in both units that allow you to pause/play with a single push. They are also pretty good at phone calls. My husband and mom both say they don't notice anything. Unfortunately, there is no volume control on the unit, you have to use your connected device to control it.

In recap:

Pros: sound quality and bass, wireless, play/pause function, phone call quality good

Cons: glitchy connection, play time less than 3 hours, intermittent charging port, no sound control on unit

Would I recommend them ... No. This company still has quite a few bugs to sort out, especially the connectivity issue between earbuds. But they are good enough for me and work sufficiently for the price.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Right Ear - Completely Stopped working after one day of use.,"This manufacturer has manufacturer quality control issues. The headphones weren't dropped  and just stopped working with intermittent sound in right ear. Probably a cold solder joint. Will not buy this brand or products from this manufacturer again.

Best wireless earbuds,"Absolutely thrilled with this product, I never thought wireless earbuds would have the quality of sound, and the ease of use the these have.

"Fits perfectly, sound quality ok, low default volume - charge only lasts 2.75 hours","The GOOD - I am an avid mountain biker and runner, I am very impressed on how they stay in the ear, even after a couple of MTB crashes.  They do slip a bit in the ear, but a quick re-adjustment takes care of that - be sure to experiment with the different size buds.  Sound is better than expected.
The BAD - Not sure what Tozo advertises, but the charge only lasts 2.5~2.75 hours at 3/4 volume.  My phone is carried in my pocket so no drain on Bluetooth distance.
Also, compared to other Bluetooth headphones, the max volume does not reach what other headphones can get up to. I like to crank it for the gym but no go. I also had to lower the volume due to the short charge life - see above.

I would pass on these headphones if any of the issues are important to you.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good ear buds at a good price,"I have only had these for a few days, but here are my initial thoughts:
- pairing was easy and they automatically paired when I got to the gym
- I wanted a set that would stay in my ear while running and not slip out after sweating. I had no issues with this after one hard work out.
- sound quality was good
- once or twice the earbuds sound would fade in and out when I am exercising since my phone is on the move, slightly annoying but nothing drastic
- I have not tried all of the expensive pairs, but as long as these continue to perform no need to spend on the those
I will update if anything changes",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Excellent sound, easy to pair!","bought this for my wife, had to pick one out of the many products available at $50. this one had more reviews, and I now know why (*secret*). joke aside, I picked it since advertised as waterproof and with optional wireless charging feature.

about the product: very good sound, clear and deep. The pairing was exceptionally easy, each earbud configuring separately, but also detecting each other. smart ;-). in 30 sec the pairing was done.

about the size of the earbud: tricky. my wife found the size she wanted (2nd from the smallest). for me.. unsure. still debating. would not do free style in the water with it, would freak out!!

Last: have not tested the duration of the battery yet.. they say 3hours music/5hours phone, will see in practice and update this review. same for the 4 recharges per cradle.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Easy pairing indeed,"I always have a rough time with bluetooth - these things really do pair easily which is great. The fit I found to be great and don't think you'll have any issues at the gym.

Great bang-for-your-buck earbuds! What are you waiting for!?,"I'm really liking these earbuds so far! The bass is great and the range feels almost as good as some of my studio headphones. I recommend trying out all the earbuds sizes they provide. For $50 this felt like a solid deal compared to the other competing bluetooth headphones on Amazon. Battery life is meh but I use them for working out and at work so I can never need full charge off the charging station for more than a couple of hours. All in all, I high recommend trying with the warranty TOZO gives you.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love these earbuds!,I was reluctant to try wireless earbuds but I finally gave in. I am not one bit disappointed with these either. I had a little trouble pairing both buds at the same time and that was resolved in short order. The sound is incredible and they are super comfortable.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Design Flaw,"Left bud doesn't work by itself. Right bud beeps for about 5 minutes if you try to use it by itself. The beeping sound is completely unnecessary and really annoying. I'm going to be charged $7 for return shipping.

Too big for ears and annoying pairing issue,"So, I like these earbuds. Aside from having to go into settings and manually pair them for each use, they are pretty simple.
The reason I am scoring them so low is really because the silicone pads that come with them don’t fit my ears. That’s not necessarily  the company's fault, but they don’t sell smaller sizes. I’ll have to return them, which is disappointing. Without the pairing issue and the too big for my ears issue, I’d have given them five stars.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for price,"I've had my headphones for about a week now and they work pretty well. I'm still trying to figure out how to reduce the time it takes for just one ear to pair and I have received some complaints when I make phone calls with it, but it's great for listening to audio. I wish there was a way to increase or decrease the volume using the headphones, so that's something the developers could consider. All in all, I am a satisfied customer for the price I paid.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good for the price, Very good for the price if stationary","The set comes with plenty of size options for any ear, and even though they look bulky they are lite enough to not be noticed while wearing them. I will say they perform perfectly sitting at a desk or watching TV or playing video games. Every now and then they have connection issues when moving or putting the streaming device like my phone either hand to hand or in my pocket.

The manufacturer is very prompt with support and is sending me a free set to replace mine because of the connection issues.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good first impression but didn’t do it’s core function.,Well first impression in the Air was good. Connected right away and the sound quality was good. After wearing them for a few minutes they started to cut in and out. When I went to the water that’s where it got worse. I dunked my head in the waters and immediately lost connection. The regained connection after a few seconds. I decided to test them by swimming a lap. Again they lost connection but this time didn’t connect again. I was unable to repair them. Even after recarging them and forgetting the device reconnecting.  My phone saw them but were unable to connect. Sorry for the review. I know it’s a tough product to make. Not upset or anything.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome bass,They do feel a little big in the ear and the other thing that bothered me is that it announces everything like if I'm making a call or something. I'm not trying to be picky I actually do think the sound quality on this is great but I ctually like to defer to my other set of Bluetooth headphones because there magnetic and just lay around my neck when I'm not using them.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Truly good sound quality and noise canceling.,"I’m a Bose fan and was very skeptical in buying anything else, but these caught my attention. I’m so glad I took the chance because these are amazing.

"Quality sound for music, terrible for phone calls","The Tozo T10 wireless earbuds are an excellent budget earbuds. They have terrific sound and bass quality. The also come in a nice slim charging case that is sleek and easily fits in a pocket. The charge time is pretty good, I have about 4-5 hours in earbud time. They are said to be waterproof, but I have not had a chance to test that yet. On my runs they stay firmly in my ears and sweat doesn't make them move around. The one negative I am upset about is the call quality. I read other reviews on this product that the call quality is pretty good both for caller and receiver. I may have a defective pair but the receiver says I sound alien like. My voice is distorted. I tried this 5 times with different phones and people- same result. Since they are also budget earbuds you do not have as much touch control with the earbuds themselves. 1 click- play/ pause. 2 click- redial last number. I haven't seen anywhere I can change this.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Wireless Earbuds,I bought these because my AirPods broke so I was looking for something inexpensive and these had some really good reviews so I purchased them and tried them out and I was surprisingly amazed by the quality of these earbuds. I really love the sound quality and the I can feel the bass that what I was looking for. The pairing process to my phone was very easy. You pair the right earbud and the left automatically pairs itself. They don’t slip out of my ear a whole lot. I really enjoy these earbuds. I would recommend these to any and everybody!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So far so good,"These could seat better in my ears, but I’m sure they’ll fit everyone differently. Volume controls would be nice. When syncing with my TV via a USB Bluetooth dongle, I have no way of adjusting the volume. Otherwise, they could have a tad more bass. Keepers.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for an unknown brand namr,"I am a bit of a sound nut, having grown up in a family where music is paramount and a father who designed speakers and sound processors. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound that this product provides. I poured over previous reviews, paying attention to what was said about the sound quality and bass output. I finally decided to make the purchase and have yet to regret it. The quality is good, the bass is ok, but after downloading an equalizer app for my phone (as suggested by the company and other reviewers) the quality became sharper and the bass has a nice kick to it. I've enjoyed using these at the gym. They fit great in my ears as well, since I have smaller ear canals and have trouble keeping most buds in. These stay in whether I am running, talking, lifting, or just moving around in general. They have yet to hurt after prolonged wear too. Ive also been impressed with the case, as it charges the buds quickly and works with my Samsung wireless charging pads. Very happy with this purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very nice earbud for the cost,"I am an airpod user, but needed to find another option for wearing at the gym.  These TOZO T10's sound very nice, and work out well for gym use.

They have a nice wireless charger as well!  Nice job TOZO!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They're good when they do work,"Meh...I use these ear buds at work.  I only use one, my headset is on my other ear.  When they do work properly the sound quality is great!! However, when they work crappy...while using one bud it constantly beeps until the other one has left the charging dock.  Syncing them is difficult at times and the actual ear buds are uncomfortably big even using the smallest size.  Overall they get 2 stars from me.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The technology's just not there.,"I'm not sure if there's actually a quality pair of bluetooth earbuds out there, but the ones I have tried, including this brand, left much to be desired.  My two biggest issues were low volume and insufficient bass response. These might be okay for talking on the phone, but forget it when it comes to listening to music... that is if you really care about music.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Seem to  work well,"I received an email telling me if I gave a review they would send a free charger.  In the email I was told I needed to give 5 stars a few different times.  The earbuds have the potential to be 5 stars, but not just yet.  So far they are working great.  The button on the left ear is hard to push to turn on and connect.  If I don't have Bluetooth on when I turn them on, they don't connect immediately.  I have an iPhone 6+.  So when I have to turn off the earplug and turn it back on to connect, I have to push the button so hard that it actually deafens my hearing.  I wish the button would be a little more sensitive.  I'm hoping the on/off switch relaxes a little over time.  If so, the product is worth 5 stars.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Happy customer,I bought these for my husband and he loves them! First- they arrived on time; that's always a plus. He likes how the buds come in different sizes to fit his ear. No one like ear buds falling out while he runs. He can even share an ear bud with me and we still get the great sound quality. Overall- excellent wire free ear buds for a fair price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them!,"These earbuds have great sound quality, volume, and battery life! Apple airpods don't fit in my ears, and are quite pricey, so these affordable, comfortable, earbuds were a great alternative!

Indoor only,"These sound great.  I use them at night when people are sleeping connected to the TV or cellphone.  Words great indoors.  My TV is pretty far away from the couch and these work great.  I bought a total of 3 of these because they work well with kids on their devices indoors so I don't have to hear them.  Also the kids use them on car rides in the back seat for watching videos.  They work great.

Now outdoors and PC/Laptops is where they have problems.  I connect these to PC/Laptops and they crash the sound drivers.  I have some AT m50x Bluetooth and I can connect just fine with them on my PC/Laptop, so I think its just the TOZO's.  Also when I go outside for walking the dogs and running/jogging they seem to cut in and out like I am on a old CD walkman without antishock.  Its weird, but the only solution I found is keep it near the left side of your body, either being in the left hand or back left pocket.  Seems to work fine then.  Looking at getting a forearm strap for my phone so I can keep it closer without holding my phone.

The in-call noise cancellation sucks, people can barley hear me in calls and usually hear everything else better than my voice.

I would say, great for indoor use around the house, or for the people in the rear seat for road trips.  Especially for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Quality at a Fair Price,"As someone who typically can not wear ear buds/Airpods from Apple, i was pleasantly surprised to find this product.  They offer a ""customizable"" fit with the various sized rubber ear pieces.  It was easy to find an option that fit well, without falling out of my ears or causing discomfort.  The sound is awesome for the price, and the snug fit really helps keep out outside noises.  They paired immediately to my iPhone, and i was able to use them right away after their initial charge.  Would highly recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound quality w/ fit kinks,the audio/sound is way better than I expected. Possibly better than or equal to my airpods. The only thing that is taking some adjusting is how they fit/lay in my ear when I use them. I'm still trying to work out the size/fit of the headphones,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth the money!,"There are some main issues:
1.  sometimes randomly, left and write earbods do not pair resulting in one paring with your phone, then you have to reset them both to get both working! sucks!
2. Sounds keep changing channels, transferring from left to write, dropping or increasing volume, bluetooth connection to the phone is also pretty weak which make the sound break up and change quality,
3. Overall, don't waste your money!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Bass is great!,"Sound quality is very good, outstanding bass for earbuds.
Battery life has been very good for me, and the charging case charges them very quickly as well as it charging quickly as well.

Comes with 4 different size ear pieces, first few didn’t fit me well but found ones that do.

Noise cancellation is on point, to the extent of almost being annoying because how good it is (hard to socialize with both in)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice earbuds for running,"I bought these wireless earbuds mostly for running outside and exercising in gym. My previous lightweight wireless headphones didn't provide good sound quality. Any my other noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones while providing good sound weren't suitable for running because they were soaking in all the sweat.

I completely satisfied with the sound quality of my new TOZO earbuds. They don't provide complete isolation, which is good when you're running outside. As long as I found right size of cushions they sit comfortably tight in my ears. I didn't have any pairing issues. I didn't use them very long periods yet to check the battery life. But they definitely charge quickly and conveniently using their charging case.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Ok, but overall not worth $50","This item is... ok. If you’re looking for something to work out in, not for you. The way that it’s designed makes the back too heavy and in the end it just falls out when ever you move up and down (I.e. running, yoga, swimming, not gonna work out). The sound is decent, it’s loud and over all pretty average, an ok amount of bass behind it as well, but the left bud is quieter than the right. The connection is pretty bad. Sometimes I’ll just be sitting and I’ll rest my hand on my head and the sound will cut out in the left ear bud. Also, it only sometimes automatically connects to your phone, and while the right headphone is supposed to be the “master” bud, the left one will attempt to lead as well and then neither of them work with the phone, just causing more steps. I think that there are better products for the price, it was my first wireless earbud purchase, and I think it’s ok for my first run, but not a great item.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Problems starts arising but sound quality is great. I’ll still give it another try.,"Base is great! Pretty clear. Similar to a Bose quality sound. Only problem is no matter how I charge it as soon as I take it out it keeps beeping like it’s low in battery when I’m on the phone every few seconds. After a few days it keeps connecting and disconnecting while on the phone. When it comes to important calls it gets really annoying because you won’t hear what the other person is saying. I haven’t read the manual to pin point the problem but in a few days if it gets even worst I’ll return it. Maybe it’s just a faulty one. I’ll still give it another try because the sound quality is pretty darn good!

(UPDATE) ok so this is quality review: had it for a few weeks now. After 2 days it started having problems. Kept beeping like it’s low in battery but I’ve left it charging for 2 days! A few days after it started cutting in and out. Disconnecting and connecting randomly. At the beginning or a few times in the conversation. Gets annoying and especially for important calls you won’t hear what they’re saying. I thought it’ll get better in time but it seems to be getting worst. So sad. Sound quality is great but sadly it’s not working properly so I’ll have to return it. I rate it a 1 Star after this experience. If you can’t use it sound quality doesn’t matter.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Goid product for the price.,"I had purchased these buds because I was in a pinch. Being a maintenance man for properties I deal with plumbing and that includes water... well, my phone took a bath. This left my microphone inoperable. Instead of replacing my phone that works fine other than the microphone I rely on bluetooth. I had a nice LG JBL set but being over 6 years old they quit... So, I purchased these. Not as expensive and do the job. These new style buds are iffy for the fact they are just that buds. No cables, nothing to restrain them from getting lost. You rely on the product and your ears to hold them in. Sound quality is good for what they are. You may want to download a sound equalizer app if your looking to get better quality. For me, they work good without. Microphone wise, I have had no issues. Unless, if your like my sister and relies on her car audio for calls, good luck. She said I sounded really quiet during our conversation. Nothing that can really be done about that. Noise cancellation, still can hear the environment around you just muffled. It all depends on your preference really. I do like the waterproof aspect. Being that I do work outside quite frequently it's a nice feature. They also come with a one year warranty.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Small but POWERFUL,I’ve been looking for wireless earbuds for a while now and I took a gamble at these. Best decision I’ve made. Great sound quality and they really pack a punch.

They are actually pretty damn waterproof!,"I left my Airpods in Houston after a business trip; which was a good thing because the sound quality was poor and they had zero noise cancelling capabilities. I bought the Tozo 10's on a whim to replace them, and could not be more satisfied for the price. They fit well and don't fall out. The bass and sound quality is satisfactory, and they look about as good as you could ask for. The most surprising thing I found is that they really are waterproof. I work out in the pool a lot, and I gave them the full test in the pool yesterday. Water was splashing on them and it didn't effect them at all. The ear buds keep almost all of the water out of your ear, so the sound never really gets distorted. I even wore them beneath the water, and they still held true. However, the sound cuts out when you go under water because the Bluetooth signal cannot traverse a liquid environment. Whenever I surfaced, the music would go right back to playing. The signal distance is satisfactory as well. For example, I wrapped my phone up in a towel and put it in the center of my 25 meter long lane, and I received minimal cut outs in sound. Would, and already have, recommend this to anyone trying to get decent/good quality wireless headphones.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The ability to charge wirelessly.,"The sound quality is great for this product. The price is great for a product of this quality.

Stopped playing audio!,"I used the product every day, multiple hours per day. They stopped playing audio through my phone after about a month and a half. At first I liked them due to the sound quality and noise cancellation. I work with metal so it's hard to find headphones that do both for an affordable price. These were great until they broke. Headphones should last longer than a month and a half in my opinion",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They don't work well,"They take wayyyyy too long to auto-connect to my phone. I mean it takes at least 3 minutes! Additionally, the left earbud often intermittently disconnects from the right so the sound in your ear is in and out which is frustrating. I noticed it when I had alerts coming in and ok, fine. But the sound is also interrupted for no discernible reason. Also, it often happens that the left earbud will play music at a different speed than the right earbud. it often plays the music at a faster speed. That is super disorienting.  They fit my ear well and the sound is good, but i can't use them! Don't waste your money. Another pair I bought had similar issues. Maybe the tech isn't good enough yet? Maybe these are too cheap?

Excellent audio w/superb bass.  Inductive charging feature is great.,"I received the Tozo T10  Bluetooth 5.0 wireless earbuds earlier today.  These are the best earbuds that I have owned.  I charged the carrying case with my wireless inductive charger and then paired the earbuds without any issues.  The audio quality is very crisp, the bass is very deep, and the volume can be set noticeably higher than my previous earbuds.

The carrying case is somewhat large for my jean pocket.  But, the carrying case comes with a neck strap so this works fine.

The phone call connectivity is good.  My previous earbuds which also supported Bluetooth 5.0 had some connectivity issues.  These earbuds do not have these issues.

Overall, the earbuds are an excellent value.  The IPX8 waterproof feature for both the earbuds and the case is a great bonus feature.  I might start to wear these while swimming.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Really well built wireless earbuds, but poor sound quality.","For the price, I don't think there's anyone that can beat it.  The battery life will probably give you 120 minutes before you have to charge it.  As for noise cancellation, it's no active noise cancellation, but the earbuds do block off 85% of the noise.  Sound quality is by far the worst...maybe because it's waterproof, the audio sounds muffled.

While they don’t fall out because the seal on these are great! I had mine for only about 4 days before there was some kind of digital short in my left one.

Hopefully I just revived a defective product but the sound quality is about equal to a 7$ pair of Walmart earbuds. Everything else is great, comfortable, good battery life, relatively inexpensive, but when you pay 50$ for earbuds you expect to get decent sound quality, the other features don't matter at all if the sound isn't up to par.

Not for swimming,"I had high hopes for these earbuds for swimming laps. They are advertised as waterproof and good for swimming.

Some reviews even said they were good for swimming, which kind of baffles me. Anyhow. Sound was fine and they seemed decent, just not for doing what I bought them for. Will be returning.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Exceeded expectations in sound quality, noise cancelling, and form fitting. Totally worth the buy!","These head phones are excellent! I am extremely happy with my purchase and hope to have these for quite awhile. The only thing I’ve noticed, which is extremely specific, is that if you already have them connected to the phone, and go to place them in the case with the case being almost out of charge, then connect your phone to a different Bluetooth device (for me that is an fm transmitter), once the case battery dies the headphones will act as if they have been pulled out of the case and connect to the phone again, forcing me to reselect the other device. But seeing as that is so specific, it has no negative bearing on my view of this product. The sound quality is excellent for the price(not “true flat” but nice), I’m a music recording tech, so I know good sound quality.
The noise cancelling works perfectly. And even though I was worried that these would have problems staying in my ear, I was proven wrong and am not even the least bit concerned about them falling out unless I’m head banging to some death metal!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I will have my phone just a foot away and the sound cuts in and out as if I were walking to another room and leaving my phone behind. I have trouble shot the bluetooth and even changed from an Galaxy S8 plus to a Note 10 plus and it didnt help at all. So now I am disappointed that I wasted my money on them.

"Dynamic Sound Earbuds, Comfortable Fit with Storage Case as Charger. Very Sleek.","These are the most versatile earbuds I've owned. Very practical that the case is a charger. I have lost two wired headphones and one wired Bluetooth headphones because the wire snagged and fell. These fit comfortably with the choice of 4 earbud sizes. The charge lasts for over an hour and half at minimum and it has great noise reduction. The sound quality is very good and can be loud without distortion when the volume is full. The Bluetooth range is fine for biking whether my phone is in my pocket or fitted on the handlebars. I have not tested that it is waterproof, but riding in the rain has not been an issue. They are comfortable and sleek. I am very satisfied with these earbuds that were at half the cost of my Klipsch wired headphones or my ISOtunes Bluetooth headphones.

I did drop one in the bath and still works fine so can say it is waterproof, only thing I cant say is I havnt tried making phone calls while using them so not sure how good they work for that. Would definitely recommend these for a cheap alternative with great sound, and waterproof..I just ordered the white set for my wife!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality and noise cancelling earbuds,"The first thing you notice about these earbuds is the high quality construction. The instructions are straight forward and easy to follow. Had the earbuds paired with the iPhone very quickly. There were ample options for ear plug sizes to make them fit comfortably and securely, even with jumping around they didn't dislodge. The sound quality is great, but the best part is the noise cancellation which got rid of outside noises.

The holder/charger has nice magnetic contacts to take the earbuds which is great. The earbuds charged up to full capacity quickly and for their intended use (used while running), the battery life has been perfectly fine.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Just what I needed.,"This is the first time I am using wireless Airbuds of any sort so I read alot of reviews on many different brands and I chose this. Firstly I chose this because I was satisfied with the reviews that I have read. Although i have never heard of the brand it did sound quite impressive to me. Also, being on a budget I wanted to get something valuable for my money. I only started using these about a week now and i must say, i was worried about if they would hurt my ear, to be honest I barely feel them, I even fell asleep with them once or twice because they feel so non-existent in my ear. They come with different sizes of the actual 'earplug' so you have to try which one is suitable for your ear.  The sound is wonderful, it's very detailed, you hear every instrument crystal clear through these babies. I have used earphones in the past and because of background noise the person you're speaking to automatically know that you're connected to a device, but with these,  the person on the other end does not hear that background interference AT ALL.  The noise cancellation is great, kinda scary, makes you feel like only you in the world matters. It's a great product. I cannot wait to use it at the gym.  I have not used it in water as yet to give a review of that but I was in a little rain and that has not affected the functions at all. I will greatly recommend this to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great choice for the smaller earbud,"Nice product overall. I purchased these because I thought I had lost a pair made by Taotronics. I got this pair because of the amazon recommendation. They work well enough and make music listening while I work enjoyable.
Compared to the TaoTronics  these are actually not as good and a bit more expensive. Thats not to say they are bad just not as good. Sound quality lacks a bit and the carry case is a bit more intrusive when pocket carried. Still a good buy if you need smaller.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Cost effective Earbuds,"Based on what I paid for, these Earbuds are great. They have a great sound quality. They pair easily without problems. Just follow the order from taking them out of the case, first left and then right. Also pair the cellphone only with ""R"" Earbud. I was facing some dropping on the left, but I just followed the instructions where it says that once the earbud is inside the ear, just rotate it. That I guess helped to mitigate the interference made by the head. Also the place where I was testing this guys was an office full of other Bluetooth devices. But now I don't face any issue at all. The only thing that I would improve from them is that if you leave them in the case, the battery will keep draining. Also, their tech support is good, they do respond to any email.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"First wireless earbuds, loving them!","Recently got these earbuds and am really enjoying them so far. Very comfortable in my ears, excellent sound quality and the bass is solid! Much better than my last pair. The charging case is great, and very convenient. It's nice to have the buds clean, always fully charged and to have the ability to recharge without plugging them in to an outlet. I was also very impressed with the Bluetooth call quality. Friends I have called with the buds all commented that they could hear me perfectly and I could hear them perfectly as well!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Superb quality for the price,"My review of products typically consist of a single word: bad, good, OK, satisfactory, great, etc.  For the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds a single word is not sufficient.  A group of friends and I travel on our motorcycles.  The Honda Goldwing has on board sound but when wearing a helmet I have to use a wired set up.  The wired sound is OK until getting or turning off the bike. When the bike is off so is the sound. The T10’s make it possible to Bluetooth through my iPhone, wear the earbuds with my helmet on or off and exit the bike with no interruption of music/sound.  The T10’s sound quality is crisp and clean unlike other earbuds I’ve tried.  The pairing is SUPER easy, they fit securely in my ears, the sound quality is exceptional, comes with a charging case and all for less than $50. I am exceptionally happy and pleased with this purchase!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Sound is good, call quality is good, warranty seems legit so far","Good sound , also seems to have better call quality than some of the reviews say,  this may be because people aren’t rotating the earbuds towards the back.  They fit well in my ear and aren’t as loose as previous pairs.  Especially when rotated back to fit snugly in the ear.  Haven’t had them long enough to say with certainty that they stay paired or have any battery life issues.  The warranty seems more legit than the last earbuds I bought.

So far so good so I’m very happy with music sound quality and call quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud constantly cuts out,"The sound quality is not bad for the price. But like most people who are using these, I am having an issue with the left ear bud cutting in and out. They seem to work fine when my phone is on the treadmill in the open. As soon as I put my phone in my pocket to go lift, the audio cuts in and out from the left side. Any minimal movement can trigger it. The technology in these does not seem great, which is unfortunate because the quality of the case and product seems very good.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I cant even feel them in my ears. Super lightweight.,I love these earbuds. The quality is really great. I use them at work alllllll day long and only need to charge them once. They last about 3-4 hours on one charge. The sound is really good and crisp. They are super lightweight and i can't even feel them in my ears sometimes. They stay in my ears snug too. I talk on the phone with them too and can hear clearly and the other person hears me good too. I'm very happy with these and they go everywhere with me even the gym.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Finally I've got the right ones BABY!!!,I am extremely impressed with these earbuds I have gone through at least four pair for different companies this year and they have just not been the greatest quality the charge doesn't last or they don't stay in my ears and these are doing an awesome job it's only been 24 hours but I desperately needed some good earbuds these are great quality great reasonable price I absolutely recommend anyone to get these,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Customer Service,"Edit: So the company reached out to me and sent new pair which appear to work great. I suspect I may have initially gotten a defective product, but the new item sent works wonderfully. Would recommend!

So I brought this primarily for listening to Audible, and in that capacity it works well. However (and I'm not sure if this is a defect or an intentional design) when listening to music it becomes clear that the left earbud seems to have practically no bass at all.

This wasn't as apparent when listening to a person talk (phone calls or Audible) as the sound is clear, but it is noticeably lacking in bass on one side.

As such, while the product works well enough, I'm not likely to recommend it with this flaw.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and convenience of wireless charging at competitive pricing,"So many other bluetooth earbuds at the similar price range as the Tozo but have been pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and the convenience of the wireless charging case.  The internal packaing could be better since the ear buds aren't individually wrapped or the charging contacts covered in tape like others, and the touch control panel could be finished better (can see fine scratches), which I initially thought was used, but a replacement unit all exhibited the same condition.  Get it when it's on sale and it's a good buy.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They provide rich sound but won’t stay in my ears.,"I find the sound quality good but for the life of me these earbuds will not stay in my ear. I have tried all the end covers (or whatever they are called) that came with the earbuds but none of them work for me. I now dampen the buds when inserting them in my ear to create some suction and that works but it is not ideal and has to be done each and every time I have to put them back in. I can’t help but think I am inviting an ear infection.

I wish the charge lasted longer than roughly 4 hours. The average length of a workday would have been ideal.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
WELL worth the price...,"I've only had these for a few days, but REALLY, REALLY impressed. Ease of pairing, ease of functionality, excellent batter life. If these continue to perform at this level over the next few months, will buy more for family members as gifts this year. Very happy with this purchase and value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Work great , battery life is excellent","love these , I mostly use one to discreetly watch Net flix at work (SHHHH) , so if you use one you have to use the right one. sound is good not great but for the price I am very satisfied. you cant go to far from the source but its not terrible. I would recommend them to anyone unless you are looking for insane quality but you will pay double or triple.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's OK,"It's ... OKAY. If you turn your head a little bit, sometimes the left ear would stop working for a second. Really annoying when listening to music, so you'd have to reset the earbuds. Sound quality is actually pretty good for the price as well.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Holy s&@t!!!,"First off I have to say I own a pair of Bose earbuds that I paid $300 for. That being said I WISH i would have found these first. Now I’m only gonna talk about the sound quality considering I’ve owned them for about 2 hours. First off when I first turned them on I was blown away, volume only half way up and was loud (good loud), so going loud enough is not a worry. Next I tried about 10 different kinds of songs and all sounded amazing! Crisp clear highs, bass was great and mids were on point. That being said, if I would have paid $100 I’d still be overly joyed! If you buy these you won’t be disappointed.... p.s ANYONE that are having battery issues got a defective pair (which happens with electronics, believe me I fix them for a living). They should return them for a different set, cause mine are absolutely amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Connectivity and range issues, doesn't stay in ear.","First and foremost, the sound quality on these is decent, having said that everything else is below par.
I had these for about a month before I decided to return them.
The issues started with connectivity, the range on these is very poor, and I mean if you walked away from your phone more than a few feet, the sound would start cutting out and breaking up.
Second and biggest issue for me is the fact that if you run with these on, they will NOT stay in your ear. I tried the smallest to larger eartips and they would always fall out.

Call quality is very poor, I had people on the other line not being able to hear me at all with these on.
Overall the price for what you get is not that bad, but in this case it might be worth it to pay a little more to  get  better quality.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Buds,"First pair of wireless buds I've owned and I don't think there's much you can improve on. There's great sound quality, portability, and with the charging case, enough charge to listen to hours and hours of music. They come with small, medium, and large interchangeable rubber buds so you can wear them comfortably, a charger cord, and a lanyard, as for the battery life, 3 hours for the buds, and 4 full charges on the case. If that's not enough, they are also waterproof ( non submergable )",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Got an used product...Defective!,"Before I place my order, I searched on Amazon, and found out this product has decent review and ""amazon choice"". I have to say, the shipping service is great. I got the package and tried to enjoy the music. I tried to pair these earbuds with my music player, then I heard ""second device connected"". That means, these earbuds was connected with some devices before and the volume are super loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Be careful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Don't buy this product if you want to protect your ears.  It's ridiculous that the default volume is so loud!!!  Also, the left and right earbuds lost connection occasionally. Have to return it and get my money back.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bargain!,Volume control is on the phone only.  Not a perfect fit but the sound is unexpected for its price.  I little clunky.  I tried sleeping (nap) with them on.  It’s fine until I turned over to my side.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best value wireless buds,"Sound = perfect, no serious...rich flowing sound quality, super impressed
Battery life =  awesome, lasts a long time between charges
Size/ease of use = ideal, fit is great, all-day comfort too
customer service = awesome, gave me a full refund and covered return shipping

My first set had a crackling sound and would disconnect if right earbud was over 4ft away or didn't have direct line of sight to phone. So, I returned them. Tozo did some kind of magic fix, because the replacements are absolutely great. They paired easily and work every bit as good as the Samsung earbuds that came with my new Galaxy S10.

Tozo went out above and beyond to make sure I was happy with their product. They contacted me after the return asking me to test out the new version to see if the problem was fixed. That is amazing, right? I think this company has the mindset that many manufacturers today have forgotten. I'm very impressed with their customer service and their product and would not hesitate to recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Professional,I had issues with the first ear buds and got an immediate response from TOZO.  They were very accommodating and replaced the ear buds.  New TOZO T10 seem to be working fine.  I am very pleased.  They deserve a 5 Star.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent budget earbuds,"The Tozo T10 earbuds have great battery life, I can use them all day on and off and still have 25 - 50% left on the wireless charger case. The wireless charging works great, but when it isn't perfectly aligned, I have noticed a strange high-pitched whine coming from it. Also the fit took some getting used to, but now that I have it down, they stay in pretty well. I don't find them to be super comfortable, but I'm still getting used to them. The sound quality is ok except the volume is realitively loud with no way to turn it down from the earbuds even with low volume from the phone. The microphone is okay, but it's a bit too quiet, and I couldn't get it to work with Windows 10. It works with Android though.  I'm pretty satisfied with these for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Positive Reviews are Real - These are Great,"Wow - color me impressed. I was not expecting sound quality this good, and bass this powerful, out of a generic pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I read the reviews though, and they seemed legit - trust me, they are. I was thinking this was going to be another piece of generic Chinese technology with some random brand name slapped on it - with a package insert promising free products or an Amazon credit in exchange for a good review (I've received products like that in the past). Thankfully, this is NOT one of those products. There is no incentive to leave a good review, so the good reviews are actually genuine.

The only thing that was slightly disappointing at first was the quality of the bass - but that was quickly remedied (as others recommended) by swapping out the silicone caps on the earbuds with another size from the included sets, to get a better seal in your ear. It went from tinny to almost too powerful - I had to jack the equalizer on my phone back down to the normal range so my fillings weren't rattling. Now, with the proper-sized silicone caps, it sounds great.

Finally, they feel extremely secure in my ears. I bought these for running, replacing a pair of wireless earbuds that had a rigid plastic wire that connected the left and right - when I would run, the piece that wrapped around the back of my head would flop and hit the back of my neck, resulting in a deafening thump with every step. My only concern was that these would pop out during activity, but they actually feel far more secure in my ears than my regular wired earbuds.

These are definitely going to be my full-time earbuds, not just for running - these awesome little things are going to accompany me on my daily commute as well. VERY happy with this purchase.

*****Follow-Up******
In the interest of full-disclosure, after I submitted this original review I went and registered by earbuds for the warranty, after which I was contacted by the manufacturer/seller who asked that I review their product and in return they would send out a token of their appreciation. I submitted the review above though before this happened, and I believe I was only hit up to do so because I registered and provided them with my email address.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Low expectations happily surpassed in every way,"I'm only one week into owning this product, so I can't give any insight into how the long the battery lasts or the long term durability of the product. Although, I can give my first impressions on the sound quality, noise cancellation, fit, and overall experience I've had with the product so far. I came from using Bose Soundsport wired headphones and I went through 2 pairs in about 4-5 years. I was initially worried about sound quality coming from a wired 100$ pair of headphones to a completely wireless 50$ pair. Right away I was kind of blown away by the sound quality on these headphones. My expectations weren't super high, but sound quality is really important to me and these definitely surpassed my expectations. It has a nice bass sound when sitting properly in your ear, and they are really loud and fairly clear.  Fit can make or break the experience. It felt great with the rubber tips that came on the product and the smaller set that it came with it. Both worked well with my ears and it's nice to have 4 options to get the size just right. I wasn't expecting any noise cancellation, but these have a great seal and I felt immersed in my music. I think noise cancellation can be affected by the fit and how it sits in your ear. Fit is king with this product. If none of the 4 sets of rubber tips fit properly it's hard to get the most out of this product.
My overall experience with the product has overwhelmingly been positive. Paired immediately with no fussing around, sound quality is great for the price, comfortable, immersive, and I love the travel charging case. I only have a few worries and concerns for the long term. But overall, I'm definitely happy with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not for swimming!,"I wanted a pair of waterproof ear buds for swimming laps. Even the one page brochure appears to advertise it as a good way to swim and listen to music. This is not true. The minute they are even slightly submerged the signal is lost. If you swim with your head constantly above water then these can be used for “swimming.” Any competitive swimmer will be disappointed.

I wanted to leave only one star but I do admit they did a good job ensuring that they pair easily and the sound quality is fairly decent.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality and sound for a great price!,"These earbuds are amazing. My boss recommended these and I have zero regrets. First off, they say 3 hours per charge.

Buy them!,"I had bought a pair of Jabra earbuds from my local big-box electronic retailer, which basically stopped functioning after about 6 weeks. These earbuds cost about 1/3 of the price, and have worked flawlessly from day one.

They paired to my iPhone very easily, and have excellent sound. I use them while I'm doing my daily 6-mile walk, which takes about 1.5 hours. They block out most of the ambient sound, yet do allow me to hear things like cars that are approaching from behind with no problems.

Very pleased with them. Excellent quality and excellent value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Initially Skeptical Pleasantly Surprised!,I was in the market for new BT headphones to wear while traveling and working in my shop.  I had typically used the around the neck style because most end up hurting my ears pretty quickly.  I wanted buds but doubtful I would like them.  I decided to give these a try and have been pleasantly surprised.  I've only had them a few days and had limited use but so far they are comfortable and feel secure.

I went as far as to show them to my wife and suggest she get a pair....LOL,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent sound quality, Fast charging","While the case is too small to be charged with the Samsung galaxy S10 power share feature, the battery holds plenty of power for what I need, and the charging case means I can charge it on my breaks and have it almost full again in just a few minutes.

Early Impressions,"My experience with the TOZO T10's so far has been a pretty good one, they are easy to set up, sound fairly good for bluetooth earbuds, and losing the wire makes it easy to sleep with them on and not have one of them get pulled out of my ear when I turn. They are extremely comfortable which makes me want to use them for any devices while lounging but there are some limitations as they don't have a built in volume up or down controls. Due to that, I wouldn't recommend using them with a Fire TV for example as that goes off the headphones audio levels and can't be adjusted. Other than that though no issues with anything. They charge really fast, feel durable, they came with different ear type pieces but the stock ones perfect for me, and have an IPX8 rating. (I haven't had the luxury to take them on an intense run yet but will update if anything goes wrong. though my cheaper IPX7 pair is lasting those so I'm not worried for these things.)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Not the best purchase,"I purchased these and maybe I expected more than what I got.  Most of the time they don't pair the way they should, and the rest of the time they don't connect well to my phone.  Pretty disappointed in the product because I was hoping to use them to work out.  However, if you move the phone to your pocket or something you can forget about using them.  Even if the phone is in sight of the earbuds sometimes they cut in and out.  Other than that, they come in a convenient case and charging is pretty easy.  The battery life on them is also questionable.  I used them for about 2 or 3 hours and they died.  Not sure if I got a defective pair or if they just suck, but I would recommend spending more money on a better product at this point!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's not waterproof and the Bluetooth does not support even shorts distance like 4ft,"Not waterproof at all. Got a little bit wet with some sprinkles of water and does not work anymore.
If you are using to workout every time you turn down to do something or grab something in the floor it interrupts the sound like cutting off.
Bluetooth is not 5.0 at all. In the distance between my room and my kitchen which surely it's very less than 4ft in a small apartment, it does not work ad well it cut off the sound and interrupt what you are listening.
I can say if something is waterproof like my galaxy S10, the S8 and 9 as well which you could win until 5ft and it would work perfectly. This phone is like the iPhone, just try to sprinkle some water and you will see if works or not.

Absolutely best ear buds for the price,The quality of these ear buds are absolutely insane. I had been looking for a good pair of ear buds to go to the gym with and for everyday use and these absolutely beat air pods in the price and quality.

I got them for watching videos while treadmilling it and they have not fallen out yet. Sound quality is good, but my usage is to work and exercise in them, not sip brandy in a leather chair and try to decipher every note. The battery life is good, I haven't run out yet. I will update if they end up being trash.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
There are better options at this price.,"TL;DR - Do not recommend buying unless the only thing you care about is waterproof, loud bass.

Bought two pairs of these. Returned one thinking it was faulty. All Pros and Cons below are based on both sets so you can pretty much expect the same.

Pros:

Bass. If you love it, you will like these. Very strong profile compared to other sets. Likely due to the 8mm driver, most others are 6mm or smaller.

Loud. Much louder than comparable sets. Rarely need to hit the volume limit. Consider if you need the extra volume headspace.

Waterproof. You can submerge these in shallow water with no ill effects. Swimming, showering, etc are no problem.

Connection. When dropping out of range, the left disconnects temporarily while the right usually stays connected. Reacquires very quickly.

Cons:

Sound. Noticeable distortion at mid-high frequencies on left earbud only. If you own these, don't listen to Thievery Co- Sweet Tides, you will never unhear it. Stereo sound oscillates back and forth from left to right earbud through center-stage while listening to music or on calls instead of staying at the same volume level.

Drops. Loses connection at random times. Complete drop outs only correctable by turning off and on again or putting back into case. If you take critical phone calls, you can't depend on these.

Call quality. Sub par compared to others. Voice transmitted sounds very distant. Voice transmitted cuts in and out constantly.

Case. Buds occasionally do not power up when removed from case or only the right powers up. Large size for the amount of recharges you get compared to others. Battery should be bigger for a case this size.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Best Wireless Buds in Their Class,"First, I have to admit that the seller gives a free wireless charging pad for your review, hence the large number of reviewers.  However, I am reasonably happy with my purchase.  The sound is close to the best I have seen in wireless earbuds, especially at this price point.  They are the clear leader as far a bass is concerned.  I bought these earbuds really for one reason only; to workout in a high-cardio environment where I sweat profusely.  I must say that these earbuds have so far lived up to the challenge.  I do recommend them if you want reasonably good sound, waterproof performance, and a decent price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Thank you 👍","Every now and then a person can come across something that make them question what they were doing before, this product made me do that, made me think why would I ever pay a Premium price when I can get a better Quality for no less than 3 times less money. The sound and noise cancellation alone should cost way more. I definitely will be getting this again and again also I will be recommending them to family and friends.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for the price.,"Quality of sound is good.  Noise cancellation ... I still hear all external noise when I'm using the earphones, so I'm not sold on it.  The battery life is near what is stated.
The weird thing that has got me scratching my head is that since I added this to my iphone, my other apps are acting up.
Could be a really odd coincidence, but all of a sudden when I turn on the camera app, my phone timer kicks on (as if I'm in a call)  When I go to Shazam (earpieces not active), the phone timer goes on.  I have needed to turn off my bluetooth to get normal functionality back.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Hear better ... without wires,"Although Bluetooth technology has been around for a while, these ear-buds seem to use a better technology and better environmental protection or proofing of each of the earbuds.  Connection and pairing is simple; nothing new other than have the source and destination be aware of each other. Listening is even easier, as they disappear from being noticed as there are no wires to distract one from doing something without the worry of losing an earpiece.
The TOZO T10 Bluetooth ear buds both charge in a charging case that is included, and they can be recharged even when the charge base is not connected to power. I enjoy the freedom and the quality of sound they produce. They are great for some bass-ness of beat but have a tremendous range for the full audio spectrum.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good quality,"My wife really likes this ear buds , the battery life is not bad, and with the carrying case quickly charging them, that's good, she likes the fact that the case can be wireless charged she just places them in the pad and they are good",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Rich sound but not deep bass,"I bought them because the description said deep bass. They have crystal clear and rich sound but not deep bass as it described to me, I think it sounds more treble than bass. They took longer time to pair with my phone compare to my Geekee earbuds. I have not tested about how long they last after a full charged yet.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for a great price! Wireless charging case!!!,"I purchased this product to replace my wireless earphone from Plantronics. I used for a while, but it really didn't fit my ear perfectly. Since it didn't fit perfectly, the sound was not good and was able to ear all noises from outside. At last, my cat chewed on the earphone and I had to say bye to my Plantronics. I searched a lot for a replacement and I decided to go with earbuds because my cat can't chew on it.
This product provides better sound quality (it has enough bass if you are bass lover), good noise canceling (not like the high-end noise-canceling headphones, but it works great!), and the wireless charging case is a huge bonus.
The only downside about it is that it does not have control of your music. For instance, you cannot move to next/previous track and you cannot control your volume. It has to be controlled on your phone or connected device.
Also, it sounds like I talk from far away when I call with someone.
Except for these cons, everything works like or better than those wireless earbuds out in the market for more than $50.
I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for cheap wireless earbuds with good sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great product, excellent customer service",I was pleasantly surprised to find that these were of high quality. They sound just as good as my daughter much more expensive earbuds. Excellent customer service too. They are constantly checking if I am satisfied with the product. Would highly recommend them for people who want a great set of earbuds without paying a premium price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product and excellent customer service!,"I originally posted a review saying these ear buds seem to fit well and the sound is pretty good, but they were cutting in and out. Their customer service contacted me directly and offered a full refund or replacement pair which is awesome. I opted for a new set because I do love the fit and the sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, but left earbud cuts off when moving your head","I love the size and fit of these earbuds. Sound quality is great and the bass has a richness to it. These fit snug in my ear and you cannot hear that much of the surrounding noise. One thing I have noticed is when I turn my head to the right or sometimes to the left, the sound drops for a moment mainly in my left earbud. When I straighten my head there is less of a chance of the sound being dropped. I can’t figure out what is causing the sound to drop when I turn my head.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for the price!,"Really enjoying this product. I’ve been using them for a few weeks, and they are my first Bluetooth headphones. Going from being tied to a cable to being free to move around is amazing! These headphones sound great for the price. The noise cancelling depends more on the ear bud and the fit to your ear so that is a bit subjective in my opinion. I see several complaints that they aren’t waterproof because they don’t work when you swim. The headphones are waterproof...Bluetooth; however, is not. So these are just fine in the shower/bath or just hanging around water. Just be careful not to drop them. I wish the charging cord was a bit longer but the base charges quickly so it isn’t usually a problem.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound quality,"Tozo T10 earbuds are easy to pair, it’s adjust steady to your ear, in my opinion good choice price valued. After I tested pair with my computer and mobile phone, soon notice its quality built in immersive sound are intrinsic characteristics suited of this device. Almost compared one of one with high expensive brands except for the price.
 I was surprised to find that battery autonomy lasted over four hours playing music and the charging case provided extra full recharges. Haven’t test the water capabilities yet.
So far highly recommended.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good set of Wire less Earbuds,"I've had these TOZO T10 earbuds for about 2 months now with no real issues. They have good battery life and I've even taken them out swimming for a bit - while not submerging them of course - with no issues.

The only CON I can say so far is that they sometimes don't connect well all the time. It seems like there can be interference's here and there but nothing that has been too bad for me.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
very easy set up and use,"I had another wireless bluetooth earpiece that died on me and I wanted to get another bc I absolutely hate cords and I needed an earpiece to use in bed at night so my man doesn't have to listen to my whatever I happen to be watching on my IPad.  I read other reviews on how to pair each earpiece separately (can't remember which reviewer but thank you!!!) and it works but to perfection.  I love that I can listen to one earpiece while the other one stays charged.  The only thing that would make it better is if the individual earpieces were smaller.  I mean maybe I just have a small hear but I feel like they stick out a bit when I have them in.  I only use them at night in bed so far so I guess it hardly matters if they stick out.  Overall, extremely satisfied with purchase and would recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High quality earbuds for a very reasonable price.,"I had been looking for some affordable earbuds that still had decent sound and bass, but other brands' reviews were mixed. These came up on a flash sale so I decided to bite. I'm sure glad I did. I use it exclusively for working out at the gym, and they do a great job. They tune out background noise, have ample bass, and stay put in the ear.  I was sold.  So much so that when I accidentally lost the pair on an airplane, I went and bought a second set.  So I've now bought two of these, and would recommend them to anyone shopping at this price point.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds!,I honestly wanted the apple ones. But I wanted to give them a shot and I am glad that I did. Great sound and great battery. I barely charge the case and I use them everyday. I had an issue with the right side earbud and contacted the company and they walked me through step by step trying to fix it. Couple months later I had the same issue. I contacted them and they didn’t hesitate to replace it with a new one without having to return the old one. They truly care about your satisfaction.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOZO T10 wireless earbuds,"I was not sure if this design would work well staying in my ear, they work great and stay put when I am working out.

REMARKABLY SATISFYING PERFORMANCE AND PRESENTATION,"I came across the TOZO T10 earbuds on an Amazon Flash Sale and decided to give them a listen. Long story short--these are keepers.

The sound will never compare to wired earbuds in the $100+ range, but they certainly sound good enough for casual listening. Add in the fact that these are wireless comfortable  BLUE TOOTH instruments, and you're looking at a remarkable value. The earbuds, battery-charger case and documentation all look first class and solidly built. The case is charged via USB and holds enough battery power to charge a re-charge the buds a couple of times. Give them a try--for the price, you won't be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product and exemplary company follow up,"Product works well. Easily paired and so very convenient to use. I love the ability to use the right earbud while leaving the other in the case. Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Connectivity is a huge issue,"The headphones sounded great, cut out noise, and the battery was great. Overrall really liked it. The problem. Connectivity was terrible. It's not a faulty product. Many others have the issue. If my phone was in my pocket, it would cut in and out. If I covered a earbud with my hand, that earbud would completely disconnect. If my phone was 4 feet away, it would disconnect. I really really wanted to enjoy the product, but when I worked out, it would cut it and out. Disappointed :(",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic Earbuds at an amazing price!,I bought these to replace my lost Jabra 65t's and couldn't bear to drop another $150.  The T10's are Fantastic and in every respect as good or better than the Jabra's.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out they can charge wirelessly!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Well made , great sound, won't fall out!","I'm very impressed with these earbuds, I primarily got them becuase they're portable but I've been happily surprised by how well they isolate noise, using them at work really helped drown out my noisy co workers. I've been longboarding with them in, so far they're comfortable and haven't fell out which happened with my last pair. The bass is low, the voice clarity is great and wireless charging is a nice bonus feature :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, fit and quality at a fraction of the price","I finally broke down and decided to get a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds.  I was overwhelmed by the seemingly endless choices on Amazon, but settled on the TOZO T10s after seeing so many 5-star reviews and the price (I even got them delivered a day earlier than expected).
I walk a mile from the train station to my office and back every day and am very satisfied with this product.  The sound is full and clear with just enough bass to compliment the other instruments rather than drown them out.  The fit is excellent (I recommend taking the time to find the right tips before making any judgements) and the sound isolation is good enough that I can hear my music or podcasts clearly without being completely cut off from my surroundings.  The fact that they are waterproof is a nice feature, which is why I purchased a pair for my fiancee (she uses them for her workouts and is quite happy with them as well).
Pairing was a breeze, and the quality of the earbuds and charging case is top-notch.
To anyone who is considering paying a premium for Bose, Sennheiser or any other ""top"" manufacturer: stop looking and buy the TOZO T10s.  You won't regret it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A College Student's Thoughts,"After losing my pair of Apple Earbuds I needed an alternative, as a college student I'm always moving around and fretting from place to place so I wanted something wireless. I already had Beats so I considered airpods but the expense was a deal-breaker. I found these and was highly impressed. The sound is nearly as good as my beats, over-the-ear headphones, they fit very well in my ear, are comfortable, and connect flawlessly to my phone each time I use them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A unit to enjoy,"I Purchased this unit after reading the reviews and was worried it will not be as mentioned. Once the unit came and I open the box, I liked the sturdy structure and the small shape of the earbuds. They were almost fully charged and it only took less than a minute to pair with my phone and the sound was amazing. The ability to have both earbuds on at the same time with the right one in control is great, and when I just place the buds in the box they are not longer connected. I also liked the box, small and wireless charging abilities, it makes it easy to charge and make sure you never have the box which is a charging battery never empty. For now I like the units and will say great accept the battery life is only about 3-4 hours in my use. Even that is not an issue, I like them a lot
I highly recommend them as unit with an amazing price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality for the price!,"I was impressed with the quality of the product while un-boxing and setting up.  Then when paired with my Galaxy S-10+, I was impressed again with the sound quality and bass response from these headphones considering the price range.  I like the way they fit and the quality of the charging case and headphone build in general.  Would definitely recommend these for someone looking for workout or running headphones as they are ipx8 waterproof.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding product and service,"I was first impressed with the packaging of these earbuds. I know that doesn't add to the sound quality but it certainly gives a purchaser a great first impression. In addition, I had occasion to contact the company and their response was both very prompt and extremely satisfying. Wow! I didn't expect that.
The sound quality of these earbuds is excellent. At my age my hearing is not the best but the sound output has made me forget that limitation. Great product and great value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
What a Difference!,"I had been using earbuds that had a wire between them while working around the house, the yard, and at the gym.  I broke them recently when working out in the yard when the wire got caught and pulled the earbud out of my left ear and broke.  Now with the wireless earbuds I don't have that problem.  The sound is great and such an improvement.  I found the ""Important Notes & Trouble Shootings"" tips that were sent by email after I registered were very helpful in setting up the earbuds and using them.  I am very happy with this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No longer skeptical,"I have to say, I was skeptical of these when deciding to buy them.  For the cost of some of the other ones out there, I really wasn't all that sure.  However, these turned out to be a great buy.  I've only had about 2 hours of listening with them, but I think their quality is great.  They fit comfortably in the ear and don't have that ""getting ready to fall out"" feel that others I have worn do.

The battery case is nice and sturdy and convienently stores the buds, which are just the right size.  Pairing was a breeze and I can walk around a pretty wide area before the signal gets lost.  My 15 year old Tech son was also impressed.

I'm glad I bought them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love and Hate,"My first bluetooth headset. The fit and finish is great and they're durable. The concept and pairing is simple and straight forward. Generally speaking they function as advertised at a good price.

Sound is good and what you would expect for the cost. You shouldn't expect studio quality at this price.

The battery life is so so. I had a home project where I was listening to a podcast while working. The lack of cords was great, but then the battery died and that kind of sucked. Generally for going to the gym and keeping them charged they work well. I do wish it came with a longer usb cord. I had to use an extension for safe storage and charging in my car.

Now the hate. Slight turning of the head causes audio to phase in and out. It's not like it's always noticeable but its odd and sometimes you're not sure if your left or right earbud is working. It's not constant and not a deal breaker but it's a fault of the product and the reason I gave 3 stars.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
First Pair of True Wireless Earbuds,Great product.  These bluetooth headphones are a perfect mix of things that I want.  Waterproof and truly wireless.  Use one or both and while they are labeled right and left put them in whichever ear you want as they are the same shape.  Wireless charging is quiet convenient as I already wirelessly charge my phone and can now just use the same pad to charge the case which charges the headphones.  So far I am very much enjoying them and look forward to much more use!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
10/10 Would Recommend!!!,"I bought my brother some airpods for his birthday but didn’t want the same hefty price tag for my earbuds (I previously had the Powerbeats 3 by Dre but lost them), and ended up buying these after reading some stellar reviews.

First off, the earbuds don’t fall off your ears easily! Which is what worried me about the apple airpods - they don’t stay secure in my ears. But these feel comfy and fit snug.

Secondly, the noise cancellation + sound of the earbuds are state of the art! I cannot recommend these enough. I can hear the noise really well and all the highs and lows of the song.

Lastly, I always feel like non-“professional” grade bluetooth earbuds have difficulty in pairing from one device to another. These pair seamlessly from my phone to my laptop with no difficulty.

I also read that these are waterproof but have not tested them.

All in all, I would recommend these in a heartbeat. I would buy these again if my pair were to stop working! (Oh, they also have a 1 year warranty - will update if I ever do end up needing it within this year).",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
stylish with good sound quality,"These headphones are great! I wanted to splurge a little on bluetooth earphones but didn’t want to go the apple pods route. These ones are pretty good looking, have great sound quality, and the carrying case is nice. The only complaint I have is that I wish the earbuds didn’t slide around so much in my ear sometimes. Gotta get the placement just right.

I was super disappointed when one of my buds stopped working suddenly, but I just emailed customer service and they’re sending me a replacement free of charge! They answered super quick (I honestly didn't think they would answer at all) which was nice, because I can't survive long without working earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Solid earbuds at a fantastic price!,"So I dropped my AirPods in some water for about 15 seconds and they started to fail over the course of a year. I was tired of spending that much money on something so small and fragile. Saw the Tozo reviews and figured I’d give them a shot. Let me say that I’m really glad I did. I would be impressed with them at twice the price but for around $50.00, they are a really great deal! Sure, they don’t access Siri like the AirPods, but I rarely used that feature anyway. Very happy with my purchase. Totally recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great purchase! Would recommend to a friend,"I got the blue Tozo T10. They have a very sleek design and can fit in my pocket or in any part of my backpack or purse. They fit great in my ears with the little buds that came with it, but I love having the option to switch what size the buds were in case they didn’t fit. When running, they stayed in my ears, and I ran around a small indoor track and was able to leave my phone in the locker on the track and solely control it through my smart watch. The Bluetooth was perfect for my whole run.

I really like how these headphones are sound proof. They can tune out the noises of a coffee shop with consistent music coming through the ears.

Great purchase and a great (free) warranty that comes with it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Buyer beware!  These are garbage!,"The first pair I received we're defective- the left earbud continually dropped out.  I contacted Tozo, and they agreed to send me a new pair, IF I GAVE THEM A 5 STAR AMAZON REVIEW.  So I did, in hopes the second pair would work.  Well, they second pair I received worked WORSE than the first.  Don't bother with these- as suspected, you get what you pay for - garbage!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
By far and waway the best bang for your buck under $50,"I lose my headphones a lot, and shop around a bit when I repurchase, because you never know what badass thing is around the corner for less money (or occasionally more).  With that said, these kick the sh!t out of any other headphones I've bought under $50, and I'm hoping to find the pair I recently mislaid because the Tagry earbuds I bought to replace them don't hold a candle to the Tozos.  Stop looking in the $20-$30 range and just drop the $40.  you'll be glad you did.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound!!,"So I was looking for some headphones without wires and after reading reviews from the high end to the low end, I decided to go with these after a lot of good reviews.  I was looking for some strictly for the gym, something that could last at least 2 hours or more.  So far I love them.
Pro:
Wireless Charging
Great sound
Great fit, once you find the right tips, you will never have to adjust them while in your ear
Easy pairing

Cons:
No volume control, but I use my smart watch to adjust the volume
No control over skipping or repeating a song.

Even with the cons, I still love them and would buy a 2nd pair if they went cheaper, I cant say much about the battery life since I have never worn them down.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing sound!,"I bought these for my daughter, and I was lucky enough to catch them on sale. We have never bought any kind of ear buds like these before, so I didn't want to spend a ton and her not like the sound quality. These blew us all away! The sound is amazing, they cancel noise pretty darn well, she has even taken them in the shower a few times and they work exactly as they should. The one concern about them she has is the earbuds can't be far away from each other. She likes to use only one bud most of the time. So when she's video calling her friends she has to carry the other ear bud on her. She can't just leave it laying down on her desk and walk around the room. But, that's personal preference, and these earbuds are still a 5 star product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Not recommend, Not at all","Tozo wireless buds sound average.
The battery life is pretty ok and the fact that the case charges the buds is nice.

They become uncomfortable after extended wear and fall out alot. (I tried all 3 sizes)
Connecting the buds is annoying. It's not hard to do but the stupid things beep for several minutes after connecting to the device.
At 20% batt the buds annoy you until you charge them. "" Beep* beep* low battery please charge""
Over and over until they die or you take them out.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Better quality than Airpods,"My only dislike:  the noise canceling,  wearing between calls acts like earplugs.  I have been told sound isn't great on receiving end of call.

Fantastic Ear buds. Definately worth the purchase!,Such a great purchase. I am highly impressed with the quality of the product. They have really great sound quality compared to regular earbuds. I am a fan of noise cancelation head phones so these wireless earbuds have surprised me with the same quality of sounds and the best part is the 4 different size fittings that are included so you can get that perfect fit in your ear. No more earbuds falling out. Another plus is they are waterproof. They pair up easily with my phone every time i use them.

Overall very good,"These TOZO earbuds are pretty good, I've had my fair share of wireless earbuds all for around the same price as these.  For the pricepoint, TOZO provides a remarkably outstanding product.  The bass and sound quality is great.  The only personal issues I have had are that sometimes they tend to slip out of my ear but that may be to not using the proper fitting or sweat during exercise.  Also sometimes I do have trouble having the earbuds link to each other before the right one links to my phone exclusively.  Overall im very happy and satisfied with my purchase I just hope i dont lose them. again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound however has issues...,"Earbuds work well for the most part. As far as sound goes they are good. They function as expected and are crisp and clear. They do cancel any noise around you when fitted into your ear properly. However, the fit in your ear is not the best. If you have small ears they tend not to fit well and feel like they are going to fall out at any moment.

The wireless charging is a huge plus. If anything it outweighs any of the other issues this product has.

If you live in a major city (Chicago) do not expect these to work. Home life and outside the city they are perfect. Once you enter the earbuds have a hard time with buildings and other bluetooth devices. The earbuds cut out and a majority of the time you only get sound out of the right ear. As soon as you enter a building both ears come back and sound quality is improved.

I would not recommend using these to talk on the phone. Hard to hear the other person.

Over all they are earbuds and while not great they fit the bill and play music most of the time.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not that loud,"I bought these headphones for working out but they don’t stay in my ear that great. I had to change the buds and it got better but not great. I have this issue with a lot of headphone however, Apple headphones fit my ear sooo.

The sound was ok. I like my headphones to be deafening! I want to not be able to hear anything outside of the music. Not the case with these. I put on Booty Work by TPain and It didn’t knock like I needed it to. I am going to keep em but had I gotten the chance to sample them, I would have passed.

Excellent value!,"There's a reason why more than 83% of the 7,000+ people who reviewed this gave it 4 or 5 stars. For ear buds, the bass is incredible. You may have to try all the different sizes they provide to get the right fit. If you don't, they may fall out or you may not hear the excellent range very well. Love that these and the case are IPX8. Also love that the case can wirelessly charge on a qi pad. Call quality is also excellent. I returned a $200 pair of headphones due to how well these work and sound. I guess the only downside is not being able to rewind or skip tracks. Definitely not a deal breaker for me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound quality,"I've searched bluetooth earbuds having good sound& long last battery, and I finally got this one after read many reviews & compared other brand's bludtooth earbuds.
f.y.i., I attached photo with tflash memory, it's small enough to carry on whenever, and easily faired well with my smartphone(galaxy9) as soon as I pulled out of case.
Especially, sound is really dynamic when I heared the drum performance,it's really outstanding than any other my headset,bluetooth earbuds,earphone..
One thing good point is that I can use the left side earbud while put right side earbud sitting in the case,
when it's run out of battery for left side earbud, I put it and keep listening to music only with right side earbud,
so its playing time can be doubled for me.

great but... I received the wrong color.,"These ear buds are great. The sound quality is very good, the battery life is decent and so is the range. It also comes with a neat charger case. But...

Quality sound quality product ! I even love the recharging case,I refuse to pay four times this to try the Apple earbuds because I was afraid they would fall out of my ear and I would lose them. These had such great reviews so I got them and I absolutely love them and they've never fallen out of my ear (when inserted correctly -  twist after putting in ear)  i've already told a half dozen people about these! Thanks for good sound in a quality product! I even love the recharging case!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbuds at a Great Price,"I ordered these earbuds on the recommendation of a co-worker.  I work in a construction environment and in my position I spend a lot of my day on the phone.  Trying to find a quiet place to talk on the phone with construction going on all around is a challenge, so I wanted to get a product that would allow me to use the phone without having to find a quiet spot.

When this product arrived, the buds were fully charged.  They paired instantly and do so whenever I remove them from the case.  Since the package arrived on a Sunday, I was not at work and could not put them to the test for the primary purpose I had gotten them.  Just to test them out, I started listening to some of my music and was blown away!  For the price point, these have some of the best sound quality I have experienced.  I am not one to listen to music on my phone, but I am starting to rethink that decision.  These earphones give a full, rich quality that I would expect from a much higher-priced unit.

My experience working with these units on the jobsite was just as satisfying.  High sound quality and good noise exclusion during phone conversations.  They make my work life better.

I give this product five stars all day long.  I have not had an issue with fit or comfort, the charging case is good for about 4 full recharges and the quality of the construction is top-notch.  Well done.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bargain Quality Wireless Earbuds,"Looking for something to use running that wouldn't slip out when the others always seems to fall out or there were too many wires getting tangled. After buying a number of pairs these seemed to fit the bill. They're lightweight enough to stay put and it's a good balance of sound quality and noise cancelling as I don't want to block out 100% of the traffic around me when I'm out on a hilly road and need to keep my wits about me. The carrying case was a definite bonus as it charges them too. The hardest part is testing all the various earbud combinations to figure out which size works best to keep them put. Winner Winner me!

Update** After a week of using these I noticed the same quality issues other users faced where the sound cuts out intermittently. It's really quite annoying. I've done the troubleshooting but haven't been able to resolve the issue yet and may return these in the next week if the MFG isn't able to help.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great wireless headphones without high price!,"I bought these as a gift for my husband after his previous wireless headphones stopped working/charging.  These got good reviews but were also a very reasonable price.  He is SO happy with them!  The sound quality is excellent and the charging case is high quality.  They did not totally cancel out noise when I used them but not sure if that is just me.  I did a good amount of research and most wireless, bluetooth headphones are pretty pricey with variable ratings.  I'm now ordering a pair for myself.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor Connection,"I never gave a product a 1 star review. I always practice an attitude of gratitude. Nevertheless, it would be irresponsible and unethical of me not to warn you of the sad truth of this product which is: The connection of the left earpiece is very weak.

Before purchasing, I saw a review saying: ""Ignore all the positive reviews"" or something to that effect. Still, I was incredulous.

At the gym, the left earpiece's sound would continuously click and the sound would continuously turn on and off. It may have to do with the fact that there are a multitude of other wireless headphone users there. Still, the whole purpose of these earbuds was for me to use at the gym.

I followed the instructions and did a reset of the Bluetooth connection, the problem still persisted.

Sound quality, great.
Packaging, great.
Bluetooth connection, poor.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product.....for 3 months.,"Overall a great product.....while it lasted. Got this late March,early April 2019. It was such a good investment at the time. I was able to go 4-5 hours of run time. Put it in the charging case during luch(45 mins) . And had another 4-5 hours of play time. This was such a good pair of headphones. But just recently the right earbud doesnt want to pair. It's not even visible to any phone. I reset it numerous time and nothing.
I'm tempted to buy another pair as $50 isnt that expensive. I just cant see myself buy this every 3 months.

So everything was great except it doesnt last long.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice for the price,"These ear buds are pretty good for the price. The left bud drops out every once in a while but comes back on in a second or two at the most, probably not worth the hassle to return & I can live with it for now.

I don't miss my Bosè QC-35,"I have to say that I have a pair of Bosè QC-35 as my primary headphones. But in summer they get steamy, and for travelling they are rather big, so I started to look for some more portable and smaller headphones. I didn't want to pay $150 for some Apple AirPods, so I did a research and found this TOZO.  And I love them. I've had them for a couple of weeks, and I'm still on the ""you're-the-love-of-my-life"" phase; so, I will try to be as objective as possible.

[Sound Quality]
Powerful basses and crisp higher notes. Once you fit your earbuds correctly, you will feel amazed by the bass sound. Choose the ear cushions that fit snuggle and comfortable, but don't let any gaps in your ears.

[Comfortability]
They come with 4 sizes of ear cushions, so for sure you will have a pair that fits you correctly. As I said above, choose the ones that fit comfortable and does not leave gaps in your ears for better sound quality.

[Noise Isolation]
Fantastic. I used them in the airplane, and you hardly notice you're flying. I use them at the office and people have to wave their hands to me, because I don't listen a thing outside my music (volume at 70%).

[Battery Life]
I've been using them for 10 days, 1 hour a day aproximately. This is the first time I recharge the base. So, I could say that total battery life, including base charge is around 10 hours.

[Waterproof]
I took a shower with them. Worked perfectly.

[Other Things]
Pairing is easy. Though somehow I turn them off, and store them in the case, and after a while they re-connect to my iPhone. What I did was ""disconnect"" the earbuds in the iPhone settings and it stopped completely. Now I have to manually connect them to the iPhone everytime I use them. No big deal.

[Overall]
You don't have to pay $150 for AirPods. Yes, they are more fancy, look nicer and they are connected to Siri, but I don't think the price difference is worth it. So far, I'm in love with this TOZO earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super if you like things that don't work well,"Used this morning for the first time.  They fit in well, but wow is the sound HORRIBLE.

A nice alternative to Galaxy Buds,"Originally, I lost my Galaxy Buds so I needed to replace them. After doing some research, I came across the TOZO earbuds, which have very similar, if not the same, features and quality at an affordable cost. The earbuds can be used independently which is nice for a phone conversation, and you can wear them both at the same time especially for music. The sound quality is very crisp, and the background noise is very minimal. I do like the charging feature with being able to wireless charge my earbuds with my phone. Overall, I do like this product and I highly recommend it!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Light weight, comfortable, & easy to pair.","Just bought my first pair of wireless earbuds.  So far extremely happy with the choice I made.  I have them paired with bluetooth on my new LG tv.

Battery life is awful,Works very well but the battery life is terrible so I’m only giving it 1 star. Literally not last 3.5 hours even after being charged up all night long.

While I haven’t had them long enough to really give a full review of the product features, I just had to give 5stars for customer service alone.  I received the headphones on Monday and the right ear bud wasn’t playing any sound.  I emailed them about my problem.  They advised I reset them.  I had done this before, but I tried again, and it worked but only temporarily.  I again emailed back with the issues I was having, and the representative I was corresponding with was so helpful.

THEY STAY IN YOUR EARS!!! :D,"I ordered this product because I needed some nice wireless earbuds to workout in. I can't tell you how sick and tired I was of having to maneuver around my Apple earphones with the wires. The Tozo 10 bluetooth earbuds come with three different sizes of buds so you can get the right fit for your ears, and it also comes with a case that is the charger, and a cord to charge the case with. Once the case is fully charged, you can get a good few charges out of it, no problem. I worked out with them for the first time yesterday actually, and it went perfectly. It almost feels too easy, being so hands free and not having to worry about the wires getting in my way or tripping me up when I'm working out vigorously. To sum it up, this product is AMAZING and I would 10/10 recommend it to any and everyone. Not everyone can afford AirPods (I sure can't LOL), and Amazon has great prices, so if you're looking for some awesome wireless earbuds, go ahead and order these TODAY! :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
mixed feelings,"The sound is better than other headphones that I've tried but it never connects to my phone without me going to the ""previously connected devices"" option and the charging case seems to run dry on a single charge (it seems to keep draining regardless of how charged the headphones are).

Cheaper than Boise,"Ordered these to resolve issues with other ear buds falling out of my ears.  Was not sure what to order.

I don't really like anything in or on my ears, but these are the  best I have found so far.  Anticipate keeping these since they met all my criterion.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and excellent service!,"I bought these ear buds a few days ago. I love the sound quality and the noise cancellation is surprising effective. Plus, the headphones have a very deep bass which is hard to find in a true wireless set.

Great sound quality at an amazing price!,I received these about 5 or so days ago and so far I am pretty impressed. They are very well made quality wise and the sound quality honestly shocked me was way better than most other forms of earbuds I've had in the past. I really love the charging case that they come in. Fits in my pocket so I can care it around at work and charge basically whenever I need too. The only down side is the battery life. Now for the record the estimated amount of hours on full charge I believe is 3 to 4 hours which so far that is true. I rated the battery life 3 of 5 because I know of other wireless earbuds that last 7 or more hours each charge. I also haven't used them for phone calls mostly listening to music or watching youtube. But I will say that while I was out walking I tried to call upon my Google assistant with my phone in my pocket with the earbuds in and it couldn't pick up my voice.  But for what I wanted to do with them I can just wish they lasted more and a few hours between charge.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I found the fit to be very comfortable and really appreciated the extra ear bud covers to be able to make sure I got a snug fit. No problems with them falling out! The pairing and ease of use did not require multiple steps and they connected with no problems and are easy to use.

I am enjoying my listening very much.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bang for the buck earphones!,"I originally bought this as a true wireless earbud system since the wires on my older set kept getting stuck on my neck during workouts. This took care of the problem and more - I was genuinely surprised by the sound these little units produce as I purchased this without any real expectations and mainly bought these for a ""function over form"" item. The best thing I like about these are how long the battery has the potential to last - just bring the case with you and you have 4 full charges of your earset (which last approx 4-6 hours each for me, not bad at all if you ask me) The earbuds also come with a variety of different sizes of earpieces so you can get your best fit in order for the earbud to stay in your ear. They are pretty comfy! I haven't gotten these wet yet, but another part of my purchasing this earset was due to their water resistance. It was the highest (that I found) whilst shopping other similar earset and although I have yet to test that aspect of it, I am fairly confident that it will deliver based on all other aspects being delivered, if not exceeded.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Impressed by the sound quality,"I have a Pixel 2 phone that comes with no audio jack. I've been looking for a bluetooth earbud for a while. After reading the reviews and answered questions for this product, I decided to give it a try. The price is reasonable comparing with similar products.

It comes with a well designed box that contains a charging case with a pair of earbuds inside,  a user guide,  three earbud caps with different sizes and a lanyard.

For $30-$50 bucks this is a good deal with built in wireless charging case compatibility,"Pros:
-the charging case is compatible with wireless charging pads in addition to the traditional micro USB charging method
-price point (especially if purchased during lighting deal)
-amazing sound for this price
-comfortable with the correct fitted earbud tips

Cons:
-charging case continues to discharge earbuds even when they are powered off inside the charging case, depleting the charging case in about 6 days without any use
-earbuds are a little large with regards to protrusion out of ears
-battery charging case could have a bigger battery for longer earbud charging times

The long version:
What makes these earbuds worth purchasing is they sound good overall. There's a little bit of emphasis on the bass but that is mentioned in the breakdown of the product, so I knew prior to purchasing these. The bass isn't so strong that it drowns out the mids or the highs. The wireless charging case compatibility with wireless charging pads truly makes these wireless.

I can't speak for those that have had a bad experience with these headphones, but I'm completely satisfied with these earbuds. What makes these earbuds and earbuds similar to these earbuds noise cancellation effective is fitting the proper earbud tips on the earbuds for your ears. That's not to take anything away from these earbuds because they are exactly everything I expected them to be. I didn't buy these for phone calls nor have I tested them for phone calls so I can't comment on that aspect.

Update 8/4/19
I noticed one major flaw with this earbuds that made me take away two stars because the charging case is a very important part of why I purchased these. It's important for the charging case to be able to hold a charge for a long period of time (at least 30 days) without having to charge the case when the earbuds are powered off inside the charging case. For some unknown reason the charging case will continue to discharge with the earbuds powered off inside the charging case. It seems as though the earbuds turn themselves back on when placed inside the charging case. I haven't actually tracked how long the case holds a charge with the earbuds powered off inside the case but I suspect the case will loose its charge in less than 7 days. This is not normal because I have other wireless earbuds that don't have this problem with the charging case discharging after the earbuds are placed inside the case sitting for many days, sometimes weeks before I use the earbuds again.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality over battery,I absolutely love these headphones! They sound really good the last pair of headphones I had was Powerbeats 3 but my cat chewed the cord so I bought these for my birthday! I have to say these do a really good job of staying in my ears once I switched to the smallest ear pieces.  I can’t hear anything around me which I like so people do t talk to me lol. It also looks like you aren’t wearing any headphones. Down side is that you can’t skip or replay through the headphones you can only pause . You can use Siri to change your music if you don’t want to pick up your phone. The other downs side they don’t hold a charge for long about 2 1/2 hours. So always have your case charged. They do charge pretty fast though so that’s a plus. Other than the battery life and unable to skip or replay music the sound is really amazing I’m not mad about this purchase at all!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Absolute junk. Positive reviews must be fake,"After seeing all of the positive reviews on these earbuds I thought I would give them a try, especially being they are affordable. My gut told me there is no way a $50-60 set of bluetooth earbuds would actually be any good but I tried anyway. Boy was my gut right!

Many hours of frustration and multiple sets of exchanges later I can say with absolute certainty that these are absolute junk and could even be a scam. You are greeted with nice packaging, your normal warranty card and quick guide (both of which are so poorly translated that it is laughable). The charging case is actually very nice and probably the best feature of the whole set. Once the headphones were charged I tried them out and immediately had audio cutouts constantly. The left earbud would constantly lose connection with the right and this causes the right side audio to fade in and out. I then did the hard reset per the instruction multiple times with the same result. The funny thing is, the issue was the worst when I turned my head right and slightly up. I also tested on multiple bluetooth phones and smart watches to no avail.

I requested an exchange and the new set promptly arrived. This set was a bit better at home but as soon as I went out or to the gym they were almost completely useless with audio cutouts so frequent you couldn't tell what song you were listening to. If you run with only the right earbud turned on it is a better experience but this is in no way acceptable. Repeated the process again but again, same result. On top of this, when I did have a good connection the sound quality was absolutely awful. Very compressed sounding with no low end response. Finally gave up and got a refund.

TL;DR - Left earbuds cuts out constantly and causes the right to cut as well. Bluetooth is very unstable and weak and the sound quality is sub-par at best. A bunch of wasted time and multiple sets later I returned the last set.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great sound and customer service.,"I received these as a gift and loved them. They produce great sound and are very comfortable. One earbud ceased working and I contacted their customer service. They responded very quickly and resolved the issue by sending me a new set.  Great company to work with. I would highly recommend and buy again. Thanks for standing behind your product.

UPDATE:  I received my replacement 2 DAYS after contacting customer service with my problem. I could not imagine receiving such fast and satisfactory service. Again great product produced by a great company.  Again many thanks!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Easily charged and easily paired.,"Easy and fast charging, battery life long enough. A good company for daily life entertainment and especially during sports or some outdoor activities. I especially like the way the product got paired with my phone, previously I owned two other Bluetooth earphones, both have annoying process to get paired and after several days of using, you even had to disconnect and re-pair. For this one, so far the pair process has been going well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works Well,"Had an issue, quickly addressed by seller and replaced. Absolutely love these buds. Recommended them to all my friends and family. Love that I could use one bud while the other one charges, charge last awhile. Absolutely worth every penny.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Faulty Left Earbud,"Only the right earbud worked. The second device connected every time... however, not a single sound. I was sure the left earbud connected, because the automated voice said “second device paired” and i was able to pause and resume my music using the left earbud (useless regarding sound though). I tried resetting it as mentioned, I followed the manual’s Bluetooth connection/pairing directions to the “t”... nothing.  I’m not one to instantly return a product if I find something complicated: I reset my phone, I “forgot the device”, I did everything.  I cannot rate battery life, sound quality, etc, due to it not working as it is supposed to (as 2 functioning earbuds).",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Lightweight and Lasting!,"I've been using these earbuds for the past couple weeks now to use when I'm doing my cardio workouts. I used to use my wired apple earpods, but was annoyed/distracted with the cable. I never owned a pair of bluetooth earbuds and I'm very happy with these! They pair fast and conveniently with my phone, comfortable in my ears (I used the smallest size), and have great sound quality while I focus on my workout! No more fiddling with the earbud staying in my ears or a cable bouncing around! I also love the case they come in along with showing how much battery life is left (lasts a long time). I have yet to test it's waterproof effectiveness, but haven't had the need to at the moment. Overall, a great product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Customer Service - Replaced Defective Left Channel.,"Left channel went quiet after the first 20 minutes of use.  Customer Service promptly sent a replacement.
Audio quality is supurb.
Compared to Letsfit D39, it is a little bit heavier which i notice while running.  It has the exact same female voice saying left, right, pairing, and paired, so it may be running the same software.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprised for a budget set of wireless earbuds,"Technology has come a long way. I'm actually pretty surprised with the sound quality of the earbuds for a set under $40. It also feels like it was quality made, too; does not feel cheap at all. I've ran with them and used it at my desk during work. I like the case design and how the case charges the earbuds when I place them back in. The only issue I have is the battery life. But I understand you can't really put a big battery in the individual earbuds. It's only going to get better when we continue advancing in battery technology. For someone who's looking for cheap but good quality wireless earbuds, I would recommend this.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great wireless headphones!!,"I purchased these headphones because I was sick of wanting to listen to music while I worked out and also worked on small projects and having a cord hanging in my way.  The Tozo T10 headphones are amazing for the price.  Syncing them to my phone and my laptop was super quick and easy with zero problems.  They are super light weight and don't fall out of my ears no matter what activity I am doing.  The charging case is very sturdy and I love that it can be charged by plugging it in or I can also set it on my cellphones wireless charging pad and charge it on that.
In this price point these are some of the best quality wireless headphones you can buy.  Lots of features and great quality - I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very poor Bluetooth connection,"I have been using these for a few weeks now during my workouts. Everything seems to work fine, except the Bluetooth connection. My pair uses the right earbud as the master and the left one as the slave (meaning my phone connects to the right side and that connects to the left one). The connection to the right earbud is ok, not good, but ok. Works fine when my phone is near me but if I venture more than 10 or so feet away in the same room it starts to cutout (note that Bluetooth should work at 30ft+ in an open space). It will also cutout if my phone is in my right pocket and I look to the left. My bigger problem is the left one. That one cuts out constantly even when my phone is in my hands. It's very annoying and causes me a lot of frustration during my workout.

Reached out to the manufacturer for a replacement, will update if the new pair is any better.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I'm giving it a 3 and I'm being generous.,"I've owned many headsets, wireless and wired alike. If I could rank this headset out of 10 it's a 5 and here's why.

The sound quality: the sound quality is alright at best, certainly nothing to ride home about. You'll get HQ music from it if you have it but it (meaning the music itself) has to be that good.

It's ""perks"": despite what's here I'll tell you the truth about this headset, it's a poor headset for exercising so don't even bother buying it for running, lifting, or any activities in general beyond walking because they will slip out with use. Additionally, DO NOT BUY this for talking, it has been the worst headset I've ever used for talking, no one can hear me and it isn't a them problem because let's face it, over 20 people with different phones can't have the same problem. Finally it's connectivity kills me, does not automatically connect with my phone and the ear buds can't be more than 1 and a half feet away from one another if not they start glitching and messing up.

It's actual pros: it's got decent battery life and it does have some water resistance, didn't want to push my luck with that though so I don't know how far that goes.

So in all and all in short I probably would not buy this headset again. You can get it, it won't be the worst thing in the world but don't expect the best.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding Earbuds,"I've used various earbuds over the years, but none compare to these! One issue I've had with others have been how they fit and feel in my ears. These have been ideal as they fit snuggly and comfortably. The sound is outstanding, which has been great while running. Highly recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic product!,"These earbuds are a great value. These earbuds not only sound great, but they cancel out so much around you. I used them at an indoor track that constantly pumps out loud music, and all I heard was what was on my earbuds. My wife and I both love them. Connecting was very easy, and they work greet with my phone and laptop. They are really comfortable and stayed in without issue for my first run, which was well over an hour. Very impressed!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good product, great customer service","I bought these earphone so I could listen to music while swimming. The sound is good, however, once your head is underwater the connection gets lost; but I least I can hear some music on and off. I had these earbud for over a month now, and the left earbud is not working. However, I contacted customer service and they were very helpful solving the problem",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product,"This is my first set of wireless headphones, and I love no longer being tethered to my devices!  My cord was always getting tangled up in things or getting in the way on the treadmill.  Why didn't I purchase some sooner??!!  These fit snugly in my ears and I haven't had a problem with them coming loose during use.  I fly frequently, and these do a decent job of blocking loud airplane noise.  I have three different devices I regularly pair with, and it isn't hard to switch between devices.  You just need to put the right headphone in the case for a moment to break the pairing and re-pair.  I haven't actually timed the battery life, but it probably lasts about 2-3 hours before they need to be placed back in the case to recharge.  The case can charge them several times before needing a recharge itself.  This product is a great value!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bass,"Finally, a pair of decent earbuds that have decent sound.  The pair I bought before these sounded like I had two tin cans on my ears and absolutely no bass.  These are excellent.  Fits in the ear nicely and they don't fall out.  The bass sounds like what bass is supposed to sound like.  I'm very pleased.  Love the charging case and the fact that you can answer calls with the earbuds.  Thank you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Headphones!,I was a little sceptic when deciding to buy this Tozo T10 wireless earbuds due to its competitive cost but once I received them and started the setup in my phone I was really surprised how good they work along the sound quality and features. Definitely is a better buy even better than expensiver or fancier brands such as Apple airpods. You need to try this!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound! Great Price!,"I've had these earbuds for just over 2 weeks and I can say that the sound is just as good as by Beats over the ear headphones, and a lot more comfortable. The fit is great and the charge lasts at least three hours ( that's as long as I've worn them at a time) and they were still going strong then. This is the first pair of earbuds I've owned and I would definitely buy another Tozo product again judging from the build quality that went into these 'buds!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Customer Support,"Initially purchased in August 2019, sound quality was intermittent. Used with an Apple 4 watch on morning walks, I had to hold my arm still to hear sound in the left ear bud. After several weeks buds refused to charge. Contacted Customer Support, explained my problem in detail, and TOZO quickly provided replacement ear buds. So far, the replacement buds work as advertised--sound is good in both ears. No issues charging.
I am especially appreciative of TOZO's customer support to ensure that all customers are satisfied with their product.
I recommend the buds to other prospective buyers.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I love these earphones!,"This product is fantastic. I’ve been using them for about a month now and they are excellent. Very durable and the sound is great. They fit well in my ears and never fall out. I’ve done sprints and runs while using these and never had an issue with them falling out or losing sound, etc. I sweat hard Whem working out and never had any kind of malfunction due to excess sweat, water, etc. In my opinion this is a perfect product for a perfect price and beats those overly priced AirPods any day!

Static in the left earbud.,"After allowing for a full charge, I did my test. The earbuds connected with each other, and then found my iPhone quickly with no issue.  However, when I used the earbuds, the left earbud throws out distorted static above the music.  It’s connection with the right ear bud fails to provide quality sound.  I also tried an audio book and same thing.  The voice speaking has a fuzzy static to it.  There is no way these are acceptable or usable.  I would love to find out I have a defective unit or a wireless channel setting I could adjust, but I didn’t see anything that detailed in the manual.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not worth it,"Overall, I am disappointed with these earbuds.  It takes awhile to pair up, they shut off and on for no reason and have very limited range.

Awesome earphones for an awesome price,"I bought the Tozo T10 for the IPX8 waterproof rating as no other wireless buds matched this rating for this price range. I was skeptical at first given the price but after using it for just a few days, I fell in love with them. The things that I like the most about these buds are:

Sound quality - for this price point, Tozo 10 does a flawless job. I use mine to listen to music, phone calls and watch TV shows. I can hear the dialogues perfectly when there is noise in the background. I don't have to rely on subtitles anymore.
Battery life - The T10s last over 3 hours of playtime on a single charge as advertised and you can charge them using the case multiple times. The wireless charging case is very handy as I can just leave the case on my wireless charger when I go to sleep. If I forget to charge the case at night, I can still charge them over USB in my car.
Perfect fit - They are a perfect fit for my ears. The earplugs come in 3 sizes but the ones it came with were just the perfect size for my ears. Most of my other earphones usually fall off from my ear or with a gentle tug on the wires but not the T10. I have used them during workouts, runs, and sometimes watch TV shows while lying on my bed and these buds won't fall off easily.
Waterproof - This was the main reason I bought the T10s. I use it to listen to music while showering as I cannot take my phone in the water and my shower is too loud to use the speakers on my phone. I had no problems showering with these on.
Noise cancelling/isolation - Although I think there isn't an active noise cancellation feature on the T10s, the perfect fit in my ears ensure high level of noise isolation. I work in an office with open floor plan and when I have these earbuds, I can barely hear people talking even if they are besides me even when I am not playing any music.
Rugged finish - Lastly, I like the finish on my Tozo T10. I have dropped them a few times on hardwood floors while taking them out or putting them on the case but the rubbery finish on the earbuds with matte surface on the button means no scratches anywhere. The build quality is very high and they don't feel cheaply made unlike some other shiny plastic earbuds out there.

The high average rating from over 4000 people is very well deserved. I would gladly buy these again as a gift during the holiday season.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bang for Your Buck!!!,"I did a bit of research to find an affordable pair of ""true-wireless"" earbuds that would work well and I was not disappointed. These earbuds are pretty awesome for their price!
I use them to listen to music every day at work and they totally cancel out the surrounding noise.
I even wore them to wash my hair and they are truly waterproof.
The only possible issue is that the connection between the earbuds and the phone becomes very spotty around the water.
Overall, very very happy with my purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing bass but will drop call in 5 minutes via Skype call but ok on cell.,I will change this to 5 stars when the vendor is able to figure out why a skype call will drop every 5 minutes.  But I can switch to music no problem and when it's connected to the cell phone the calls don't drop.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds,"These work very well and the battery will last about 3 hours on a charge.  They are a little large, but I find them comfortable enough. I’m not sure they would stay in place during activities although for my use they are fine.  The holder is also a charger and it seems like I can get 1 or maybe 2 charges before it needs to be plugged in again. They turn on when you remove them from the box and connect automatically to each other and your device. They can be used on multiple devices once you have them paired. Overall a decent product at a decent price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
More than decent quality and leaves your wallet happy!,"Had these for a solid month and a half now.. been using them daily and so far...

Pros:
1. Find the right size silicone bud allowing a snug (not vacuum-sealed) fit and noise cancellation is pretty solid. Bass is more than satisfactory.
2. Took a shower with them on and its working just fine. (don't submerge them in water though) they're water-resistant.. not waterproof.
3. Battery life is great and the four additional charges you can have on your docking case allows even more prolonged use. Quick 45 minute charge gave me 4-5 hrs of music playtime. (haven't tested out calltime)
4. Personal pet peeve of mine but the low battery announcement isn't rushed (good five minutes before device actually powers off from no more battery life)
5. Call quality is fantastic and people on the receiving end of the line never complained about not being able to hear me when I am talking.
6. Magnetic ends on the buds allow for more convenient access to the charging dock - no need to fit them inside like a puzzle piece.
7. Answer/Reject Calls function is neat and announces the phone number of who's calling.

Cons:
1. Even with the optimal silicone bud size for my ears, they do tend to fall out of your ear every now and then. Especially for me, it was when walking down stairs and rigorous sprinting.
2. No playback function or volume function.. have to adjust volume or next/prev track on connected bluetooth device.
3. Another small pet peeve of mine but if you do decide to use one bud at a time, there will be four to five intermittent  beeps until the opposing bud is paired as well. Not a huge dealbreaker though - it becomes more bearable as time passes lol.

TLDR
Sure you can go with Bose/Beats/Jabras etc but why spend that extra cash when there are gems like these that are more than capable and satisfactory. Maybe time will truly tell whether if these buds will last as long but for people looking to make a quick (less guilty) purchase - you won't regret these.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
100% worth the money.,"Right out of the box, these headphones are fantastic. The sound is very clear and clean and sound delay is very minimal. Usage is super intuitive, the headphones turn on automatically when they're taken out of the charging case and automatically pair to each other and go into pairing mode for the mobile device (or whatever you're using) to connect. They fit perfectly in the ear and the buttons are easy to press with fairly easy to remember controls. All around a great pair of headphones and significantly better than any I've had in the past 3 years.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Might be bigger than you think, but they’re great!","I work in landscaping and I consistently used the Apple EarBuds (wired) every day at work. But then I’d drop my phone and the plugs would bend, or the cable would snap, or my cat would simply chew threw it. My friend recommended I get AirPods like he had but I wasn’t about to spend $120 on what, in my opinion, were mediocre headphones that don’t even block out sound (I.E.: rubber nubs). I bought these, not expecting the sound quality to be nearly as good as they are and even with BassBooster on my iPhone there is no crackle. Outside sound is extremely muffled, which is great for when I’m operating machinery. I can hear without turning my volume all the way up too (even over the machinery)

My only issue with these (if you want to call it an issue) is that they were a bit larger than I expected. Not HUGE, but a bit bulky. Otherwise, great headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great customer service. They take care of you,A quality product and a good value. The sound quality is great.

Great sounding Wireless Ear Buds,"Does not sound like the earlier wireless headphones or ear buds. These sound solid with great base, mids and treble.  Could use a bit more treble; however, for the price and Wireless option, pretty amazing. I even compared next to an over ear set of Parrot headphones and JBL wired ear buds. I'd use the Tozo ear buds as a preference now and I'm not even thinking about the waterproof part...but I know it will come in handy as well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for the gym,"This is my first pair of totally wireless earbuds for the gym. I couldn't recommend them any more highly. They've never fallen out of my ears during workouts. No more wires of any sort to get caught in a weight. And best of all the batteries have never once run out during my workouts. I can be in the gym upwards of 2.5 hours and the headphones still have plenty of battery left when I'm done.

I enjoy the charging case as well. It's great to be able to keep them charged on the go.

As for the sound, everything is clear. I'm a musician so this is big for me. The bass especially comes through without being too loud. Noise cancellation is the only thing lacking. I can often hear the gym's music blasting coming through what I'm listening to on the headphones. However it's easy to hear people ask if they can work in or how many sets I have left, so that's a big plus.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds.,"Great set of earbuds. At first, they didn't fit quite right but they provide a few options for the ear cups and I found one that fits really well.

Occasionally cuts out. But ok,I bought these to work out and jog with. Without the jangling of a corded earbud. They don't fall out easily so that's good. Sound quality is good. It does the job. My problem with these is that I can hold one in my clenched fist and they will disconnect. Sometimes when im walking with my phone in my pocket the connection cuts. But besides that they are ok.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Needs improvement,"I was really excited when i received this, the earbuds look pretty cool and the case as well but the left ear piece started to have connections issues in just a few days, I returned it and got a new pair.
CONS:
1- Once it reaches low battery which is around 20% or so it starts to beep too frequent to even be able to use it for the remaining time
2- once you pick it up one ear piece from the case it is supposed to connect to the other one but if you only want to use one lets say the right one, it will beep constantly trying to connect to the left one which is really annoying
3- if there is anything in between the earbuds and the device you are connected to it loses connection pretty easy for example: if you are listening to an audio book and tilt your head and support it with your hand in a resting position and your hand cover the ear piece it would actually cut the connection with device for a few seconds.

PROS
1- Good looking design
2- case looks well built
3- audio quality is decent
4- battery life is decent
5- the wireless charging is very convenience ( wireless charger sold separately)",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great seller - Updated,"Wow, I gotta say, the seller is committed to happy customers!
I submitted the review below, and the seller reached out, asking what they could do to make me happy.  They offered to send me a different pair, so I took them up on it.  Again, to be clear, the sound in the original pair was impressive, especially for the price-point, but I was disappointed in the top volume.
Well, the new pair arrived this weekend, and rather than the same model, I was sent the Tozo T6 model.  Very similar sound, but one key difference... the T6 has an internal volume control in addition to being able to control volume from your phone (or other bluetooth device).  The net result is more volume control, and more volume.  (The carrying case/charger is a bit smaller, too).

Original Review:
The build quality seems pretty good, and the sound quality is above-average.... except for the volume. My hearing is fine, and I'm comparing these against several other pairs of headphones (both wired and wireless). I do like to listen to music on the louder side now and then, and these come up short at those times. Comparing them against other wireless headphones, I would say the volume maxes out at around 2/3rds of what is typical. If you're only going to be listening to these in a quiet environment, or you never turn your volume up past half-way, then the quality of the sound and build makes these a good buy for the price.
But if you like it on the louder side, keep looking.
The seller did offer a free wireless charging pad in exchange for a high review, but I didn't need one.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Sound and Easy to Pair,"I switched to these for my workouts because my over-the-ear headphones were not great to wear in Arizona in the summer. The earbuds came with 4 sets of buds to ensure they will fit in anyone's ears. I wear them during my 4-mile walk and they never fell out. If you don't want to spend money on over-priced Apple buds, these are perfect for you.

Great for the price. Super bass!! d@@b,"First off for the price you can’t go wrong. I’ve herd sound from buds that cost twice as much and the bass on these are ridiculous! The connectivity is quick and easy and they haven’t cut out or anything as of now (had them for almost I week). I use them while doing housework outside in south Florida heat and the sweat doesn’t make them wiggle out. I also longboard around the neighborhood and they stayed in. Make sure you fit the correct size gel ear piece or they will fall out. Though I have to say getting the gel piece on was a challenge, have big fingers. Call quality was great! I herd them fine, and they herd me like I was holding the phone. So all in all for less than $50 I have no complaints. They even give you an extended 1year warranty on them.

Excellent Product! Excellent Price!,These earbuds are amazing. Automatically pairs and comes on when you take them out of the charger.

Best earbuds I have ever owned. Would buy again and with Christmas coming they would make excellent gifts.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Decent,"These are a nice set for those with budget in mind. The sound quality is good for the price, although the bass they claim to have is very sloppy and takes away from the sound quality. The controls are terrible as they are click buttons rather than touch surfaces. You pretty much pop your ear drum if you try to press the bud button. The commands don't really make sense either (2 clicks makes your phone call back the last number you were in contact with). The comfort is pretty standard for an in-ear bud. Multiple spelling/grammar errors in the user manual makes you think you bought something fake.
Overall, my discontinued $60 Samsung Gear wireless headset from 4 years ago is still better today.
The numerous amazing reviews are pretty misleading. As someone with an ear for quality, I will be returning these and giving the Echo buds or Galaxy buds a shot at $130",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Quality,"I purchased two of these units. They paired easily to the first device. The second device needed the first to be out of range or off. So they are each now paired and work well with either equally well. Charging is quick and done easily enough via cable or on a wireless charging pad. I have not been able to determine long term battery life but updated battery status is indicated in the devices Bluetooth indications. The sound quality has been great.

Great Quality at Affordable Price,"I needed to get some wireless ear buds because the wired ones were getting in my way at work.  I did some research and the Tozo T10's had some good reviews and at a price between $40 and $50, I thought I would give them a try.  The battery life is good on these, they are definitely noise cancelling as I can't hear anything when I have both buds in and the sound is good quality.  Never having had true wireless, I didn't realize you had to have both buds close together or the connection gets crackly (I only keep one bud in at work because I need to hear if there is a co-worker behind me or someone asking me a question).  That took me a minute to realize but definitely not an issue.  I would highly recommend these ear buds as the quality of the build and sound are very good. Can't beat the price for the quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Earbuds hold a good charge and sound great.,"I mainly bought this so I can listen to podcasts and music while working. The earbuds work as intended. When you take them out of the case they turn on. You can use the left or right separately or they can link together. If you do intend to use them separately make sure you pair both of them and not just the right. They also turn off as soon as you put them back into the case. The case also holds a pretty good charge so I don’t worry about the earbuds dying.

The only downside is that the left earbuds keeps falling out of my ear. So I probably need to switch to a smaller rubber piece or it could be a problem with my ear.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sounds great. Hate the case.,"Looking for a pair of WHITE wireless earbuds. This seems to fit the bill, but while this pair sounds great, the case is just too big! No USB type C.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for the price.,"This item arrived as described.  Was neatly packaged and arrived quickly. I had a few wireless earbuds and this one for the price and quality, it is on par or better than some of the earbuds I had that are same price or higher.

Sound quality is surprisingly good.  Has a nice deep bass so great for workout type of music.  If your music player have equalizer, you can tone down the bass if it becomes too much.  For me it is perfect with the punchy bass since I use it mainly for workout.

I thought the earbud would not stay.  If you follow the direction and twist it, it does stay securely.  I had to adjust a few times when it becomes loss, but that's not an issue for me.

It is super comfortable.  At times I forget I was wearing it.  Light weight and not as bulky where it'll stick out.

Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and will recommend to anyone wanting a decent pair of wireless earbuds for a reasonable price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Solid product, great customer service","Had purchased these earbuds previously and although they sound good, the quality on the calls weren't so hot.  Customer service replace them and the new pair are much better.  Good call quality and good music.  For the price this is a great set of buds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I'm all about the bass.,Had these for a few days now and so far they are fantastic for the price. Definitely the best sound i have ever had from earbuds. I have tried several Motorola and LG in the past and the have the best bass I've heard. Battery life is good so far and the fit with the provided adapters is spot on. Hope they hold up because right now i love them.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Quality & Sound,"I wasn't looking to spend $200 on a pair of headphones. So I did some searching on Amazon and came across these TOZO Bluetooth wireless headphones and I am so glad I did! Pairs very easy, great noise cancelling, and fantastic sound quality. You do not have to worry about them falling out of your ear! I use them for working out, taking phone calls, and listening to music at work. Great product at great cost!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Finally, a good pair","This is the 4th pair of earbuds I have tried.  So far, I am totally happy with thes.  The ease of setup is very important to me.  They paired with one another and then to my phone.  They are simple to use and the sound quality is very nice.

Thank you - I am enjoying these buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They fit in small ears,"So far they’re great! They actually stay in my tiny ears. I’ve never been able to use apple earbuds because they’re too big and hard painful plastic. These stay in very well. They slip out a little bit with sweat, but I think that’s pretty unavoidable. I used them all day yesterday and the battery was still charged, and the sound quality was very good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Smaller sizes please,"SO big and awkward looking. I bought these to work out with and just went back to my regular headphones. I'm honestly embarrassed to wear these out in public with how they stick out of my ears.

Left ear bud constantly cuts out,"Decent sound and connectivity but the left ear bud constantly cuts out with random events:  phone in your pocket, turning your head too suddenly, etc.  Customer support for the product is lacking - they simply give you several steps to reset the ear buds and when these don't work they advise you to contact Amazon for more support.  Once you purchase the product the company begins sending you e-mails soliciting you to leave a good review in exchange for another charging case or wireless charger.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Even Better,"I upgraded from the T8. They sound better and last longer.
These also support wireless charging which is awesome. For some reason they sync up with my phone faster & better than the T8's also.

I haven't attempted to use these in the pool yet but the manual says you can use them in the pool (only not to submerge your head under water)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great pair of fairly price bluetooth earbuds,"Would definitely recommend. The sound quality is precise, especially given the price of the earbuds (with significant bass amplification for people who want that). They fit well in my ears, connect to my phone over bluetooth conveniently, and have a significant range. The charging case is also a cool feature and can fit in your pocket. Earbuds are great for working out. On top of that, customer service is very helpful as well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set for the money amazing sound!,The fit is perfect and the light weight makes them stay put even when active. The sound quality is impressive. I have other high end brands and these are just as good as pairs I paid over $200 for. The case holds them really well with magnets and is sturdy as well. The case only charges them fully once and partial the second time but I can't complain. Distance is great I can be across the apartment and the Bluetooth stays connected.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Product,"The earbuds were everything that I expected. The way they fit in your ear blocks out the sound around you.

I use them in the gym and in the shower.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
$100 wireless earbuds for $50,"I had been using Jaybirds for years and wanted to try a truly wireless pair of earbuds. The last Jaybirds I owned was the x2 so that's my comparison. I bought my Jaybirds when they were around $100.

The range is a bit further than the Jaybirds, and the sound quality is similar. I think bass is a bit lacking but I didn't really notice it after a few uses. It's very ""plug and play"" and does everything I expect. On the first few uses, the left side sometimes very briefly disconnects from the right. However, it still doesn't seem to be anything that interrupts my use.

I wish I could adjust the volume from the earbuds and 3 hours isn't as long as my other earbuds but otherwise, it's a great purchase for $50. It's been a week. If it lasts a year then it's fantastic. For now, I'm a very satisfied customer.

Also, the charging case is an awesome feature to upgrade to from the Jaybirds, which helps a bit for the short battery span.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The Best Affordable Wireless Earbuds,"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality earbuds for the price point...,"I bought these because my old Samsung S7 is starting to get old and the headphone jack is start to wear out.

These have thumping base and loud sounds. Clarity is good. Loud though only head phones I have to turn down to 70% volume. It was made with alot of bass in mind.

I have made phone calls with it. This one was what I was worried about. But to my surprise... it was clear and my family said it was not echoy or I didnt sound muffled... The Trick to this is USED BOTH earbuds to sound crystal clear ...

Overall pretty good quality for its price point. I would purchase these again... Shoot I might even give these out for xmas presents.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good alternative to high end bluetooth headphones.,"So far so good.  The sound quality is good.  Good bass.  Cancels outside noise pretty good too.  The design is good.  The case is nice. Wasn't sure how I was going to feel with a seemingly bulky earpiece in my ear. Once it's in, I barely notice it's in there. Plus they stay in during workouts.

When I wear corded headphones, the tend to make me ear tender. As of now I haven't had that issue with these headphones.

So far battery life has been good.  Good to have the case give you extra charges if your out as well.

Only thing I don't like is your not able to adjust volume with the earpieces.

Other than that,  I'm liking these so far.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to try bluetooth headphones but now wanting to dish out $100+.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible Value!,"After continuous use the last 4 months I’ve been very impressed with this product. No it won’t win any Apple style points but it’s been dependable and easy to use across many devices.
PROS:  Easy set-up, pairing, comfortable fit, good sound quality, more than decent battery life
CONS: Charging case is a little bulky but not a big issue (mainly when you try and pocket it)  The mini USB charging port can be hard to plug into (but not a huge issue)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Quality For The Price,"I was told by multiple sales representatives at phone companies that the only way to go is to match my iphone with Apple Air Pods. However, i couldnt see myself paying $200 for a pair of small headphones. Tozo proved them wrong. I was a bit skeptical about the purchase. Once I received them I was satisfied with the instructions and %75 battery life out of the box. Upon testing them out for the first time in the office, the headphones worked great for business calls. Later that day i took them to the real test. THE GYM. The headphones worked great and had solid noise cancellation. one of the earbuds fell out but i replaced the earpiece with a larger one provided in the box. Havent had a problem since. I will be buying multiple sets for christmas this year. I feel like my family will enjoy them as well and it wont break the bank! I give this a five star shopping experience.

Good quality earbuds for a great price,"These earbuds were a good buy. The sound quality is overall very good and the bass is exceptional for such a small footprint. You can use both earbuds or a single earbud at a time, which is super convenient in the office environment. One area that may be a concern is that the noise cancelling and even the environment noise blocking of these earbuds makes it extremely difficult to hear things around you. That is why in the office I use one earbud.  When i just want to fade away and chill that same characteristic is amazing!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wonderful Product- Great Customer Service,"I purchased this product as an alternative to the more expensive Apple Air Pods.  I had tried several “generic” AirPods and had frequent sound quality issues, range issues, etc.  I also liked the fact that these earbuds are waterproof—though I have not had the opportunity to use them while swimming yet.  THe sound quality, charging case (which also charges wirelessly on any wireless charging mat) and earphone are excellent.  I did have a rare problem with the left earbud battery failure, but customer service was prompt and eager to solve the issue.  They come with a one year no-hassle warranty and they mean what they say.  I appreciate all the help and enjoy using these earbuds.  I recommend highly recommend the product.  I did mark down noise cancellation to 4 stars, but earbuds inherently do not have the same ability to noise cancel as over-the-ear headphones.  I have three young children, so noise cancellation can be a huge feature when I am trying to work from home.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Compact case perfect for everyday commuter headphones,"These headphones are perfect for my daily casual usage on the train.

If you turned your head..cut out..walked 5 feet from my iPhone..cut out..moved my body a couple of inches..cut out..did nothing..cut out. I knew these were to good to be true.

They stand by their product!,"UPDATE - TOZO reached out and sent me a replacement pair that works as its supposed to. The company stands by their product, which I respect.

Original review below

They fit comfortably and they sound good—when they work. The left ear cuts in and out all the time with just regular use, such as biking, walking around the neighborhood, or at the gym. It's pretty frustrating. I've reset them multiple times, but still have trouble with the left one cutting in and out.

Update.,"When I originally bought these I returned them due to connectivity issues and thought nothing of it after I left my review. About a week later I received another pair from the vendor even though my money was refunded and I did not ask for a replacement. I’ve tested the new pair for about four weeks and have not had one issue with connectivity at all. As I suspected the original pair I received just happen to be a bad pair. I would highly recommend these buds. For the price point the sound quality is good, battery life is good and customer service is great.

The earbuds go out of  power in the afternoon even after I charged the whole night.  Later I saw other people's review, I realize it might be the connection problem.

I am Apple person from the very beginning, but when I saw my husband’s Apple wireless Airpods, I thought he looked like an alien!🤪. I have found my TOZO earbuds easy to pair to each other and to link to my iPhone and iPod.  The enclosed instructions were clear and understandable.  The wireless feature is important for me,  as I use these earbuds while I am knitting and there are no wires to to get tangled with the yarn.  I also like the wireless feature when I walk outside or am doing household chores.  I listen to my own music from Pandora, my subscription radio shows both live and in a podcast format as well as to the audio books that I listen to from the Audible App.  I do not plan on testing them them in the water, nor can I comment on noise cancellation.

Best Cheap Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds on Amazon,"Edit 9/27/2019: I used the earbuds for a little more than a week and one got this distorted sound and half the time wouldn't turn on. I got a replacement through amazon and used it for a little more than two weeks when the right earbud stopped charging in the charging case all together unless you held it down at the right angle. I contacted TOZO and they sent a replacement in just 2 days, however sadly on arrival the right earbud once again wouldn't charge and I was stuck with two sets of broken earbuds. I wanted to love these earbuds and i'm sure if I contacted the company they would give me another replacement as their customer service seems great. I decided however, to go with a different brand around the same price and have had no problems.

The TOZO T10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds are the best I've tried out of many other products at this price range. The IPX8 waterproofing, sound quality, connection, and charging case features all make these earbuds the best for me.

IPX8 Waterproofing: This was the most important feature to me, as I spend a lot of time around water and like to listen to music or podcasts while I am. Most of the wireless earbuds at this price are IPX5-7 and although this is alright, it's not good enough to not worry about water at all. With the TOZO T10's I have not worried about water once. I have used these in the shower, in the rain, and by the pool(not inside the pool) and have had no problem with a difference in sound quality while they are wet.

Sound Quality: When the product says deep bass, it means it. The bass on these earphones is very deep and sounds amazingly good with music, I believe it might be just a bit too much bass for voices on podcasts or videos but it's not enough to be a problem and I find the sound quality to be the best I've heard on a pair of wireless earphones. Surprisingly to me, even better than the Samsung Galaxy Buds I also own and they are $130 instead of $50.

Connection: The connection with these earbuds actually is within 10 seconds. Obviously it will never be as fast as plugging in a wire but the earbud first searches for the second earbud and then both connect to the device automatically after the first pairing all with sound promps to tell you when its connected. Losing connection never happens unless I go too far away from the device.

Quality of Earbuds/Charging case: The earphones last about 3-3.5 hours and the charging case gives them a couple extra charges as it should. The charging case charges very fast when it needs it. The quality of both of charging case and earbuds is fantastic, the magnets for the lid on the charging case are very strong and do their job. I have had no problems putting the earbuds into the case to charge.

Fit: The earbuds fit very well in my ears and even stay in my ears when wet in the shower or rain, I have not had a earbud fall out of my ear once even with good use. I did have to go a size up on the buds and this was easy as they provide 3 different sizes and one different color(black instead of black and red) for the buds.

Conclusion: These earbuds have 4.3 stars out of 7000 reviews for a reason, they are very good for their price and at least to me seem to have zero problems and only good features. If you want cheap wireless earbuds with great waterproofing and sound quality with no other bad features, the TOZO T10's have done everything right and you should get them, even if you feel worried about it from other brands wireless earbuds. I own the more expensive Samsung Galaxy Buds as well and the TOZO T10's win for sure.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I was really surprised to find out that these would be better then the over the ear headphones I ordered. I use these things all day every day. The bass amazed me like it punches good.

Awesome earbuds!,"Sound quality, noise cancelation, and ear fitting is great! The only thing about these earbuds is pairing can get confusing. JUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS ! When you initially get them and pair them for the first time the device you are using will try and pair the buds separately, don't try and pair separate. Take both buds out and and let the right earbud pair with left earbud. This might take 30 secs. Once the the earbuds are paired  then you will only see the right earbud as a selection to pair with your device. Pair the right earbud to your device and even though your device shows only right is paired both earbuds will work.  If it fails the first time its okay. Delete the earbuds from your device and try it again. I had to attempt it twice and now they work perfect!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The Perfect Earbuds,"These earbuds are amazing! I was one of those people so accustomed to wire headphones and was hesitant to switch to Bluetooth but I decided to make the jump and so happy I did! They are very comfortable, don’t fall out of your ears, and the sound quality is great. That is one of the most important things to me and these do not disappoint- they have awesome bass. I also love that they come in a compact, sleek container so they don’t get lost and are charged through there. The battery lasts a long time and the setup is very easy. Can’t say enough great things about these. I have been recommending them to everyone!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very bass heavy sound (good overall) but ergonomics are so so,"The sound from these, when fitted with the proper ear gels is very isolating and emphasizes the low end. This is preferred, imo, overall to headphones that are too flat in sound. When outdoors and commuting bass does not get lost and the outside world does not intrude uneccesarily. Top marks for sound quality!

Othewise, the ergonomics on these are questionable. The left and right earpieces are exactly the same shape. This means instead of ""tucking in"" next to your ears when they are inserted, they stick out. For me, this seems like a cost-cutting measure. This makes them more likely to fall out because they don't rest on your ear cartilage as much and, for what it's worth, look more nerdy.

This set also takes a while to auto pair with my phone after removal from the case. It goes into pairing mode automatically and takes about 15 seconds before it's ready to go. Seems too long to me. The Galaxy buds I tried take far less time. The charging case could also be a tad bit smaller.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
BEST EARBUDS EVER!!!!,"I am also one of those people that doesn’t like the apple AirPods and was looking at different products. And then I came across this and saw the reviews and decided to go for it. Not only does this product blow away the apple stuff, and it’s a much better price. The quality is excellent! Fits in my perfectly and totally drains out noise. The bass response is also incredible which I was not expecting for this price. I can literally tune out the world watching my favorite show or movie. And the sound is amazing! I am so happy with these wireless earbuds and the price awesome! If you’re looking for a replacement for the apple stuff this not only the best choice, but the only one!!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
worked once,"The first time i got it, it worked great... the second, third, forth and so on times i tried to get it to freaking pair to itself or my phone. It would no work.

Disappointed,"They don’t stay in my ears very well, they fall out easily. That makes me fear I might lose one. I’ve had them for 3weeks.

Impressed,"I had a pair of apple air pods and lost one. I didn’t want to pay 150$ for another pair , so I found these on amazon. They arrived much quicker than predicted.  They connected to blue tooth quickly. Sound quality is clearer than my old air pods which had no noise cancellation.  Very comfortable, maybe slightly loose, but fit better than air pods",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great gift!,My husband is a headphone snob & so we go through ALOT of different devices & gadgets for him. These are a winner in his book! He wears them when he mows the lawn & the noise cancellation is awesome!!! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very nice!,I love these ear buds. I had a hard time getting them paired with my phone but after a few tries I did the hard reset (held button on both buds until purple light flashed 3x). They paired with ease after that. I like that they come with different sizes because I switched to the smaller bud covers. Still getting use to putting them in for a snug fit so they don't fall out but sound quality is great. I even answered a call without difficulty and they didn't complain about not being able to hear me. The only thing I didn't like was the sound switched from ear to ear when the other person talked at times. I like that it comes with the charging/storage case. Love these and can't wait to take them on my trip. Highly recommend these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Buds I've had in awhile,"I love these earbuds. I've tried several ear buds over time and I've found that most are lacking in some major way. These are the exception. I've only used these buds a few times so far, but I find I love the super deep bass and the fit of the buds. Changing the rubber tips to a smaller size to fit my ears was easy. The sounds for this price range is exceptional and well worth the monies. Thinking very seriously about buying another pair for my wife. She tried them and loved them as well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Headphones I've gotten to date,"At first I was a bit skeptical buying headphones like these, because just dropping one side of it and losing it was a fear of mine, and would certainly warrant a lot of ""F's"" in the chat.

After getting these though, the sound quality, how comfortable it fits in my ears, and the battery life on the headphones themselves, and then there's the price: I'm just gonna say that these are worth the purchase, and I have a feeling these will last me quite a while. I've also gathered (from reading other reviews) that the customer reviews are pretty solid in their own right, so that took care of my earlier concern.

So, if you're considering it, my advice is, as a famous guy once said, ""JUST DO IT"".",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

WoW,"I was skeptical at first having delt with some lemons in the past but as soon as I removed the buds from the dock they paired. Connected them to my iPhone with no hassle. Picked my favorite Volbeat song and bam! The difference was night and day to the ones I've been using for the past 3 years. The volume a tad lower than my older ones which concerns me a bit but won't know till Monday how they hold up at the factory where I work but so far I'm digging them. My old ones last 2 hrs at full volume so I'm hoping I get simular battery life as that's a deal breaker for me. I have two that I alternate between breaks but if this charging box holds true it will be a blessing as I only intend to use one bud per 2 hrs. Love the look, seem quality, sound good so fingers crossed they work out for my purpose.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones!,Great product. I like that they are Waterproof and that can be Used one or both and while they are labeled right and left put them in whichever ear you want as they are the same shape. Wireless charging is quiet convenient as I already wirelessly charge my phone and can now just use the same pad to charge the case which charges the headphones. So far I am very much enjoying them and look forward to much more use!Only issue I’ve had is that it  Sometimes disconnects but quickly reconnects.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, super comfortable and sweat proof!","I got these to replace MPow Flame earbuds.  Sound quality is great - I'm really pleased given the price point - deep, full sound with excellent bass for podcasts and rock/pop.  Battery life is around 4 hours...but even when I listen for long periods of time, I usually take short brakes,and by placing the buds back in the case they charge quickly without having to plug the case in, which is very convenient and helps extend battery life.  Workouts and sweat proofing - I sweat a lot.  I've historically used buds with ear hooks so that they stay in place during workouts, but the cord was always annoying as it tended to pull on one of the buds.  After several weeks, these have been great against resisting sweat.  The only thing that I would improve upon would be to include the large foam ear tips (see photo) with the earbuds.  For my ears, even with the largest of the rubber tips, the earbuds tended to fall out when my ears were sweaty, which is similar to my experience with other earbuds.  Once I swapped to the foam tips, I got a better seal that no longer falls out when at maximum sweat.  If you are looking for earbuds for running/workouts, these are the way to go!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
You get what you pay for,"The quality of sound on these buds is actually very impressive. After my beats wireless buds went bad I decided to get a cheaper set and these outperform the Beats earbuds on sound quality as well as volume. The major problem with these buds is the battery life. The description says you can get up to 7 hours of life on these things, but I have personally never gotten any more than 3 hours of life out of them. Also, the charger only charges them about two times on a full charge. Definitely disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound quality!,"I use headphones to work out and hike 3-4 times a week, and I have 40% hearing loss in both ears.  So I’m sensitive to sound quality as it greatly improves my experience when listening to music.  Often as I turn the sound up to listen easily, poor sound quality becomes very apparent. These earbuds fit comfortably and securely and provide great sound.  Especially for the price!  I was using BeatsX headphones before and these are much better (and MUCH less expensive).  I like the waterproof aspect as well.  I was hiking recently and got caught in the rain, and I didn’t have to worry.  Well I did worry, but they had no problems.  So, now I can relax.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound at a Great Price,I'm a work out junkie and I bought these headphones for the gym.  They feel great once I settled on the right ear piece and the sound is phenomenal the range is a bit short but for the most part I can leave my phone in my gym bag and still hear the my music.  Overall I would recommend these every bit as good as the competition but so much lower in price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not as reviews described... Really disappointed,"Not impressed, I stream music all day at work. The battery barely lasted 3 hours. I prefer to wear only one ear bud because I'm at work and need to hear others as I'm needed. The right one called the master lost battery life and can't use the left without the right unless the right isn't in the charging case. The left is called the slave by the way which really didn't sit right with me at all. Also barely even able to leave my office and the earbuds disconnect. I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase and will be returning them. Not sure where all the good reviews came from '_cause that wasn't my experience. Gonna be even more disappointed if I will be charged return shipping from my refund",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Value and Functionality,"I just needed some wireless buds for the gym but didn't want to be break the bank. The TOZO T10 have been a surprise in all regards. Out of box pairing is  easy, the buds fit quite snugly (YMMV, though they offer multiple size tips) and provide decent noise cancellation. I'm no audiophile but the buds also have surprisingly powerful bass drivers and pretty good overall sound. I am looking forward to putting the buds through their paces, haven't really tested the waterproof abilities, but light sweating has been no issue. The charge case and quick charge abilities make them perfect for short stints like trips to the gym or hikes. Also comes with 1 year manufacturer's warranty.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Earbuds in both performance and value,"I picked up a pair of these wireless earbuds as my 2nd dip into the crowded pool of wireless earbuds.  I previously used another brands wireless earphones, the kind with the cable between the two earbuds, and then bluetooth to the phone.  They worked great for almost 2 years, and only recently started to not hold a charge anymore.  I think i paid $20 for them on a Lightning deal, so i call that a win.  So when it came time to buy a replacement, i started doing some research online.  I landed on another brands earbuds, one could say maybe a more well known brand.  I bought them direct from the brands site.  When i received them all seemed great, good fit and finish, but when i started using them in the gym they kept dropping connection from the left and right earbud.  I followed all the instructions from there help forums and all that, no luck.  So after many resets, re pairs, and firmware updates i gave up and sent them back.  As soon as i did that i did some more digging and came across these TOZO earbuds.  First off, i had no idea who TOZO was, as there seems to be a million companies making similar earbuds, with all sorts of claims.  But, i was in need of some earbuds, and the price was good, and the reviews looked solid.  So i ordered them up, knowing if they did not work, i could just return them via Amazon.  Well, to my surprise, they work amazing.  They worked right out of the box, super easy pairing, build quality seems great for the price.  Sound quality is actually really good.  I can not really comment on battery life, but they have not needed to be charged in over a weeks of daily use, but that is also the case charging them.  These little guys are a great value, you are not paying for a name and marketing.  Give them a shot, i am pretty sure you will like them, and if you don't, return them and find one that does .",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Well worth it,"Sound quality is great, fits relatively well in my ear hoodies will eventually knock out the headphones. Haven't tested headphones in water but have worn in a rainstorm still work well. A bit wierd when only trying to use only one headphone must wait till search for is done to stop beeping. All in all for the month plus that i have been using the Tozo T10 worth every penny",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless charging is why I got these,"These are great headphones.  What I've noticed is that while in their charge case, not being used, if the battery level of the case falls below a level that will charge the buds, they will connect to your paired BT device without being removed from the case.  You wouldn't notice this unless your were looking at your phone to see the headphone symbol appear in the status bar.  You might notice if you were listening to an audio source but if you didn't, the headphone batteries would drain to zero.  So you must be mindful of the case charge level as well as the bud charge to get the most out of these.  I will say that TOZO the company has been great when I've not been completely satisfied with one of their products and replaced it or refunded my purchase price at my option.  I love the wireless charge case, I don't like how these buds will connect without being removed from the case.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Bass is certainly important according to my teenage son who doesnt know I got these for a good deal....hes one of those teens who thinks name brand is always best..lol. yes true to some extent  but for these.

"Not for me, at least.","Doesn't fit well in my ear at all. I've tried all of the different rubber inserts, but none of them fit well. Not only that, its very uncomfortable, even hurts at times. Once I place them in, they just start sliding out immediately. To fix this, I have to really jam them into my ear, twisting them in. Just not happy with it.

Sound quality seems fine, but leaving it in my ears for more than a few minutes becomes really uncomfortable and taking them out is not relieving. It's very jarring taking them out. Also, the buttons on the side are incredibly difficult to press, a serious pain. Not a fan.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Loving my Tozos !!,"Ive had them not quite a full week yet. They take a little getting used to. I find that I want to readjust them in my ears often but I think that comes from me being afraid of them falling out... They never do, I'm just anxious. I think sound cancellation may depend on your ear hole size and shape. There have been instances where I thought the noise cancellation was awful but I think it was just douchebags being loud at the gym and not so much the earbuds themselves - maybe a little bit tho. So far I love them. They are quite useful in the gym - weight lifting, yoga, handstanding, running, dancing, all of that! They never fall out. They stay out of my way which is exactly what I wanted. I was using an LG Tone neck band before and it just got annoying. I think they're definitely worth the money and they come with a 1 year warranty! also the hands free call aspect is wonderrrrfulllll. over all I love this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Color Me Impressed,"Ok I have been looking for weeks on Amazon for a good pair of affordable True Wireless Earbuds and originally had purchased the Sandoo Earbuds. When the Sandoo earbuds came in I was so excited, but that excited lasted about half a day because the ear buds would cut in and out if you even thought of touching them and they sounded terrible as well. The Sandoo earbuds were $10 less than the Tozo Earbuds, but they were recommended by Amazon so I decided why not buy them to have one more shot at finding a good pair of true wireless earbuds before I gave up. The Tozo earbuds showed up at my house and I couldn't wait to open them up to see if they actually worked as advertised and omg WOW WOW WOW!!! They most certainly do what they promised and sound amazing. From the packaging to the actual product itself I am literally amazed. I mean only Apple has a system like that where the packaging is just as nice as the product and Tozo you are knocking things out of the park. How do Apple Earpods cost so much when the Tozo earbuds sounds just brilliant. The bass is awesome, the mods are awesome and the highs are awesome and not to mention I use these while working out in my garden and then come inside and jump right into the shower with the ear buds still on never missing a beat. I will recommend your products to anyone I know looking for things that y'all sell. Thank you so much for making this skeptical man a happy man.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Compared with another wireless earbud I previous used, TaoTronics TT-BH026 https://amzn.com/gp/product/B074QKS8RK, TOZO T10 outperforms on the Bluetooth link speed, and the battery life.

TOZO T10 usually took less than 2 seconds to get connected to my devices. And last times I used it for 4 hours, the battery life still had 70%.

One pitfall I found is that the earbud will not turn off automatically when putting back to the charging case. I have to manually turned it off by holding the button for few seconds.

Absolute garbage,"I'm really not sure how these earbuds managed to acquire a four star rating. The sound quality is mediocre at best. The soundstage is flat and sounds like you are under water. The bass it definitely lacking in these, as well. Trying to get them to connect to my LG V30 is a chore. I have to manually attempt to get them to connect each time I take them out of the case. This process usually takes about a minute or two before both earpods are actually connected. Usually only one connects and I have to press the power button on the second eaerbud and hope it connects. Starting today the right earbud is failing to stay connected so I'm only getting audio out of the last earbud. Needless to say these are pretty worthless. I paid $28 for these which was way too much.

But I think the most frustrating thing is I have to re-pair it every time I use it. It doesn't automatically connect like all my other ones. The last thing is the battery doesn't last.

Awesome Product,"I have always been skeptical about using wireless earbuds but these earbuds totally changed my mind. In the past I have use earbuds where the sound quality was bad or would even lose signal despite the phone and earbud being close to one another. I have also had ear buds where the mic did not pick up my voice well. All of these concerns were resolved with the TOZO T10. I have had the ear buds for about one week since the writing of this review and I have nothing to say but praise so I will just mention points that are important to me.

First, the sound quality is very good. I use the earbuds for music and calls and the sound has always been clear. The earbuds also produce a surprising amount of bass which I would say is comparable to what you would get from wired ear buds/phones. I also like that you have the option of using one or both wireless ear buds and the sound quality does not suffer.

Second, the mic picks up my voice very well. In fact, people that I have called had said they even hear my background noise.

Lastly, the batter life is surprisingly good. There was a day where i used the earbuds non-stop for about 4 hours straight for music before I got the warning that the battery was low. Afterwards, I put the buds in the charging case and they re-charged very quickly.

If I really had to complain though... it would be that the earbuds are really good at blocking out noise. In the box, there are additional ear pieces so you can select the size that best fits you and the one I selected fitted me very well to the point where I almost missed the train because I barely heard it pull up.

All in all, I think TOZO made a very good product and I will most likely recommend or even gift a set of these ear buds to a friend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I'm mesmerized, with just the press of the right side of the Tozo T10 earbud I can answer calls (call quality is awesome), pause my music and resume and for me, this is priceless.  I love the easiness to pair with my phone and the wireless charge box aspect, it really sets it apart from other brands, The case the earbuds stay in is genius! Not only does it keep them safe but it charges them too! Simply charge up the case using the USB cable and then the case can charge your earbuds on the go, which is amazing for traveling! Overall, I'm so happy that I chose the Tozo's with the sound quality, the battery life, and general looks, you can't go wrong, You can thank me later!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound/nice fit,"Sound quality and fit are excellent.

Nice compact design and charging case is not to wonky.  Longer charge life would be helpful as they lasted about 3.5 hours on the plane but that is what is stated in the product specifications.

I took a couple of phone calls on it and the voice was very clear on my end and people could hear me clearly on the receiving.  That was a plus as I wasn't planning on using them for phone calls but it would appear that I can with confidence.  I have not tested yet to see how they perform at places like airports where background noise is significant",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless charging doesn’t charge. Microphone picks up a lot of background noise.,"Wireless charging doesn’t actually work at all. The lights go on but nothing actually happens beyond that. I’ve been told that they pick up background noise when in phone calls.

If just using them as headphones they’re pretty good. For $50 the wireless charging was like a bonus to me so I wasn’t entirely butthurt about it not working, inconvenient mostly since I almost exclusively use wireless charging for my phone it would have been nice to be able to charge my headphones wirelessly too (you know... like they were advertised)

The left headphone doesn’t work without the right. So if you’re in a situation where you just want to use one of them it always has to be the right one.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Not great, not terrible","ORIGINAL: I was excited for these earbuds since most of the reviews were 4-5 stars, however my pair had a very loud static sound when playing music (to their credit they were perfectly silent when no music was playing). This sound persisted after resetting the earbuds (suggested as a static fix in the manual). I've owned cheaper earbuds which had no static, so I'm reasonably sure it isn't a problem with my device. Hopefully this was just a defective set and can either be fixed or replaced.

EDIT: I returned my original pair for a replacement; While the static is less pronounced on the new pair, it is still more present than it was on cheaper pairs, so these aren't great for quiet music.
They have good bass reproduction, but suffer when producing high notes. If all you listen to is house music, these will work perfectly, but most other things might sound off.
The charging case works well, and pairing was hassle free.
I give them 3.6 stars. Not great, not terrible.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great priced buds with great sound quality,"I haven't had these earbuds for long but they already seem like they're more than worth the money. I compared several wireless earbuds after getting annoyed with my old wireless pair while running. These were offered at a more competitive price than other wireless buds recommended for runners (most of those around 150) and also offered a high degree of waterproof which I liked because I sweat a lot.

The case they come in has this neat magnetic attachment when you go to put the buds in and doubles as a charger since you can hook up a usb cable to the back. Blue LED lights give you charge info and when you take them out of the case, you can easily pair them. There's an included instruction manual that makes that a breeze too.

The buds themselves seem sturdy and of good quality. I was a little concerned with fit because I've had trouble before but as with some other buds offered these days, these also include several different size attachments for fitting different ears. The standard pair actually fit quite well so I didn't even need to swap which is nice. The amount of noise these block from the outside when wearing them is pretty impressive too.

Now, the sound quality - the important stuff right? The first time I paired them and started listening to a game grumps podcast/Q&A... Wow - sounded crystal clear with no static or interference at all. I even went into another room and still no problems.

I can't say much about long term reliability and testing but my initial impression was very positive and I'd say I recommend these if you're looking for competitively priced wireless buds with waterproof qualities 👍",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Meh...requires some physical improvement and connectivity,"Just got the pair yesterday, tried them on doing great. It is well balance for its price. After the next day of use, right side ear piece started having issues. It’s out of sync with each other, and the right has volume issues compared to the left. Read the manual that piece should only connect to the device, and didn’t matter whether I connected to the LH or RH piece. Tried connecting both at the same time didn’t help either. Next, the charger cover is too difficult to remove. Also the charging port cover is held in pretty tight to keep water or dirt out which is nice. However, the tab used to help open the cover is too small, when trying to open the cover its strain the tab to the point of tearing it. Opening the cover is difficult, due to the small tab, tried my best to carefully not strain the tab of the cover.  Which, as predicted the tab did tear due to the strain. It would be nice if there was a better way to open cover. Finally, position of the buds is always a concern, when the position is wrong, the bud won’t play any. As a result I returned them.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not Too Happy,"I’m training for a marathon.  I can successfully say after running with this product, I was more happy with my 19 dollar Bluetooth headphones.  It’s fine for going out for every day use but it doesn’t have a long battery charge and if I was to run into another runner by accident, I run the risk of losing my headphones.  Sound quality is about the only thing it was really good for.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent product at a great price,So far love this product. When using while riding my motorcycle completely cancels all noise out when I want to. Extremely comfortable and lightweight. Can not recommend this product enough. Save your money and buy these. In my opinion just as good if not better than the more expensive products out there.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
An all around upgrade in comfort and sound quality,"I will never understand for the life of me why someone would pay so much for other wireless earbuds when we live in a world where these exist at the price they do. I enjoyed my previous version of PeohZarr wireless earbuds so much, I decided to give these a try and give my daughter my pair (since her $200 pair of Apple earbuds recently died). Man, these are a step up in every way possible, and for only $10 more than what I had paid for my original pair. I never thought I would want or need a waterproof pair of headphones, but I am honestly excited to try them out in the shower. The sound is richer, and believe it or not, they are actually more snug as well (which I didn't think was possible). On top over all of that, I think they are far more attractive than the longer earbuds that drape down the side of your face. Kudos the people behind this product, as it checks off every box for me. I won't hesitate to make these stuffing stockers this coming Christmas for all my friends and loved ones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"If the value doesn't pull you in, their customer service is phenomenal","I've owned a variety of wired and wireless headsets/earbuds and these are my new favorite.  For the price, you can't beat it for sound quality and functionality.  I mainly bought these for my workout and they fit comfortably snug.

Note: I initially had an issue with the left bud cutting in/out randomly.  I reached out to TOZO customer service and they were great.  I was taken cared of right away.  Thank you!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Listen to the Younguns...,"This is my first ear buds, I was concerned they would not be comfortable, plug my ears, most any excuse an old man could come up with. Since my grandchildren have earbuds, they convinced me to get a pair for a trip we were making to use with my phone and tablet when I wasn't driving.  Turns out they are comfortable, and have a great sound, and I've started using them with my desktop also!

Bottom line great sound, at a great price point.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wonderful Sound & Comfortable,As a pair of 'True Wireless' ear buds these have exceeded my expectations.  They have wonderful sound and great comfort.  The various size of ear cups provided allow for a precise fit to my ear.  I've worn them doing yard work and with a trimmer /mower running the noise cancellation was great.  They never felt like they were going to fall out as I have had other earbuds do.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Let me explain...,"I decided to give it a week before posting this review -

So I'll start with the pros: great with noise cancellation, bass, and battery life.
Cons:
So far I've had issues with connecting the headphones via Bluetooth on my phone - it would come in and out, even though the phone is within a few inches away from the headphones. This happened when I was walking in the streets of San Francisco though, so maybe the towers nearby threw it off (giving benefit of the doubt).

I really dislike how this company sent me an email offering a free wireless charger if I gave a 5 star review - don't do that to your customers, it's dishonest and a cheap move.

Overall, I don't think they're worth 50 bucks - shop around for a better deal.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud is not working at all.,I just received the wireless earbuds in the mail today.  I was hoping they would be great.  Instead I a seriously disappointed.  The left earbud is not functioning.  The right one is fine and it paired easily with my iPhone and Apple Watch.  The left one does not even light up.  It is definitely malfunctioning.  I should have paid the money and bought a reliable Apple product.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
they cut out,"sound is not that great, turn your head left or right they cut out even with phone in shirt pocket ,they don't fit that great left one fell out while mowing could not find it ,got junk now.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pretty friggin' good earbuds. Especially for the price!,"So far these have been a nice surprise.  The bass is full though the mids and highs are slightly muddy... but maybe im just getting old?  I've never been a fan of earbuds as they always seem to either make my ear holes sore and/ or one or both constantly pop out of my head....
Not so with these! So far these fit nice and snug (annoying without sound as they act like ear plugs the sound of breathing fills my head) and they keep all the noise you don't want out while the sound stays inside your head where it should be. Not too shabby at all!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo earphones are amazing!!,"You will love everything about this product, it comes with multiple earbud sizes for all types of ears, a charging dock that can charge up other devices and an amazing sound system. I usually don’t care for most material things but this product has impacted my life so substantially that I had to do a review. I can sync one earbud to one device and sync the other to another phone simultaneously and it allows me to get more things done in a quicker amount of time. For only $50, this is the best product you can buy by far from any others, thank you!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don't buy this product,"The first one of these had an intermittent problem of the left earbud momentarily losing Bluetooth connection.  This lasted a fraction of a second; on average, about 3-4 times per song.  It kind of killed the music experience.  Amazon sent me a replacement; but the left earbud on the replacement lost Bluetooth connection for several seconds at a time, which was totally unacceptable regardless of how many times it occurred per song.

Other than that, the case is really cool looking and is very functional.  It will recharge the earbuds about 3 times.  The user instructions are - as typical - not very good; but they at least give you the general idea of how to set it up and achieve Bluetooth pairing.  After that, it's just a matter of persistence in making it work.

HOWEVER, the fact that the left earbud loses Bluetooth connection in 2 out of 2 units suggests (to me at least) that there is a basic design flaw, which makes this product unacceptable.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not that great in my opinion,"They sound great but I have constant issues with connecting both sides. Either one will connect and other will give me issues and is a headache to change connection to another device. Also doesnt fit very well in ear. I've tried each size gel but does not stay on during a workout. Battery life is also not the greatest.
I guess I should've known I'd run into issues paying 50, but honestly they're more annoying then anything to deal with so I want to return.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Heads phones good, customer service even better!","So I have had these headphones for about three months. Due to a manufacturing defect, the right headphone has died.
With that said prior to that, the sound quality has been great and battery life excellent. I usually get through most of my work shift and then some with out any problem listening to music or audio books. For their size sound range is great and base comes through well considering their size. As for the noice cancelation, it’s not the best on the market, but in terms of their size they do an adequate job and block most noise. By the time your playing anything most noice is cut out. Load noises  do come through, like with the lawn mower, but it’s definitely better then just plain headphones.
 Now the reason I write this review has been customer service. They have been amazing and have been very supportive of their product. I have no complaints about their customer service so far. Will give an update on the review in three months time on the new headphones.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Comfortable, convenient, functional!","These earbuds are like a dream come true. I love the design -- they look really cool and subtle, compared to my last pair which made me look like I was wearing hearing aids. They are comfortable and the sound quality is great. I used them while working out and they didn't fall out of my ears. The charging case is super handy and you can charge the earbuds while also charging the charging case. I haven't encountered any issue with these at all, and I only wish I bought them sooner!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely the best I’ve had!,"I bought this here and was a bit worried it won’t work right coz i got it for a really good price. But when I got it, it was packaged so nicely.

AMAZING! Best bang for your buck - no doubt!,"I've been using these earbuds for a few days now and I absolutely love them! I spent hours researching true wireless earbuds. When I came across these, I liked that they were waterproof and noise canceling  - as I mainly use them for the gym. I've had some pretty sweaty workouts with them and they stay in. The sound is awesome too, and this is coming from a previous Beats user (when Beats were good). I've told family and friends to invest in these as well.
They come with a 1 year warranty - another plus! If you're like me and you're searching for the perfect TRULY WIRELESS earbuds - look no further!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well built product with great sound that takes some effort to keep them from falling out.,"Overall very satisfied. Took several days of trial and error in getting them to stay in my ears. Rotated through the different ear caps, found the one that stayed in ear while moving around or eating. Sound quality very good. Buds and case very sturdy. Only complaint is time before needing charge , about 3 hours. Also documentation is somewhat lacking.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Low sound volume.,"Good fitment, pairs quickly, and decent sound quality. HOWEVER if you're using them in a loud/semi loud environment, you can hardly hear them at full volume. I've tried using them while cutting the grass and running a saw, and all you can make out is a slight mumble of what you're listening to. Thinking it was my phone, I plugged in my corded headphones with the volume at max and it nearly made my ears bleed it was so loud. I might keep these as a back up or just to workout in, but for what I need headphones for most of all, is going to require me to buy another set from someone else unfortunately.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for Programming,"Firstly, the sound quality on these things is surprisingly good for being earbuds. The noise cancellation will depend on whether you can find a good-sized rubber end. For me, the medium sized one works the best.

They're okay for working out. Being cordless is a huge plus, and the noise cancellation works really well. But they have a tendency to fall out if you don't press them in hard. I haven't had to use these in a wet environment yet, but their waterproofing is rated really well.

The batteries are also really weak, but the charging case that comes with it can do about 4 full charges. I use these a lot at work while I'm programming, and I've never had to charge them more than twice. The case can also be charged wirelessly which is cool.

My last gripe is about the lack of volume control. You can't use any buttons to turn up/down the volume. All volume control has to be done through the device that's connected through Bluetooth which, for me, is usually my phone, and I don't like having to take my phone out of my pocket to change the volume.

Overall, these are great wireless buds. They have high sound quality, and the wireless charging and cordlessness make them pretty hassle-free.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for a great price,"I bought these for wearing at my computer. They have great sound and pretty good battery life. These actually sound better than my AirPods.

Good Head Phones - Not for small ears,"I've had these for a few weeks and really have no complaints aside from they dont fit in my ears, with the smallest attachments on. The left headphone doesnt fit at all - the right headphone requires adjustments all the time.

They hold a charge well and have pretty good music quality for the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Glad I got these and not paying $140 for others,"Perfect for what I wanted. I didn't want to spend 140 on ear buds that didn't or didn't like. They are comfortable don't fall out and the battery on one charge seems to last about 2 1/2 hours. The case is small and convenient and charges the ear buds fast. It has a nice indicator on the box.

Putting the ear buds back into the case is great.... They are easily marked R & L and the magnets make sure it stays in the box. I may get another pair!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Customer Service,"I read that these were waterproof earbuds but when my dog accidentally kicked them into the spa they immediately stopped working even though the depth was less than 1 meter and they were in there for less than two minutes. In reaching out to TOZO directly they offered to ship me a new right earbud for free without the hassle of returning the other. The response took less than 24 hours and as of right now I am very pleased with how this played out! Can't wait to use them again, although I am a little hesitant to leave them so close to the spa next time!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Love the design, but battery life is nowhere near what advertised","Design is good -- the buds feel sturdy as does the case; they more or less stay securely in my ears (a big problem with almost every other earbud I've tried.) But the battery life is a big problem: they advertise ""over 3.5 hours’ playtime from a single charge""; I've never gotten anywhere near that. I rarely get over 2 hours of playback, which kinda sucks, since it means they barely last for a workout. The RIGHT earbud (at least in my pair) is always the one to die first; it seems to hold only about 75% of the charge as the left one. A UX gripe I have is that from the moment you get the first low-battery warning, you have about 30-seconds of playback remaining before the earbuds die. That's pretty lame; if you don't have the case with you, there's not much you can even do. The warning should signify 5-10 mins left (imo).",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Not a great item, but maybe for the price.","I figured I would give these a try since they were priced pretty cheap but after I used it a few times....figured out why. They connect to your bluetooth on their own, so when you're on your phone and all of a sudden the sound goes mute, probably because the ear buds connected to your phone by it self. Just does it on its own. Kinda weird. Batteries die pretty fast, within a day, even if they're just sitting in its case. I had previously owned Ray's and they were awesome but after i ruined them I thought I would try these cause they were half the price...now I know why. Only good thing about these are the sound. Clear and nice base to them, but Im sure after a few months of use they will go bad.
Can't say great value but super cheap for what they are. Only good thing about these ear buds would be the price.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Exceeded My Expectations,"First off with so many products to choose from I couldn't ignore the amount of positive reviews. Still sceptical, I went ahead and purchased these with the amazing price knowing now what I get out of these ear buds.
One of the first things I did after unboxing was figure out the perfect size for me and I'm glad i did. The Bluetooth is unbeatable! I absolutely hate being locked in one spot if I don't want to lug my phone around at the gym. (Might as well still have a cord) Walking to go get water across the gym was no problem with no disconnection. The capability of starting and stopping music with both the left and the right ear buds came in handy on multiple occasions. One thing I was surprised about was the sound quality and the noise cancellation capability. I've been through so many headphones and ear buds from high end brands to knock offs and always seemed to be disappointed with some aspect of them from sounds quality to Bluetooth connection. One last thing i will highlight on would be the battery life and charging box. I couldnt beleive how long these lasted and how quick they recharge in a pinch. Overall these ear buds from Tozo has checked every box for me and easily became my go to for everyday/ every occasion use.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best Bang for Your Buck,"I love these earbuds.. you definitely get a bang for your buck and the sound quality is pretty solid. I’ve added an image to show the sizing of the buds.

These don't have audiophile quality sound, but let me tell you, the bass was a great balance with the treble and mid-tones and I haven't had a problem with them falling out whatsoever.

First, the construction of the buds and case is pretty solid and durable. Second, the pairing of the buds to each other and to my phone (Galaxy S9) was pretty quick and consistent.  Also, the sound quality is pretty good..deep bass. I've used the buds on a commuter railroad and have not been disappointed. All in all, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, life, range, & build quality","I've been using these earbuds since July, and they've been absolutely fantastic. The range is almost ridiculous, even when I forget my phone and go into other rooms without my phone. The battery life is great. I only use one earbud at a time while working (listening to audio books or podcasts all day) and one bud lasts from 8am until about 4-4:30pm.

I love the charging case - very rugged, and I only need to charge it every 2 or 3 days (probably because of the one earbud thing).

I only have one complaint that keeps it from being a 5 star review, which is, again, related to my using one earbud at a time. When you first power it up, it beeps continuously for like two or three minutes, looking for the other earbud to pair. There's no way to stop it, and it's really irritating because it interrupts what I'm listening to for that first couple of minutes. If they come out with a firmware update that turns that off, these things will be perfect.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Quality for a Reasonable Price,"These earbuds are not bad. Personally, I use these earbuds for workout sessions so I have no problem to stay in a stationary place to workout. Overall, the earbuds are comfortable. The ability to change the earbuds size was a plus as it allows you to change the size according to your ear size for comfort. Pairing didn't take long at all. The charging case looks well made and seems durable. The sound quality is great, good amount of sounds comes out for almost any song really. When jogging or doing any cardio related exercises, these earbuds so far does the job in staying put in your ears.

"Good sound, noise cancellation, and comfort; sometimes repeated disconnect/reconnect during call",Sound quality and comfort are good for me. This is one of those things that is subjective: they will work well for some people and not well for others. One thing I do not like is they sometimes disconnect and reconnect multiple times during a call. This generally seems to be when in the business environment with signal quality challenges.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Could be a good product if they fixed the bluetooth.,"At first I was impressed with the sound quality, fit and the case. However I ran into a HUGE problem. The bluetooth on these is horrible! If I walked beyond 5 feet of my phone, they would cut out. Additionally, even with my phone in my pocket, they would cut out every 30 seconds in one ear, sometimes both. It's too bad, because other than that, they seemed good. Looks like others have had the very same issue. I tried to disconnect an repair the bluetooth but same results. I ended up getting the Juckbo 5.0 Earbuds and couldn't be more pleased. More comfortable and bluetooth works across the house. Not as loud, but loud enough.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Okay earbuds for the price,"My experience from this product:
-decent base and volume output
-battery life for non-stop music play was about 3 hours
-left ear bud goes silent randomly
-after 1.5 months of daily use the volume from left earbud was really low and the charging case stopped working
-sometimes the earbuds won't charge if you just put it back into the case. I had to wiggle them around until the red light came on to indicate that they were charging.

I'm getting a replacement product due to my left defective earbud. TOZO was very responsive in honoring their warranty. Hopefully i'll have a better experience the second time around.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
best earbuds ever made,"I really liked the product. I have an iphone 8 but because of my outer ear canals I am unable to use default iphone head sets. These earbuds perfectly fit to my ear and no matter how hard I shake my head, it never fall off. The sound quality is also excellent. At the beginning, I had some difficulties over the built-in microphone then I realized that I should cover my mount with my head. Doing so my voice goes directly into the microphone. I used the product under the heavy rain one time and I can assure that it is 100% water-resistant. Again I really appreciate to TOZO company for creating a #1 quality product",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very comfortable and secure in your ears!,"I really like that the ear buds fit so well, I was very pleased with how quick they paired also...so easy! I charged them when I took them out of the box but I think they were already partially charged as they were useable immediately....and love that the charger will charge them 4 times before needing to be connected to USB port.....highly recommend...and the price is very good for a water proof earbud with such a great fit.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Earbuds, Better Value","These earbuds far exceeded my expectations for the price. Primarily use them to listen to music to go to sleep without disturbing my wife (or being disturbed by her snoring! Sorry, honey...) Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is good; I can't hear her mild-to-moderate snoring next to me when they are on. Battery life is good, also. I have the headphones on for anywhere from 4-6hrs per night and only need to charge them twice a week. I highly recommend. I'd give 5-stars, but I don't know what to judge them against since it seems I got lucky on my first pick!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bluetooth wireless earbuds,My husband uses these daily and after months of daily use no problems at all. Definitely a quality product for a good price. Easy to hear on video chat while he’s working out of town. Great earbuds for the price.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
DONT BUY! Worked for 1 week only,"Very disappointed, they only worked for 1 week, now i can’t use them on my Garmin because it would never connect, sometimes bluetooth doesn’t find them or sometimes it does but it won’t connect (displays error every time) and when i try to use them with my Iphone mobile it would only pair one side, Right and Left won’t sync anymore (i read the manual and tried many times using their instructions but it won’t work).
I NEED A REFUND ASAP!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent wireless ear buds, great sound comfort and battery life","First off let me say, these airbuds are super comfortable, I can wear them all day without them hurting ears. I bought an expensive one from BB and had to return them a week later because they were so uncomfortable.  But I love TOZO T10.  In regards to the noise cancellation, my true test would be on plane and so far I haven’t taken them on a plane.  However, on the subway, they block out most outside noise.

For the sound, this is one of the main reason, I purchased this T10. The sounds, especially the bass is amazing, crystal clear withnot distortion even when the volume is high.  The Bluetooth pairing  is breeze, and I like that you listen to one side only if needed.
The battery life is excellent, I believe I gone a full 2 hours of listening to music and watching movies before, the battery indicator moved half way....and thats impressive.  Overall, I would highly recommend these wireless ear bud to anyone. Don’t be discouraged by the price, thinking they are cheap...they are well made and the sound, comfort, and battery life is great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality; super snug for my little ears!,"These are a great replacement for my old Bluetooth ear buds that die after 30 minutes!
So far, I’ve charged them once and been on 2 different 60 minute bike rides; battery is still going strong. They are lightweight, have good sound quality, easy to pair, and I love that they come with 4 different silicone inner ear sizes!
The charging case is solid, and great magnetic lid; I’m not worried about losing these.
Great purchase, very satisfied, definitely recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Don’t waste your money.,In order for these to work you have to delete them from your Bluetooth every time you use them. They won’t work if you don’t Do that. Also the battery and one only lasts about an hour. Very difficult to use the ear buds that hold them in your ear that come on are very huge and it’s virtually impossible to change them with the smaller ones.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than I ever expected,I just received my new earbuds and they are better than I expected.  I have been searching for the right set of earbuds for 3 months when I can across this product on Amazon.  After reading the reviews I decided to give them a try.  Boy an I not disappointed. The sound quality is amazing and they fit in my ear perfectly.  I love the carrying case. I am very much impressed with this product.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds!!!,"Love these earbuds, the sound quality is exceptional.  I had issues at first but I was able to get great satisfaction and help with customer service.

Buy These Headphones!!,"I'm always on the fence when it comes to buying earbuds because I'm never convinced they'll fit in my ears. Initially I bought these for traveling but I've recently been using them to work out and they're perfect! I'm pretty sure one of my ear holes is bigger than the other 🙃but since these come with 4 different bud sizes, I'm able to run, jump, lay sideways and still keep the earbuds in BOTH my ears. I'm truly happy with my purchase and definitely recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones.

They were also delivered extremely fast and the customer service reps have been phenomenal. After I registered for the warranty, one reached out to me directly to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and even offered me a free wireless charger.

If you need wireless bluetooth earbuds, look no further - BUY THESE NOW!!

---------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: My earbuds starting having weird issues (like taking several minutes to pair with bluetooth) and TOZO sent me a brand new pair immediately with no hassle. I definitely recommend these headphones. Not just because they're great quality, but because the company's customer service is A1!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Product/ Great Customer Service,"Let me tell you, this company is great. I ordered these headphones, had them for half a day (and absolutely loved the sound) and then went to work and lost it, which was my fault. I was super bummed out, but I was really going to order them again cause I was actually really impressed. But I decided to email customer support and see if they could do anything for me and now they’re sending me a whole new pair. Beyond impressed. Quality product and an actual decent company. Would recommend to everyone if you enjoy real sound.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, great fit and great chargeable storage box","I was skeptical about buying a ear bud, having bad experience with other products.  This one is a charm amazing sound quality, amazing fit and amazing comfort. I have been using it every day since I received, have been with it on Treadmill, jumping up, floor exercise and many more.. it hasn’t popped out and hasn’t been uncomfortable either.. so far quite happy with the purchase.

Haven’t tried much to conclude how good is battery life, but can day for sure it lasted like a charm for 2hrs every day for back to back days before I put it on charge

Not to forget the amazing wireless chargeable box it comes with..

All in all thumbs up for this product..",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
How well they fit/feel in my ears.,"I was always a skeptic about wireless earbuds because I felt there was no way they could stay in any ear including my little ears until my daughter got a pair. I became more intrigued by them and how easy it was to wear them. I found myself this wonderful pair of TOZO T10 bluetooth earbuds here on Amazon (it was one of their daily deals). When they arrived I immediately thought they were to big, but once I read the directions on how so insert them and correctly choose the right size ear piece, I forget that I even have them in sometimes because they are so comfortable. I'm very happy that I chose to give them a try and would recommend them to anyone. And the price was amazing>",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Final Update - These things rock.,"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!

UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.
Bottom line:
- first product worked well except for drops - but they were so frequent in certain places it was maddening
- second product worked like a charm and does not seem to have any of the dropping issues
- they want to be sure you are happy so the customer service was lightning fast and with no questions asked
- If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, give these a try.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to have a good battery life.  Unfortunately, they drop signal 3-4xs per minute.  I did a bit of troubleshooting to make sure it was the earbuds and not the device.  I paired it with several devices and the earbuds always dropped signal.  I then paired all of the devices with several other bluetooth headphones and speakers I have (including an Echo).  All of the devices played flawlessly through all of the speakers without dropping signal.  However, these drop regularly.  Sometimes it will go for a minute or two without dropping, sometimes certain places seem to make it worse, but, overall, it happens several times per minute.  It makes an otherwise decent pair of earbuds unusable.  I will return these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Earbuds!,"The sound on these is excellent. They pair quickly with my iPod. I bought a second pair for my daughter who uses them to block out noise while studying. I had an issue with the charger after several months. I emailed the excellent customer service and received a brand pair in the mail within days, even though I only needed the charger. I highly recommend these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I Bought 2 Sets!,"I've been waiting to pick up AirPods for a while now but couldn't justify paying $140 for something that falls out of my ear. After some intense searching I came a crossed this set. After reading the reviews I went for it and was not disappointed! Not only are they much more comfortable then the pods but the sound is imo much better and clear. I've been using these a few weeks now on and off and have only changed them once. They come with different size earbuds so you dont have to worry about comfort or noise cancellation being an issue. I'm also really fond of the style and color. The case does change the earbuds as well and has a set of lights to indicate the charge which is super convenient. My husband ""stole"" my first set so I ordered another for myself.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Unfortunately!!!,"Lets start off with the good, these headphones sound great, probably one of the best sounding headphones I've tried. Deep strong bass even at low volumes without distortion. Unfortunately, these headphones are the most annoying pair with stupid little annoying features built right in. The bluetooth connection sucks, it takes a while before it connects auto, than when it does, it talks to much, ""right channel connected, left channel connected, connected"" if you press play on your song before its done saying all that it'll fail the connection completely. You can only use the right headphone by itself if you want, but if you do, the right will constantly chirp/beep, every few seconds no matter what, even if you have a song on or you're on the phone. The programming on it sucks so bad, there's even times when they won't disconnect from my phone even after I put both headphones in their case/charger. These would've been awesome headphones but those mistakes are so annoying, I've had them for a few days and I have to return them because they'll raise your blood pressure, so my recommendation is to AVOID these headphones!!!",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best wireless headsets for the price!,I received my TOZO headphones a few days ago and have had nothing but great things to say about them! The sound quality is amazing and once you find the right earpiece they are a very secure fit. I used them at the gym for over an hour doing heavy lifting without having to worry about them falling out and I have also ran 3 miles on my treadmill without them coming loose either! I would and have recommended these headphones to everyone searching for wireless headsets!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A good buy,"I listen to audiobooks mostly while working and it seriously sounds like the narrator is inside my head. When I've listened to music, the sound is rich and full.

The battery life is ""meh."" But when I remove them, I return them to the portable charging case. So, no big deal. It was a good buy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Right earbud quit after getting in water.,"I am writing a review having only used these earbuds for a few weeks. Until the incident I will describe further, the earbuds worked great. Good sound, good connection with my device and a good fit once we used the right fitting provided. However, after using the earbuds in the shower, as we were inclined to believe this would be okay, I dropped one of them in the water for just a split second. Then, about a day later it stopped working. I tried to revive it using even a hairdryer (per the advice of a customer rep) but to no avail. So I’ve been working with other reps to get a replacement. After communicating with Amazon and Tozo for a few too many times, I think I’m going to get a replacement. So I’m waiting for that and then I can write another review to let you know how that went.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very impressed - Quality product,"I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 earbuds. Especially given the price, these are a quality product with great sound and easy pairing. I have gone through about a half dozen wireless headphones the past few years and these earbuds sound great and are super comfortable when wearing. I run regularly and recently ran 6+ miles on a treadmill and did not have any issues with these falling out of my ears or cutting out due to wetness or issues with the bluetooth connection.
It took a few times using these earbuds to find the correct size for my ear but the additional ear plug sizes were helpful and I was able to find one that fits without falling out.
The wireless charging is super convenient too. Definitely recommend this product for an affordable, high-quality product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound Quality ✔️Easy to Use ✔️Sleek ✔️Stylish ✔️Bang for Buck ✔️Fit ✔️,"I've gone through several wireless ear buds in my day, and this one really works well. The sound quality is good (not for audiophiles, but for your average music listener). The design is sleek and can easily fit in my pocket; the case and the buds also look pretty good, though I would say it looks a wee bit bulky; I personally prefer the white. I haven't had any concerns of these buds falling out of my ear with the standard fit it came with (there are other fits supported as well) while biking and some gentle walking; very minimal re-adjustment is ever needed maybe every hour or so. The price point makes this particularly attractive. I've also had very little issue with the battery life, being able to listen for several hours without any threat of the buds dying. The nice thing is the charging case, so you can re-charge on the go up to 4 full charges! That's awesome. The fact that the charging case works with wireless charging is just extra icing on the cake here.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality,"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds.  I was a little nervous because I have very small ears and wasn’t sure they would fit.  However, they include multiple sizes of covers.  They still aren’t super tight in my ears, but I’ve figured out how to put them in properly and they fit pretty well & stay in while I work out.  I bought them to swim laps in, but haven’t tried that yet because it’s still too cold.  Overall, I’m quite pleased with them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Bad microphone quality!,"While the bluetooth pairing worked better than expected; the microphone quality on both iPhone and Android is seriously lacking to the point of unusuability. I tried multiple settings and configurations to address this but everytime folks complain about not being able to hear me so I have to just turn them off. It's unfortunate because I really wanted these to work. Also after having them out of use for awhile I wasnt sure if the battery was dead or not because they wouldnt turn on again until I put them in the case. Kind of weird, because I put them in for less than a second and they were on again. Not sure what's going on.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
falls out of ear,"I was looking for wireless earbuds for running.  I have the bose with the ear piece that wraps around the ear.  I wear glasses plus like to put a hat on in the summer.  It was too much at the ear and caused pain.  Plus, the Bose could not sit flush with my head and I lost sound quality.  These TOZOs were rated well on Amazon so I tried them.  They connect fine but are heavy.  I tried the different ear pieces.  If you sit still, you may be OK, but it you move, they fall out.  I could not keep the left one in my ear.  I returned these.  I hope the return goes smoothly.  But, I ordered the Klipsch that are buds and a wire running between them, but no ear piece to wrap around.

Excellent pair of wireless earbuds,"So far there is nothing to dislike about the Tozo T10 wireless earbuds, but only all to love.
I've had these for one week and the battery life is excellent; slightly exceeding the stated spec..
The charging case is a great feature for those on the go or travelling, and the remaining charge indicator LEDS are really helpful.
Leaving the best for last; the fit and sound quality:
Once you've installed the ear tip the best fits your ear, and you've placed the unit in your ear as instructed, they fit snug and are very much secure in your ear. This allowed me to go running and there was no movement or shifting once they're in place.
The quality of the sound, the lows, mids and high frequencies far exceeded my expectations. And, there was no sign of distortion at higher volume levels.

All in all, an excellent product at a reasonable price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Believe the hype of these reviews....,"I'm honestly trying to think of bad things to say about these headphones but I can't. My friend has them and let me try his and i was sold. The sound quality is ridiculously good for how small they are and they connect with ANY device super quickly. Having multiple ear sizes is great cause my ears have an odd shape.

All these reviews are right when they say these bad boys STAY IN YOUR EARS. Shake your head, get sweaty, taking calls, or doing errands around the house. I would recommend these to anyone and everyone (and i have). Not many products deserve 5 stars but these headphones do.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wonderful earbuds,"I love the fact you can charge it on a wireless charging pad. I love the face you can use the earbuds separately or together and the sound quality is wonderful. They pair with my phone quickly.
They were a struggle in the beginning to figure out how to settle in my ear in a way that they didn’t fall out when I chewed or moved around a lot.
The only complaint I have is that they disconnect frequently from my phone. I will be listening to something and it just randomly disconnects or gets really staticky for about 10 seconds and then fixes itself.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

But overall, I liked it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good earbuds with some issues,"**I added a star because the vendor is truly concerned about their customers, and I've gotten more comfortable with these earbuds, and have found that I enjoy them even more. Other than their weight/size maybe not being ideal for all ears, these are probably the best reasonably priced earbuds I've found.

These earbuds are well made and the charging box has plenty of oomph to keep things going throughout a long day. The ear buds have excellent battery life and good range, and certainly more than 30ft, in my experience. But I suppose that would vary depending on the environment. They are a bit on the heavy side but can lock reasonably well in the ear. Sound is also very powerful, but this is also an issue with my setup. The problem is that my iPhone7S can't reduce the volume to a point that I'm always happy with; some music is good but others I'd like to turn-down the volume and the lowest setting just isn't low enough for my taste -- If you like loud music these are definitely good though. Sound quality is good too, but maybe just a bit heavy on the bass. Again a personal preference. Sound cancelling is good, but because I can't find a volume that's always comfortable, I end-up not seating them as securely in my ears so I do lose some of that benefit, plus they're more likely to fall out then. Can't really blame the construction or function for this, because I'm not really using them properly. The more major issue, for music, is that I like to be able to do more than pause songs, I like to be able to skip songs and change volume from the ear buds, and that's not supported; you can only pause on them, so you have to keep your device available to perform those functions. Lastly, both earbuds pair with themselves very reliably, but I manually have to select them under Bluetooth devices to connect them to my iPhone7S. They always go into pairing mode but don't auto-connect like my other earbuds. Overall, they're high quality earbuds with a few operational issues, but they have the most powerful sound of any that I've used to date.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The sound quality is excellent. Better than I expected. A solid case with magnetic closure to store them in that also allows recharging even when not connected to a power supply. They easily pair with my iPhone and  computer via Bluetooth 5.0. Pods fit comfortably in the ear and come with different size tips to accommodate different ear sizes. The pods have a built-in microphone, so making/receiving phone calls are an added bonus! All in all, if you are looking for an economical alternative/replacement for Apple's AirPods, these Tozo T10's are it.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
High performance for affordable price,"I ordered these because I wanted something wireless and waterproof for when I worked out and was doing chores around the house. I was so impressed by these. Great sound, sleek and compact charging case, and extremely easy to use.
Just take them out of the case and they automatically power on and pair, and you’re good to go. Way better than than apple air pods for far less money. I strongly suggest you purchase these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Horray for the reset function.,"I really enjoy these earbuds. I was worried they might be prone to falling out due to the lack of ear hooks, but I have not had a problem with them so far. I like how the button press is gentle and you don't end up jammin it into your ear just to press the button. What I am very glad about is the ability to reset the earbuds in the event of a pairing problem.  I had another different brand that you couldnt reset and they ended up bricking on me one day and I returned them so I could buy these instead.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
STOPPED WORKING AFTER A MONTH!,"I don't know where all this five stars reviews are from but that certainly was not my experience. I bought this phone at the beginning of September and as of now it has stopped working. The right headphones won't turn on and connect to any devices. When it was working the sound quality wasn't the best. Noise cancellation is a joke because I could hear everything still while using this headphone. Also, it keeps slipping out of my ears and I was just walking while using them, not running or doing high intensity workouts. For $50 and over 13,000 reviews with 4.5/5 stars I expected better than this.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Truth about all the 5 star ratings for this product.,"There are a lot of customers that have given this product a 5 star rating. Here is the reason why- after I bought these headphones I got an email from TOZO asking me to give them a 5 star rating and they would send me a free charging pad. I am sure most people who gave these headphones were motivated by the free gift and not by the quality of the product. I obviously declined.
The headphones are average at best, I had issues with frequent disconnects initially but has gotten better over time. The sound quality is a average.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Only comes with one size of ear buds,"Just received these today. Nicely packaged. Very easy to pair right out of the box. Excellent sound. Will have to see how long the battery lasts. Only complaint is that although the manual references different sizes of the little rubber ear inserts, these were not included. So if the one that came with these is too big or small for you, you're out of luck.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These for the win.,"These are pretty great I must say. Reviews say it all. I’ve owned a lot of headphones in the past and these are top. Easy to connect, charge, and keep with ya at all times.

Awesome earbuds,"One of the best purchases I made on Amazon was these earbuds.  Had these for over a month now without a single problem.  Comfortable, great for working out, sound quality is excellent compared to other more expensive brands.  Took these on an international flight and worked better to block out unwanted cabin sound compared to the actual noise cancelling headphones that came with the flight.  Will likely buy another pair.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

These are on a whole other level of awesomeness!!,"So the Tozo T10 5.0 wireless ear buds are my first set of true wireless earbuds but had many traditional headphones and earbuds with wires and those wireless earbuds that use a wire to link both sides. With that being said I'll never look back!
  First off the Tozo's were a great deal with awesome reviews for under $50.  I've payed $80 for wireless Skull Candy's and there is no comparison.
  Keep in mind I purchased these to use at work and I'm a welder. So one major problem I've always had was metal dust getting stuck in the earbuds due to the magnet and getting destroyed. I haven't had that problem at all so far with these. The other thing I loved with these were that u could use one at a time and take calls with perfect quality! I would definetly recommend these to anyone looking to buy a new set of headphones. They would never go back to the old style.

Pros
  Amazing battery life
  Make and receive calls with no issues
  Sound quality is awesome for the price
  Waterproof
  Stays put while in ear

Cons

"Great sound, comfortable and connection doesn't drop","Great sound and fits well, not at all uncomfortable. The best part is the connection, so far its flawless. I've owned a different pair when this type first came out and it would drop connection all the time, very distracting. Not these, have not dropped once. So far (just got them) these are fantastic.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome sound and awesome price,I bought these as my first pair of wireless headphones. I was not disappointed. The sound is very good even when I just have one in at work. My box was missing the extra earbud covers. I felt like I needed the smaller size because they seemed to fall out of my ears easily. I emailed this company and they responded immediately and made it right. I believe this is a great product at a great price! I am not one to spend $100 on stuff like this. Perfect for teens that tend to lose things easily.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I Love These Amazing Earbuds,"I was looking for a pair of earbuds I could use whilst working out. I won a number of ""high end"" headphones such as Shure, Sony, Bose, etc but wanted a fully wireless pair that sounded decent. I tried a number of wireless earbuds from BestBuy such as Sony, Sennheiser, Beats, etc, but wasn't impressed at all with their sound quality. I came across these on Amazon, but was skeptical as the price seemed quite low for what the manufacturer claimed they could do and how they sounded. I decided to give them a try as Amazon have an excellent returns policy.

I am very glad I got these. They sound amazing. Much better than the much more expensive ones I tried from Best Buy. I also thought the features, look, feel and quality of both the earbuds and the chargeable carrying case are excellent. They were extremely easy to pair with both my phone and my laptop. They fit snugly and securely in my ear, and are very easy to insert and take out. If I were talking about $150+ earbuds, I would still be very happy with these, but considering that they cost me less than $50, they are simply amazing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are a great value and easy to set up,"This is my second set of wireless earbuds. This set stands out - the only reason I didn't give 5 stars in battery life is that the case seems to need to be recharged every time, not when it drops to 2 or 1 status lights. The earbuds are comfortable to wear for prolonged periods, and the set was easy to pair - first to my laptop, then to my Kindle Fire when my needs changed.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome Product - Better than Airpods,These earbuds are amazing.  I could tell from the way they were packaged that this was going to be a quality product.  Once you find the right size earbud attachment they are very comfortable and they stay in your ear.  The sound quality is great and they even have good bass.  I put one of these in my ear and an airpod in my other ear and I could honestly not tell the difference.  I had my wife who has never tried either before do a blind test and she picked the TOZO brand stating that they were more comfortable and had better bass.  For a quarter of the price of a second generation airpod you get a similar product that is waterproof!  I would definitely recommend this product! Great customer service too!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great product for the price BUT....(Update: waiting for the replacement),"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago and I was using it pretty much all the time, at work, at home and even for working out. My first impression was WOW this is cool, everything was fine until suddenly the left earbud start going on and off, either on a call or playing some media, also noted that got worst if I started moving my head, don't know why but that was what I noted. Also the other day I was working on my yard, and I was in a squat position with my phone in my left pocket, and the media started cutting off, then when I stood up was fine, I did it repeatedly to reproduce the issue, and yes, it was an issue, every time, same behaviour.
When is working sound quality is great, noise reduction is great, I used at work to avoid distractions and look and feel is great also, I didn't try any of the really expensive ones, but this ones, except for the issues explained above, are good. I just hope is a problem with the pair I got and not with the product itself.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great when it works...,"Can have good sound quality with loud bass, but only when they work. IF they can connect to your device AND you are sitting VERY still, they produce great sound, but move just a little and the sound breaks up. Exercising at the gym? Nope. Walking with your phone in your pocket? Nope. Eating lunch at a restaurant? Nope. Sitting in a chair while typing on a keyboard? Sure, but don't change position. They also had about a 1 to 4 chance of actually connecting at any given time. Overall, I found this product to be far more frustrating than I could tolerate.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Audio quality and perfect service,"I'm very impressed with Tozo T10. First, the sound quality is balanced between the bass and treble. When playing a Bass Shaker test track which will literally shake the audio drivers in earbuds. On the sweeping tone test, It also can stay clear and pure. I need to say the cost & performance of T10 is very high. If you are the one one who wants to enjoy music. T10 should be on your list. By the way, the blue tooth connection is easy. With Bluetooth 5.0 I can answer the call even far away from my phone. It's also convenient to clean earbuds by washing them for IPX8.
The most important is that the service is perfect. I bought this for a business trip to the USA. When back to Taiwan the charging box is broken. It can't charge anymore. They're kind and enthusiastic to help me to fix it.
Thank you, Katherine. You are really doing a good job.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Bang for the buck,"I have tried several ear-buds and have had mixed luck. They always fall off with the slightest movement - perhaps my ears are not meant for them. However, I have had some great luck with these ear-buds. They fit well, are comfortable and provide great sound quality. I have used them on conference call with some good results. I have had some issues as my voice wasn't too clear at the other end but then it was probably due to the fact that I was walking in Manhattan with the wind blowing. Other times sound has been clear both ways. I highly recommend these. I use them on planes a lot as I travel weekly for work and they reduce the outside noise greatly. Nice product at a reasonable price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good for the price.,"I believe that earbuds are very much personal, so I'll write down my personal impression. The Tozo is very good, but they seem to fall off my ear, I've tried all sizes of ear piece included, even a few more, but they all didn't work. Sound is great, connection awesome, charging and case amazing for the price. One big downside is the microphone, I use them a lot, wile listening I receive call and need a earbuds to feature well on calls, but Tozo mic don't seem to capture my voice well, and the other side of the line didn't listen to me, and a lot of background noise, even thou I'm in a quiet place. Bottom line, Tozo is fantastic for listening and noise canceling, as long as you don't need to use it on calls, and don't mind then falling off a bit.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Just What I was Looking For,"I have been wanting a pair of wireless earbuds that I could buy for a decent price and good quality. I wanted it to be at least below $100 dollars. Upon buying these I had low expectations being that the last earbuds I bought were not ideal-the sound quality was poor and they did not stay in my ears. However after buying these I was impressed.

1. Design:
The first impression of this product was how it looked when it came out of the box. I was surprised to find that these earbuds appeared and felt as though they were more expensive than just $50. The charging case had a heavy feel to it instead of a light, cheap design. The earbuds and case lid are magnetized so they stay in the case and the lid stays shut. These features are both really nice to have. The earphones themselves have touch control for playing music/adjusting volume.

2. Sound Quality
Unlike some music listeners, I am a real bass head, and these earbuds do just that. They have the perfect amount of base that doesn't drown out the treble.

3. Noise Cancellation
These earphones effectively block out outside noises, but not completely.

4. Battery Life and Wireless Charging
I think for the amount of time that I use these wireless earbuds the battery life is long lasting. With the case fully charged I am given 4 hours of playtime. It only takes about 20 minutes to charge the earbuds in the case. I also like that the case can be charged wirelessly. This makes it much easier to charge the case than connecting it to USB.

Overall I really like these earbuds and they surprised me when I first tried them out. In my opinion they may even exceed the sound quality (but not the functionality) of $150 dollar airpods. I definitely suggest these to people who may be looking for a similar design but for a much cheaper price.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound quality,These earbuds have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation especially for the price. I've actually been getting quite a bit longer out of the battery than advertised so battery life is good as well. Unfortunately I started having connection issues with one of the earbuds but customer support responded very quickly and they are being replaced so I have no complaints at all with this product.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best deal out there!,"Stop looking for quality earbuds: You've found them! Out of the factory sealed box, they had 100% charge and were ready to go! They paired seamlessly and they sound great! Great bass and if you use the correct rubber pieces, great seal and noise cancelling. My favorite feature is the range. I sat my phone down on my porch and was able to cut my entire 3/4 acre yard and didnt lose signal! Most impressive. I sweated like crazy all over them and they just keep going. I've used them in the gym on benchpress day as well and they stayed put while I moved heavy weight and sweated profusely. All around, great bang for your buck. The charging case is very solid as well. These could cost way more than $50 so this is a great bargain.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud cuts out- DONT WASTE YOUR TIME with these!!,"I was really excited and hopeful for these earbuds, as they were my first wireless earbuds. However, I received them a few hours ago, charged them, and took them with me to the gym. At the gym now and wasn’t even able to work out with them for ONE MINUTE without the left earbud cutting out CONSTANTLY. Thankfully, I had my other pair of headphones with me and I’m using those as I’m sitting, writing this review.

These are junk. There’s obviously a glitch, since many others have had this same EXACT problem. The manufacturer should really fix it. Til then, these are going back. Don’t waste your time buying these!!",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Quality Earbuds for an Affordable Price,"This product is nice for working on the computer or listening to music while reading. However, the reason I gave it 4 stars was because moving around while them in my ears causes them to fall out no matter which soft ear piece size I used.

Pairing was easy and they don't cut out like other bluetooth earbuds. The caring case is convenient to throw in a pocket and have to backup charging. At first I was a little disappointed that the right earbud is the primary but since they are identical you can use it in either ear. I have tiny ears so I was worried about fit and comfort but with the different size converters, these should easily fit any size ears.

Amazing for the money,"Was gonna get some new apple air pods, but didn't want to spend so much.  These were also water proof, which I've used in the shower over and over.  I love them, work great, decent distance from device, audio quality is a solid 8 out of 10, and connection pairing isn't quite as smooth as apple, but really works pretty well.  The only complaint I have is if you only want to use 1 it will beep for about 30 seconds signalling it is trying to find the other one, and if you don't ever connect them it will finally stop the beeping, I haven't found a way to get it to not do that.  but its a minor price to pay considering I usually use both ears, which connects super fast.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I do have some trouble with the fit and occasionally one of them will pop out, but I have found that to be true of every earbud I’ve ever tried. I think it’s just something about my ears. But it happens less with these than with others I have used so I am pleased. I would recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, but too many negatives","I previously had wireless bluetooth headphones that were connected to each other via a cable and this upgrade to the 2 individual earbuds was something I didn't know how much I'd appreciate. I was especially impressed when I put them on and heard the sound. Every song I listen to sounds new with the great bass and full sound. In addition, the microphone is actually useable, which is something that hasn't been the case with my previous Bluetooth headphones.

The negatives for this is that the connection between the two earbuds gets out of sync often, which results in either an echo or audio drop outs almost every time I'm walking around with them. In addition, when you take the headphones out of the case to start using them, it takes about 20-30 seconds of booting up, syncing with each other then finally my phone. With my previous pair of headphones I'd turn them on and could be listening within 3-5 seconds.

Because of these pretty big usability issues, I may be returning these.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It's a great small headset,I mainly got these headsets because I sometimes like to wear a hat on a hot day and bulky over the ears headsets don't fit if I have one on. I usually don't get in the ear headsets because they never managed to fit me. They just pop out of my ear. But these are suprisingly snug and light. Its great to were for a couple of hours for workout and commute to work. An added bonus is that the seller cares about your purchase and how happy you are about it. It's a breath of fresh air on Amazon to be honest and I greatly appreciate that.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Terrible connectivity - hardly any noise cancellation,"These earbuds are garbage. The biggest issue is the connectivity consistently cuts out on the left earbud and often enough on the right as well. (phone pairs to right bud, then right pairs to left) If I have my phone in my pocket the sound cuts out, when I have it in my workout sleeve it cuts out, when I breathe it cuts out. I have my phone on my desk with these in as I type this and it's cutting out for no reason.

I didn't expect much noise cancellation given the price but I can hear someones conversation as clear as if I was just playing music next to me.  Avoid these at all costs. Just do yourself a favor and spend the extra cash on a decent pair.

I do find them comfortable and they stay in my ears while I run. So that's two positives.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Hooked up to tablet ,phone, bluetooth speaker or any device, they perform. Wife loves running with them (no wires).Get em !!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great True Wireless Earbuds for the Price...and FRUSTRATING!,"When I first got these earbuds, I was impressed. Setup was a breeze. Fit (once I found the right earpiece size, which was supplied in the packaging) is perfect. Sound controls were intuitive and easy to operate. Most importantly, though, I was really impressed with the sound quality. If you're looking for top of the line, best sound quality earbuds out there - these aren't for you. But if you're looking for good earbuds, with very good sound quality, and a fantastic price, well, now you know why I bought them.

So, why did I only give the earbuds two stars, you might be asking. They won't disconnect or turn off. Mine might be faulty, but they stay connected to my phone at all times - even when returned to their case for a recharge. Inside the case, they stay on until they've ran out the entire battery life of both the case and the earbuds. I expected once they were in the case and the case closed that the buds would turn off and disconnect from bluetooth, but so far, I've not been able to get them to do that. I have read and followed the instructions; and, like I said, perhaps mine are just faulty. But it's very frustrating.

I'll update this review if I figure out what's going on and determine it was user error, which could be the case. But, this ain't my first rodeo. :-|",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent value and great quality wireless earbuds,"I’ve used these for two days and so far, I’m very happy. The sound quality is great for music and spoken word.  The battery life is right in line with competitors, about 4 hours. I love the ability to recharge the case on a wireless charging pad or via usb. Noose cancelling is reasonably good, though I haven’t tried on a plane yet. The Bluetooth range for me has been about 10 feet.  In summary, I think these represent the best value in truly wireless earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left earbud keeps losing audio.,"The sound quality is amazing. Some of my friends say its better then Air Pods from apple. With that being said, my left one keeps losing sound as if it disconnects. I have to tap on it to get the sound back, then it goes out again and i keep having to tap on it. I mean I dont know if i got a bad one or what but its just the left side, the right one is always connected. Ill fix my ratings once I can get help from the support team!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product!,"A commuter’s perspective

I commute to and from Seattle for work using the train system so I rely heavily on music to make my experience a positive one. I had previously owned Apple airpods and had been looking for a better product when I came across these. It’s great that multiple earbud sizes come with this product because my ears aren’t evenly sized. They feel secure and the sound is much more enveloping than the Apple airpods. These wireless headphones are totally superior to the airpods: better battery life, better custom fit, more wholesome sound. They even work great as earplugs. The train station is a really loud place so these headphones have also been great to muffle the noise for ear protection. Taking phone calls are also very easy and so far I haven’t had any issues with static or failing parts. Great quality for the price. Wish I found them sooner!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not quite there,"I go through a lot of bluetooth earbuds like this model and these have been the least comfortable. They constantly fall out of my ears even during weight training. You can forget about it on a run. Sound quality is great. seem to be water tight, but too early to tell how they will stand up. I have to get another brand for my runs. the search continues.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good headphones, excellent customer service","UPDATED REVIEW: Tozo contacted me and sent me a new pair of headphones as well as a wireless charger to apologize for the defective pair I received.  Both work perfectly and their customer service was fantastic. Definitely recommend!

Original Review:
I really wanted these to work.  Unfortunately, the music kept stopping and starting, and then about 3 hours of sitting in my purse (maybe on, but not being used) they wouldn't turn on.  Additionally, the microphone sounded like I was speaking through a tunnel.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Update,"I received these recently and so far so good. They sound great I listen during workouts. They don't slip out. The range is pretty good you dont have to carry your phone in your pocket.  Overall a good experience thus far. Update: I really love these I didnt expect a $50 earbud to last this long. I like that you can use one at a time. The range is great, I walk around and no one thinks anything. My rating went from 4 to 5 nice product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Love them,I just got these and OMG they fit perfectly!! They don’t fall out of my ears and are SO lightweight it’s easy to forget they are there.  The sound quality is good but it cuts out abit if I shifted too much I still had perfect sound in the other bud.. so it wasn’t bad just minor.  I think it’s possible to reset them if this is a bother.  I like them and will likely be getting another set just so I can have them on for more of the work day and not have to wait while they charge.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Truly wireless bluetooth earbuds, never thought I'd see the day.","I've always listened to music my entire life, from cassette players, to cd, and finally apple products starting with the ipod Nano, over the course of all these devices there has been  one consistent issue, Headphone/Earbud Longevity, whether it's from me simply moving about as I listen to music, or perhaps it's from when you put your Headphones/Earbuds away in your pocket, bag, etc, but I've rarely ever have had a pair of either last more than three months or so, then come along bluetooth earbuds and it seemed like my issue was finally resolved, and while yes they did in fact last longer than earbuds and headphones connected to the device they still had the issue of a wire or cable connecting them which again lead to longevity issues, but now with these new earbuds that issue is a thing of the past, I'm allowed to move as freely as I want and I even have a perfect charging station/carry case for my earbuds that completely negates any potential wear and tear damage, so if you're looking for a pair of TRULY wireless earbuds then I highly recommend these, they're EXACTLY what i've been waiting for for YEARS and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase overall.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
IPX8 + Deep Bass!,"I was recommended this product by my co-worker, and I was a bit skeptical at first. First, I was unsure of the brand itself, and then I was unsure of the quality. However, I took a leap of faith, and ordered the earbuds. After receiving them, I charged the case/earbuds for 1 hour, and used them while I went out for a run. Generally, anything in ear tends to get sweaty and falls out for me, so I use over the ear, DJ style, headphones while I workout. These little buds stayed up, did not get sweaty, and the BASSS! The bass was deep, rich, and of some of the best quality i've ever heard in headphones/ear buds. I used to listen to music using August EP650 headphones, and i absolutely love those, but a little bit of moisture, and those would turn off. I went through my run, in light rain, wearing these buds, and they still work; thus the IPX8 rating checks out for now. I still want to test them while I swim in a pool. Overall, great little product, price point is unbeatable, the sleek design is enticing, and the noise cancellation is of decent quality for a product that doesn't even mention noise cancellation. DEFINITELY BUY THESE!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product!,Bought these for my son for his birthday.  He really likes them alot.  better than the last pair i bought from a different brand that was around the same price.  very easy to set up.  Sounds great! I would recommend these.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Surprisingly pleased,"I have to say I was a little hesitant at first buying anything other than market recognized brands but this did work well for me.

Pros:

* Very good comfort as sometimes I forget they are in my ears
* Very good sound quality. Even at 74% volume, I feel it's pretty high.
* Wireless charging is a huge plus. No one liked micro USB ports/ wires.
* Battery life has been great so far

Cons :

* There is a bit of lag when watching videos, esp fast paced. You can see that the sound you hear is sometimes not in sync with the video.
* Disconnecting from one device and connecting to another is sometimes frustrating that you have to put them back in the case and retrieve them with a new connection.

However, I don't see them as cons per se, since I normally listen to music and not watch too many videos, nor re-connecting to new device taking 5 more seconds out of my life a huge deal.

I had an issue with the microphone at first but powered down and back up on the individual earbuds, since then people can hear me fine.

For the price, I think its a solid deal.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
UPDATED: Bluetooth sucks.,"UPDATE: 9/10/19
SO BUMMED!! Love the features, the look and sound quality is great EXCEPT the left earbud, which only connects to the master right earbud, cuts out constantly! Sending them back and going to try a different Chinese no-name brand, or drop double the price for some decent quality.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I purchase a lot of things on Amazon, because if the product turns out to be a dud, Amazon is very good with returns. So, I took a chance on an obviously Chinese-based wireless earbuds manufacturer, since they had quite a few reviews and the features and design looked good. And the price was pretty good too, at around $50 USD.

These wireless earbuds have exceeded my expectations! Sound quality is strong, great low-end tones, very little distortion (and I only heard it at max volume listening to a bass-heavy song).

PROS:
-Good sound quality
-Charging dock uses wireless charging or USB
-Sturdy build, but comfortable
-Waterproof (good for sweat)

CONS:
-batter life was lacking. Mine died after about 2 hours of almost max volume use
-Lack functionality buttons. The single button on each earbud only paused/played, but didn't control volume or advance to next song (though, there might be more features to these buttons than I've figured out yet).

Overall - I would recommend! (NOT ANYMORE, SEE UPDATE)",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent sound.,"Excellent sound, easy pairing, comfortable, and doesn’t fall out while working out.  Drawbacks - only 2.5 hour battery life, and you can’t use the charging case as a portable power pack for charging other items in a pinch.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality,These ear buds are amazing! They have different fittings for your ear so they will not fall out and I’ve worked out in them before. The volume can get decently loud and the battery life is pretty good. I also had to go through customer service about some warranty questions and they were very helpful and so easily reached out to. I got a reply very soon after I sent the email and the representative helping me was very kind and helpful.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great purchase,"Great battery life.  They clearly label which headphone is which side, which makes pairing easier, too.  Noise cancelling for days; I can't even hear my girlfriend screaming at me when she's 2 feet away.  They stay in through a workout.  Good sound quality, but a bit heavy on the bass.  I would definitely recommend.  I wish the charging case was less bulky is all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I wear mine to run outside on the road - and have loved them,"I purchased my earbuds in January, 2019 and run outside nearly every day.  I link the earbuds with my FitBit and they've been great.  I actually purchased this pair because my plan was to use them swimming which I haven't done, however, like to have the confidence that they will not be damaged by sweat or rain.  And because I'm running outside on the road I like that I can still hear some traffic noise - but not excessive.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound...BUT,"I've had these for about a week and these definitely are not my 1st pair of wireless earbuds...

Pros:
1. Sound is good and unlike the wireless headphones that wrap around the neck, these have really good base

2. Not as sensitive to backround noise when talking on the phone.

Cons:
1. To change songs you HAVE TO take out your phone. These dont allow you to change songs any other way.

2. If you have 1 earbud in and decide to put the 2nd one in after say 10 minutes, it's a bitch to get both earbuds to play music.

3. People keep saying that I sound like I'm talking low when I'm on the phone.

4. At times it completely disconnects from my phone

5. The carrying case is pretty big, can be uncomfortable in pockets.

I'm returning these and ordering a different pair.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
THE BEST EARBUDS,"My husband ordered these for me since my iPhone started giving me problem with being able to hear callers. He ordered them got them a few days later charged them picked the smaller size ear caps that come with it. Once we paired them with the iPhone it was wonderful I could hear who I was talking to with no issues clear connection no interference at all.  Just turn them in your ear the way the instruction manual says you will no issues.
The price is also the best price!!! I just could not justify spending $145.00 for apple ipods.  These are one of the best ear buds out on the market.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Heaven in my ears!!!,"Buddy at work had these amdentiomes how well they blocked noise and that the bass was good too! Wow! 10 of us at work just moved into a communal open office. These ear buds block 85% of the loudest person and the bass is fantastic and and and they stay in my ears when doing any manner of CrossFit exercises. 4 hours battery life then a lunch break to charge, and then another 4 hours. These have been fantastic. And they handle phone calls really well with good audio too. We have a winner. Major big bang for buck.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Update to my original review to 5-stars,"I had originally given these earbuds a 2-star rating for the left earpiece losing connection to the right, primary, earpiece whenever I moved my head. Customer service reached out via email the next day apologizing for the poor performance and only asked for original order number so they could send another pair free of charge. I replied and received the second set the following day. I've been using these for the past couple of days and I can say that I""m impressed with the performance now. When I'm watching training videos and only using one piece, I'm using the left one and I'm not having any dropped connections to the primary. When at work I like to tune people out by listening to music and the sound quality is right up there with the more expensive headphones I use for gaming. 5-stars for customer service and 5-stars for how the product performs.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TOTALLY WASTED MONEY,"I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to review to give them a chance to work. They rarely worked at the same time. One ear would be on, the other not. Didn’t answer a call correctly. NOT a comfortable fit, tried out 3 sizes, and they still fell out on a WALK. and there was an odd static sound when no audio was being played. Gave them to my older son, he couldn’t find a correct fit for his ears and thought they were cumbersome. Too late to return, no one in the family wants them, so I am out $50+.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very good quality for the price you pay,"Everything works well, from easy bluetooth pairing to fine noise cancellation. These are good quality wireless headphones. The downside is that the sound will bounce around from left to right occasionally, which is a little bit bothersome.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fantastic product and here’s why,"I have had these for over two weeks and have had an amazing experience with them. Probably the only downfall is that when I eat they fall out sometimes, otherwise they stay put for hours on end. I haven’t tried the mic with calls with them so I can’t comment on the quality there but according the the comments I’ve seen the mic is really bad. Like I said I have no idea though. The bass is AMAZING. The sound quality definitely caters towards music. So if that’s why you’re buying them for they’re great.
Now to address some of the bad reviews I’ve seen; I have not had a single problem with disconnections. I can be on the second floor of the house and they still have perfect connection.
Now if you have one bud in and want to put the second one in as well, you will have to put both back into their case and start the connection over again. Otherwise you’ll only have audio in on bud.
TLDR; they’re great and I haven’t had a single complaint or problem with them :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The design is amazing,"Since the time that I took them out from the box, I felt in love immediately. The design and the lights that come from the earbuds really surprised me. I put them on to try the sound, and it was perfect they cover your ears completely and the experience is so comfortable and enjoyable. I don’t regret at all for buying them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Noise cancellation almost too good!,"These wireless bluetooth headphones are amazing. I was blown away the first time I popped them in and turned on some music and was instantly amazed by the sound quality and bass. I wish the battery life lasted a little longer though but it is what it is. I work in a warehouse setting with machinery and forklifts driving around so these headphones work great as an alternative to ear plugs with their noise cancellation. But it almost works too well, when both headphones are in I legitimately can't hear anything going on around me. Which is fantastic in other situations, so a positive and a negative depending on the situation. All in all, these are great headphones with great sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"I'd definitely recommend as a decently priced, waterproof, COMFORTABLE and nice sounding earbud.","The ear buds and the charging case they come in are great and customer service was the best experience I've ever had. They even emailed ME to make sure everything was up to par, which it was. The bass sounds awesome and the highs are crisp and possibly a little sharp but not enough to take away from the listener's experience. The waterproof rating is awesome so I can even listen to them in the shower if I wanted to. You won't find many with that high of a rating. Also, the charging case has the same waterproof rating of ipx8(just a little sidenote). They do have a nice Bluetooth range of 10 meters or about 36 feet and even at that distance it's still got a decent connection; any further and they will cut out too much. I found it interesting that when I was using the left earbud and had my phone with me, but the right earbud(the master earbud) was left in my room, the left would cut out until I was near the right one again even if I left my phone on the back porch. So the right earbud is the one that holds the connection, but you can still use each one individually, and the connection will be fine. I purchased the 3 year extended warranty without knowing the product comes with a 1 year extended warranty that is super easy to sign up for; just scan the QR code that comes in the package, which takes you to the website, enter in your amazon order number and that's basically it. They not only emailed me to make sure I was happy with their product, but they offered me a COMPLETELY FREE, no strings attached (no pun intended)wireless charger! That goes BEYOND customer service in my opinion. I'm glad I didn't order one beforehand(which I seriously contemplated). All in all they are a great sounding, comfortable set of waterproof earbuds with an excellent battery life, and the charging case doubles as a power bank to charge your phone. The 1 year extended warranty included is decent, and customer service is alone worth well more than the money you spend on this item, especially since they offered me the completely free wireless charger to make sure I'm happy. If you're interested in purchasing, just seal the deal. You WILL be happy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth the buy,"I am an avid runner and occasional gym goer so I've been in the market for a new pair of bluetooth headphones for a while. I was using the over-the-ear bluetooth Beats and they have been awesome but were a few years old. I came across these browsing one night and decided to purchase, they are way more affordable than the $250 Beats in-the-ear headphones. I've used them several times since I got them and have really enjoyed them. You could imagine my panic the other night when I realized I left them in my shorts pocket after the gym and had already washed AND dried my clothes! I just knew they would be ruined. I expected them to either not work at all or to sound like someone was singing underwater. To my surprise, they still worked perfectly! I've used them about 3 times since then and haven't had any issues so I'd say they are worth the buy!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible sound,"These earbuds are surprisingly great quality for such an affordable price. Unfortunately, mine stopped charging, but I was able to contact seller for free warranty replacement with no hassle.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Worth the cost of name brand, better quality, and cheaper","These earbuds have already really impressed me, I had been trying to find a good pair of truly wireless earbuds and looked at JBL, Bose, and scull candy and all of the reviews were very sub par and if I was going to pay anywhere from $100-200 for earbuds I wanted them to be quality. I found these on Amazon because they were very highly rated and had over 8000 reviewers, me at others had 100 reviewers at best. I assumed with that many positive reviews they must be doing something right so I picked these up for $50 and it was a great decision.

The packaging was very high quality, well protected and packed, free 1 year extended warranty right at the front of the box. These were super intuitive and worked right out of the box, both the earbuds and the case had charges, the buds paired without problem with each other and almost as easily with my phone. I love that when I pull these out of the case they turn on and shut off when I put them back, they automatically pair with each other when I pull them both out. Another feature that makes these an absolute winner is that they can be paired separately. I wear these a lot when working and in an industrial environment you always have to be able to hear what is going on around you. It takes a minute for the individual bud to stop searching for it's pair but when it's done it works flawlessly, I can also pair the left separate so I can use one untill the battery runs out and then swap. I used just one for close to 8 hours only throwing it back in the case for 15 minutes at a time while I was on break. I was able to walk upto 50 feet away with no dropping or sound degradation, I did have some drops with it in my back pocket but for the most part there has been no issue.

They also fit very well, I use the smallest buds and they fit snug and secure and don't fall out while I'm moving around.

The sound is really good quality, I hate earbuds that give that flat and hallow sound and these aren't anywhere close to that, they may not be concert quality but it sounds good in every range, the bass is really good and you can definitely feel it. They put out solid volume so I can rock out when I want and they seal well and keep out most ambient sounds even at lower volume.

So far I have no real complaints and would highly recommend picking up these over spending significantly more on worse quality buds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Worth it!,"I received my earbuds yesterday and immediately put them to work. I paired with three devices, MacBook, iPhone and iPad Pro. The MacBook had a little “dead spot” when I would turn my head but my Mac is older. No issues with other two devices. I made several phone calls, listened to music and even took a shower:) while listening to music from iPhone. Sound is great, the medium size cups worked for my ear holes. Price for these earbuds was fine with me.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great idea...but doesn't actually stay secure,I love the idea of these earbuds and really wanted them to work. I tried all of the rubber pieces.

Sound quality I would rate up there with most top brands such as Bose, JBL, etc. fit and finish are excellent and love how the case can be charged with a Qi charging pad. Not to mention it makes a cool evil robot face:-) overall surprised and satisfied with this purchase. These were better than my Motorola verve one earbuds. I would recommend you give these a try.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bang for your hard-earned bucks.,"I have these paired to an iPhone 8+. You can use them individually if you pair each one to your phone. After the simple initial pairing process these will auto-pair to your phone but it will take up to a minute to do automatically. It isn’t a problem but is longer than most people are use to waiting. The sound quality is phenominal even out of the box for what you are paying for. I have had earbuds from klipsch that are on par that cost a lot more. The buds are comfortable and come with four sizes of gummies to fit your ear. They are capable of being really loud so beware. Once fitted properly, it’s rare I ever go above sixty percent volume. I like a fairly natural sound because I listen to many different type of music. I don’t need to use the Apple ear for anything I listen to with the T10s. They make everything I listen to sing. They have definitely made a fan of me. They are great in the shower as well. I like the fact that you can charge the case wirelessly on a Qi pad or with the included micro usb cable. It’s always nice to have options.If you choose to give these a try, I think you will be hard- pressed to find a pair that beats them at even twice or three times the cost.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound,"I have enjoyed my set so far.  They were easy to pair to my phone.  Looks great and fits well.  Quick recharging time as well.  The only thing I have found so far is that you cannot pair them individually.  I only listen with my right bud because I have it in at work.  I can't use both at the office.  So when the right one dies, I cannot cycle to the left bud only.  Also, my package didn't come with the different size silicone ear canal things to swap out.  Thankfully, the size that came on them work okay.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the Price Point,"I was very satisfied with the battery life and sound quality of the earbuds.

Great value earbuds,"This is a great pair of earbuds for the following reasons:
1. Easy setup - I plugged them into my ears and it recongnized and connected right when I touched on the bluetooth
2. Good sound quality - The sound is great. The bass is great. Satisfactory.
3. Comfortable fitting - No problem w the earbuds staying in my ears.
4. Great price - there are not a lot out there with this price and this value. I recommend this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Convenient to use, and great quality for the price","UPDATE: I put these through the wash, and they STILL WORK.  Did not expect something at that price point to actually be fully waterproof.

I have used these earbuds far more than any other earphones I have owned.

1. These earbuds definitely block sound, which is great for indoor workouts, but I wouldn't say it's great for ""sport"" or outdoor runs.  You really can't hear anyone speaking to you or cars coming up behind you.
2. Super convenient to carry around due to the small charging/carrying case.
3. Great battery life.  I occasionally place the charging case on the wireless charger built into my Toyota Tacoma and I haven't had to worry about the battery since I purchased them - the earbuds are always fully charged!
4. No more messing with wires or holding a button for 3-5 seconds to turn them on.  Remove them from the case and pop them in your ears, and it takes about 2 seconds to turn both L and R on, and about 5-15 seconds to connect automatically (after you connect to the phone the first time) to your Bluetooth device.  When you are done, don't mess with turning them off - just plop them back into the case and let it close with a satisfying magnetic snap.
5. They are light enough that I can't get them to fall out, even if I shake my head really hard.  However, if you already have wet ears from showering or sweating, they do slip out a bit so the sound quality suffers.  That is an issue with any earbud that does not have extra ear support.
6. I accidentally field tested the waterproofing quality after dropping one in the shower.  It smacked onto the metal and got pretty submerged for a second (about as long as it takes to swear twice), but they still work great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great design, faulty execution","These headphones are great in concept.  They are completely wireless, pairing to each other and the device.  They have a storage container that serves as storage and the charging station (and has a small internal battery so you can charge the headphones while away from home) which is handy and eliminates the need to charge them independently or with a cord.  They have a pretty good range and sound quality.

However, about a week after receiving my headphones the left one stopped working.  I'm not sure if the charging stopped or if there was some other issue.  It won't charge in either the right or left slot of the docking station so it's definitely the headphone itself that is defective.  I still use the right headphone when I'm working out or on my commute, but given the price I would definitely look for another product.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bang for your buck!,"These headphones are pretty good! The high and mid range sound is nice and clear, the bass is very nice as well, not too much, not too little, nice and lightweight design! Perfect for any occasion! 10/10 recommend getting these headphones!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"I really wanted these to work for me, but...","They fit great, the battery life was good and they sounded fine... But the signal would drop constantly. I'm pretty sure that most of the issue was caused by interference from other Bluetooth devices within about 10 feet. For example, I'd have terrible connectivity problems if I had my Fitbit Charge 2 on my wrist. It would get worse if I raised my hand above chest level and got it more than about 18 inches from the headphones. I'd get pretty good connections if I was alone in my house, but forget about walking around outside or in an office setting. I live in San Francisco, and the streets are crowded with tons of people - and I noticed that if anyone with iPhone Bluetooth ear buds got within about 10-feet of me, I'd lose first the left ear, then the right. It would clear up about 3 seconds later after I'd passed the 20-foot mark away from the other Bluetooth user. This left me feeling certain that the problem was with interference from other Bluetooth devices. For the way I intended to use these earphones, that just wouldn't cut it. I've returned them after two weeks of trying to make them work and I'll be replacing them with something else.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Do not hesitate to buy! They are worth it.,"The fit and finish is great on these ear buds. They are sleek, non intrusive, and they sound great for their price! I’ve had many others, and am a bit picky on earbuds but these meet and exceed my requirements! The sound is rich. The battery life is long, the charger is handy, and the different size ear pieces make it customizable to fit anyone’s ears. I would totally buy these again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Super nice headphones.,"These headphones have superb bass sound. I knew it said they did, but when I turned them on the first time, I was blown away. I didn't expect them to have near what they did. I've tried at least five different earphones/earbuds and none (not even the Apple pair that came with an iPhone and was ruined after going through the washer) had near as good as bass. The only problem is my phone. It recently started pairing all Bluetooth devices as [name unknown]. Also, I'm not sure if it's my phone or the earbuds, the left earbud will cut out every five seconds sometimes. This only happens every once in a while and I found that pausing the music with the earbuds, waiting about three seconds, and then playing the music again will stop the cutting out. One theory I have is that my phone has version 3.0 Bluetooth and these earbuds have version 5.0. But overall, these earbuds are very durable, waterproof (unlike the Apple ones), and have superb bass. To use them is also very simple. Once they are paired with your phone, simply turn them both on, (or take them out of the charging case, they turn on automatically) let them connect with each other, and then the right earbud will connect with your phone. Then let bass rumble! You can also use just one of the earbuds if you want too, although you don't as good of sound. When I use these earbuds, I turn the volume on my phone clear down to 1 as the buds are quite loud and cancel sound very well. With the volume on 1 in a quiet room, I can't hear a person talking to me from three feet away AT ALL. This also saves your phone battery as it doesn't have to create as strong of a signal. I do wish they wouldn't cut out though. Also, the case won't take a charge from most charging cables, however, it works with some cables. Still, the seller is so nice, he's going to send me a free wireless charger. By the way, he offered to send me one before I told him my case wouldn't charge. That's what you call customer service! It came the other day. It's worth $20. And they sent it completely free. Works awesome, the only down thing is, my phone doesn't support wireless charging. :) Altogether, they get a five-star rating.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product ...even in desert heat,These earbuds are amazing quality for an amazing price. They have great sound quality and are very comfortable. I've tried cheap bluetooth headphones with wires and hated how they got tangled and caught in everything.  I've tried expensive ones such as Beats by Dre and Bragi...these beat them at an incredible price. Live in the Southwest USA...VERY HOT...and with heat they work great...even when I am sweating buckets. Excellent value!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great Design! Great Sound! Great Value!,"I had considered several different brands of Bluetooth wireless headphones, but after comparing prices and reading the reviews I decided to go with the TOZO T10.
The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the elegant design of the product.  They paired to my iPhone easier than any previous device!

Well worth the money!!,"I was really impressed my this product. The charging case is sturdy and the top opens all the way. Comes with 3 sets of ear buds. I had a hard time finding the right set at first but once I figured out the proper way to wear them. They are awesome. Great sound for the price. I usually buy a pair of wired set every week so I am excited to get these. I put a clip on the charging box and wear it on my short loop so I have a constant way to charge for all day use

"No Joke, these are THE BEST I EVER HEARD","THIS IS AN ENTHUSIASTICALLY WRITTEN POSITIVE REVIEW!
Usually when Amazon or a seller asks me for a review about an item I purchased, I tend to accommodate them even if my opinion was less than stellar. I'll tell the truth about my likes and dislikes so that others could make a more informed decision about the item.
I've tried so so many earbuds over the years. They would either not fit well, fall out, sound brash with too much high end / no low end, get uncomfortable after a very short time, etc., I NEVER found earbuds that were satisfactory, let alone excellent. Once these earbuds are placed in the ear canal, I feel like I can use a trampoline and they'll still stay in. Not only that, the sound is AMAZINGLY GOOD. No kidding. I'm a lifelong musician and hate listening to music that is badly reproduced by crappy audio equipment. These buds provide a strong punchy bass, nice separation and the mids and highs are just about perfect. Seriously, you don't know me but take my word on this. This review has been a pleasure to write. It's honest and gratifying to think that someone might buy these buds because of this review.  I really think you'll be pleased with them. These earbuds are INEXPENSIVE AND FAR SUPERIOR  to anything I've tried in the past. I highly recommend buying them before they become TOO desirable and expensive :) PS: They are also the simplest earbuds to pair and connect to a source.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Large and in charge,"I’m not an audiophile by any means so for me, these sound great. They get pretty loud without the volume being turned all the way up.

Unfortunately, I was looking for earbuds that fit flush into my ear and doesn’t make me look like an early model cyberman. These are def not it. They are humongous! They look like they’re literally falling out of my ear and I have to readjust them often to make sure they stay in.  The charging case is very good quality but that is also extremely large.

Every now and then, the sound on the left ear bud would also cut out when I’m walking even with my phone in my hand.

These would honestly be such a good buy if only it weren’t so conspicuous.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, charging, pairing, fit.","Very happy with these so far, I work in an open office environment that is loud so these drown that out, sound great when playing music, and can take phone calls seamlessly. The pairing is easy every time, I don’t run but am pretty active at work and walk an industrial environment many times daily and haven’t had issues with them falling out. The charging case works great and charges wirelessly smoothly. No complaints.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Shocked at how disappointed I am,Shockingly disappointed in these. Had so many great reviews but after having worn them twice- I’ll probably never wear them again. Work okay in the ear when you’re dry and not really moving but even when I was putting on my makeup I had to readjust them a couple of times. Then I got home from work and decided to put them on in the shower bc they’re waterproof and I’m pretty sure the ear piece tried to suck my tympanic membrane out of my ear canal. Yes these are waterproof. No they do not stay in your ear when wet and if you try to push them back in while wet it creates a suction cup (that only lasts a second and then they fall out again) to your ear canal and it hurts horribly. So no I don’t recommend these to anyone and I should have just spent the money and gotten AirPods,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Meh... Not great not bad...,I really like the quality however the beeping when you only pair 1 earbud is super annoying & it seems to be no way to turn it off after it beeps intermittently for a few mins. Other than that the bluetooth seems to disconnect after a while during phone calls,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These Headphones Make Everything Easier!,"I love these headphones. I just got them a few days ago to replace my current workout headphones which were just the Apple brand corded kind. I was looking for a good sound quality and a great ability to stay in as well, and found both in these.

Tozo Customer Service is GREAT!!!  T10 ear buds are also great.,"Tozo Customer Service is very responsive. I emailed with an issue and received a response in less than 12 hours. Tozo went above and beyond my expectations.

The left earbud fell out of my ear while I was aggressively running on a treadmill.  Don't worry, they stay in but I was really pushing it for awhile.  The treadmill sucked up the earbud and the gym was unwilling to take 4 screws out of the cover to retreive my lost earbud. I emailed Tozo with my situation, wishing to purchase a replacement left earbud.  They informed me that they do not sell single units but would send me a FREE replacement earbud which arrived within a week. I did experiance a pairing issue with the new earbud. I sent another email to customer support on a weekend and received a response within 15 hours. Problem solved in 5 minutes.

The T10's are everything advertised and the price is great. I love the waterproof feature and the wireless charging case with a lanyard.  Bass is good and the sound is clear and adequate even in a noisy gym environment.

You can't go wrong purchasing the Tozo T10's and if there is a problem, Tozo Customer Service work to make you happy. A great product at a great price with customer service to back it up.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great buy at this price. I love them.,"Very good earbuds for this price point!!! The second I took them out of the charging case the synced with each other, my cellphone found the Bluetooth signal and I was using them!! I like that the volume control is on my cellphone because past earbuds with onboard volume control would fall out when I tried to adjust the volume. These are sturdy, well made earbuds and the charging case is not only closed magnetically, but it’s see through so you can see the blue charge level lights and the earbuds lights through the lid. I’ve gotten almost five full charges from the case before I had to recharge it. I’m very glad I purchased these earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds,I really like these earbuds. They are easy to pair to my phone. They stay in my ears (especially after using the correct earbud size) and the batteries seem strong. The case is very durable and charges easily by just plugging the USB to a computer. It can also be charged wirelessly; you have to buy the wireless charger separately though. The sound is awesome; you can hear the bass! The microphone is powerful. You don't have to speak loud to be heard during phone conversations. It's a good earbud to buy.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Was good but then...,"I really enjoyed these the first day I used them but then out of nowhere they got really quiet. Yes, both earbuds were connected and producing sound. I'm disappointed that this happened because they are overall great earbuds. I like the design and the sound quality. I hope that I can figure this issue out myself, or I'll contact Tozo and try to get a replacement. I still would recommend these because you get a one year warranty.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great solid wireless pair for the price,I’ve had these for a month and I’ve now passed the honeymoon phase. Definitely recommend them BUT as someone who uses them exclusively at the gym they seem to be cutting out more from the left and right ear which is annoying. Less important is the range truly isn’t long. If there’s a wall between you and your phone you’ll hear a lot of breaking up but most people will have their phone just a few feet away. If price is important as it was for me I’d say go for them. Might upgrade in a few months however.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Finally found my earbuds!,"They have only been in use for a short time, but they have become my ""trusted partner"" for my morning walk. I am now able to listen to podcasts without the distraction of street sounds. Those sounds are muffled so still able to maintain the stroll in safety.

Worked as advertised right out of the box and delivered amazing sound. Almost as good as my $300 BT headphones!
Added bonus: the fit is so good that it sounds like active noise cancelling. When I first tried them in my noisy office environment I had to go back and read the product page on Amazon again to see if I'd missed a part about noise cancelling.

Great deal for the price,"These earbuds are not perfect, but given the cost, they are well worth it, especially compared to AirPods. I was considering getting AirPods but was turned away by the price, so I got these instead. The sound quality is good, nothing amazing, but honestly there's nothing to complain about, especially when you can wear these wireless. It's just a compromise you have to make, and it's a good compromise. The earbuds fit very nicely, don't fall out, and aren't very noticeable when wearing.

"Solid, but the range is not quite great for lots of movement","These are pretty solid, if the bluetooth range to the device was better, these would be the best head phones I have ever purchased. The batterylife is pretty good, the only think that stinks is the headphones won't work if the case is out of battery when you pull them out.

The range worked okay the first day, then when I put my phone in my pocket to go for a run, the sound kept going in and out. I took my phone out of my pocket and it was fine again, and if my phone was in my pocket upside down it wasn't as bad. Seems to me it needs a direct line of connection with nothing blocking the connection (my arms while running or the bottom of my pocket when it was right side up).

I use them with my laptop and they work fine, but I do not run with them in anymore.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product.,Ok. Overall for the money this product is amazing. Sound quality is great. And the noise cancelling is leaps and bounds better than air pods. They stay seated in my ears even when I’m riding my motorcycle. Which was what I was worried about. They pair with each other very easily. And the manufacturers are really friendly.  The charging case works top notch. And I love the wireless charging. Im able to set the case down when I get home and at night and it’s ready to go in the morning. Overall great product. Highly recommended,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Other brands have better features, but if it’s sound quality you’re after, get these","I go through a LOT of headphones/earbuds as I’m always looking for the perfect pair.
These wireless earbuds get a 4-star rating because of the sound quality and waterproof rating.  For me, the sound is superb, rivaling my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.  I will say though, they have a heavy base, that I love, but is not for everyone.

Pros:
The audio quality is excellent!
Battery life is in line with other wireless earbuds of its category
It has a substantial battery in the case (for charging multiple times without being plugged in)

Cons:
It has nearly zero control features (pause and redial) - not having AT LEAST track forward/track back and volume is a big miss
*On this point, my Apple watch acts as the remote for the music

Meh:
I’ve tried all of the different sizes of buds and the earbuds tend to come loose from my ears without a lot of movement - I have not given up on this, though
As is the common practice with these types of earbuds, the right ear connects to the sound source (ex. IPhone) and the left ear bud connects to the right ear bud.  It’s a minor gripe, but the left earbud will go silent (for just a fraction of a second) when I tilt my head.  I sent my first pair back because it was doing this at almost any head movement.  The vendor was very responsive and replaced them.  My 2nd pair still does it, but not nearly as badly as the first.
The bluetooth range on these is not great, and requires an unobstructed line of sight (does not pass through walls well).  Again, this is minor, and I suspect it’s due to the size of the parts.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Incredible ear buds for the dollar,All around amazing ear buds. I use them for everything but mainly mowing and they block noise very well. Battery life is excellent. Sound is clean and crisp.

"Not bad for the price, but a couple of flaws","Product works fairly well, and the sound is better than I expected, but....

First, the screening on the product is ridiculous.  You need a flashlight and your reading glasses to figure out which piece is labeled R and which is L.  If they just colored the tubes differently the issue would be solved.

Second, the reception range on them is sub-par.  With my phone in a pocket the sound frequently drops out.  I have to walk with the phone in my hand for a steady signal.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best bang for your hard earned $$$!,"After an unfortunate incident with our washing machine, I had to replace my beloved Bose ear buds.

They are easy to pair with your device, sound quality is second to none with a range of crisp clear highs and mids and real clean deep bass you just don’t find in many other earbuds. In my experience, you get in the ballpark of 4-5 hours battery life. The case is also your wireless charging station with its own internal battery.

I listen to online music - Pandora, Tunein, etc- when I use these headphones. I'm pretty particular about headphones, when it comes to sound quality. I like a full range sound, not muffled and solid bass. These have great bass, without being overpowering and clear highs. It usually takes me about 60-90 minutes to finish the yard so no issues with battery life.
I did keep track of battery life the last time that I used them. They lasted right at 3.5 hours of continuous use. I rated these at 5 stars for battery life because that is what they were advertised to last.
Connecting to the phone was easy and wireless charging worked flawlessly. There are 4 blues lights on the case that let you know the charge level of the case. They are visible through the case lid when it's closed. I've used both a Samsung wireless phone charger and an Anker charger to wirelessly charge the case.
For the price, these are a awesome buy. Now, I look forward to doing yard work. Ok, not really but it gives me an excuse to use these headphones.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Outstanding! Very comfortable and great sound quality!,"I love these earbuds so far! Very comfortable, actually stay in your ear I train with them in everyday and literally have not fallen out once. Also comfortable to wear at night. I had a pair that went over the ear and were bulky so they would hurt my ear if laying on my side. With these, you can lay on your side and you can’t even feel them in your ear. 100% worth the buy! Battery has lasted 5 hrs straight so far. The charging station is also a battery. So once it’s fully charged you can take with you and charge earphones without a cord.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fine but don't fit my ear,"I gave them four stars because the only thing against them is that I can't wear them. The sound is fine, I also wanted them for their color so they are less obvious in my ears.  I have small ear canals and even with the smallest buds on them they are too tight to be comfortable for me.  I'm sure they would be fine for anyone that doesn't have this problem. I have to return them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left side cuts out,Works good and sounds good most the time but seems like when I use it in the gym left earbud cuts out and only works half the time very frustrating!  Don’t know if it’s from all the metal equipment or if there’s multiple frequencies going on with other wireless air buds but I can’t use them at the gym !,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exceeded all expectations,"Amazing. Fantastic sound, comfortable fit, charging case comes with them, and the right bud is clickable to pause/ play. This is my first set of wireless earbuds and good god...I’m super impressed. The quality for the price really shocked me. I expected them to be about as comfortable as Apple’s, but no. These put Apple’s to shame and they’re  the same price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Work great, strong customer service and support","These work really well, though for people new to Bluetooth headphones like me, there is a bit of a learning curve (since charging headphones isn’t  something I was used to). That said, they work really well, and my kids are always trying to steal them, which is a very good sign about the product. Their customer service and support is excellent as well.  Somehow I was thinking they had a built-in microphone, which they do not, but that’s my mistake.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality great price!,"I was not sure what to expect when I ordered these, but I was willing to give an unknown brand name a shot since I’m not willing to drop a Costco trip worth of money on wireless headphones(AirPods) and I wasn’t disappointed, the packaging was great, the sound quality is surprisingly adequate and the setup was so easy. I like the look and ease of them and they provide you an additional one year no questions asked warranty when you register them. I used them in the rain and had no problems. I recommend them!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely Phenomenal must buy,"These head phones are great quality for the price. The packaging is quality, the sound is quality, the carving case for the ear buds.

After pushing them in I realized they sounded great.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome quality at a great price 👍,"My wife and I both have a pair of the T10s I also have a set of the T6.
The T10s are comfortable once you figure out the right size ear plugs to use. It comes with 4 sets of rubber tips. The more snug the fit the better the sound.
The sound quality it great once you have the right fit. I pair them with my phone to listen to music. The sound is great and the bass is punchy.
The Bluetooth connection is solid.
The battery life of both the ear buds and the charging case are great.
TOZO's customer service is also very good.
Over I'm very satisfied with the quality of the T10s especially considering the price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent Sound Quality for Price,"I've used these wireless headphones for a while now and mostly during work. They provide great quality sound comparable to my previous $100+ headphones and have that deep bass that I was searching for. I love the base as you can charge it on your charging base and is waterproof. Overall, its great value for the price and I did not have any issues.

Recommendation: Solid buy for the price

Pros:
- Excellent sound quality
- Focus on deep bass
- Wireless charging for entire pod
- Waterproof
- Great battery life
- Comes with extra ear plugs for replacement
- 1 year warranty

Cons: None",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than I Thought!,"My brother got these for my birthday. I didn't expect much from them since they were so cheap. However, these earbuds blew me away with the sound quality for the price. I used it for my whole trip in Europe. The battery life is pretty amazing as i never ran out of juice in the day. When i got back home, I bought another one of these for my father's birthday. I really recommend if you're looking for amazing quality bluetooth earbuds that are not apple or samsung.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Absolutely Amazing!,"So I am an Apple person right, however I could not afford to buy Apple  AirPods and was also not very impressed with the sound and design for the cost Apple had these wireless headphones. So, needless to say I began my search for other earbuds and found these. I trusted the other reviews and purchased them and not only did they arrive the SAME DAY I ordered them, but they are amazing!! I struggled at first putting them in and having them sit comfortably but then saw a note that said there were extra ear plug sizes. I found the right one for me and honestly have enjoyed the loud, noise cancelling sound of these headphones. They remind me of beats with the great quality sound they provide. AND it comes with a FREE 1 year warranty! I totally recommend!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fits my small ear canal,"I usually have a problem finding devices that fit in side my ear comfortably. Most are too large. I was worried the earbuds would not stay in but they do.

Good sound quality and fit,"Great in ear headphones. They block out sound pretty well. Lots of bass. This means the highs are less than stellar, but when you buy for bass at this price, it is to be expected.

These are Excellent Ear Buds!,"I wanted to try them out for awhile before posting a review and I must say that these ear buds are outstanding. First of all the sound quality is really good. I have had some ear buds in the past where you could hear some whitenoise in the background, especially at higher volume, but these have a really crisp and clear sound. Secondly, is they stay in your ears. I have had problems in the past with ear buds falling out of my ears, especially when jogging, but these stay in really good. Also, since they are waterproof, you can just rinse them under the hydrant when you get through with your workout and that keeps them really clean. I would highly recommend this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great sound and quality for the price!,"I bought these after seeing great reviews on Amazon, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. Right out of the box, the setup was easy, and the sound is very good, for a set of buds in this price range. I love the charging case, too. Great quality all around. I'd definitely recommend. One note: the left ear bud might be a bit static until you do a full reset of both buds. Easy and fast. Not sure why this is needed, but it fixed the only issue I had.

Worth it,"Really enjoying these! Battery life seems great, haven't had to charge them yet.  I can get a pretty good distance from my phone. I use these at work (in a library) and am able to make it about halfway across our building.
I changed the ear pieces to find ones that fit and they have never fallen out. I listen to these almost the entire work day (6-8 hours) and have no issues with them falling out or disconnecting. Sound quality is fantastic. I had no trouble connecting the first time, and they connect automatically to my note 8 when taken out of the case! Definitely worth the purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Quality, Great Features & Great Price!","I've been using them about a week now, and they are amazing. They fit like a glove with the soft gel like silicone earpieces. There are also four different size ear pieces to ensure a good fit.
Listening to music the sound quality is amazing. On calls the sound quality is amazing, unfortunately you do have to speak in a high normal voice when you're in the public situation, but that's to be expected when there is no boom mic.
They charge quickly in the magnetic docking station, so the earbuds don't fall out if the docking station is open. The docking station can be recharged by micro USB or wireless charger, which is great as it charges quickly as well. The docking station will recharge they are buds for well more than a day's worth of use.
I love them and would highly recommend them great quality and value.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great set of earbuds,"I am very happy with this purchase.  I took my time searching Amazon for the right pair, as for me the size and weight were very important, I did not want a set of ear buds which stick out of my ears.  T10 are very compact and light while delivering an outstanding sound, the fact they are water proof is an extra bonus for me.  The build quality is very good, each ear bud sits firmly in it's position in the charging case held by a magnet, and LED indicating lights let you know exactly when they are charged.  The fit is very good and the ear buds come with multiple sets of ear pieces which ensure a great fit.  Once I settled on my size ear pieces they held my ear buds in place and I have not had any issues of them falling out.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wonderful Sound and Fantastic Design,"After returning a different pair of wireless earbuds, TOZO's were the next on my list of bluetooth buds to try. Once I recieved them and put them on, I knew they were on a different playing field. When it comes to a good fit, they shine. I use the smallest size of insert and after following the given instructions, they felt right at home, barely budging and inch with vigorous head weaving and bobbing. Thankfully, this fit is not the only going for these bad boys. The sound is fantastic. Paired with the more than decent sound cancelling, the bass packs a punch I didn't think was possible on bluetooth buds like these. The depth of sound going on here is not to be passed up. I'm no expert on sound specs and quality, but I do know what sounds good, especially for the price that these TOZO buds are at. The pairing, after getting conifgured on my phone, works quickly and efficiently. The range on the bluetooth is quite good. I have yet to run into any connection problems with these buds. The battery life is just right. While I haven't driven them dry from a full charge, they shoe great promise for someone who doesn't intend to wear them every moment of the day. The charger is a nice shape, featuring simple to understand LED charge-level lights. Having the ability to wirelessly charge makes battery life a non-problem.

Overall, I love these things. The ergonomic design might produce some soreness if worn for longer than a few hours, but which earphones won't do that? Give these ear phones a chance. I'm sure they won't dissappoint.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great bass sound and they stay in your ear!,"For the price, you can't beat these ear buds. I was surpised that they fit very well and literally could not come out on their own.  Great bass as advertised but keep in mind you should select the right size ear bud cushions first before adjusting your sound on your phone or whatever device you use them for. The second to smallest size cushions were on when I opened the package and after pairing them to my phone, the bass was barely there. I adjusted my EQ to full base and it helped a little. Then I tried on the best cushions which ended up being the laregest ones and best fit AND full deep base. I had to go back an adjust EQ bass down.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product! Must buy!,"This is a high-quality product for the price, and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for sound quality, comfort, and looks.

No issues pairing them to my iPhone, noise cancellation is great, and sound and connectivity with phone calls (sending and receiving) have been on point.

Very happy with it, I have already recommended it to many at work and they have purchased the item since they saw first-hand that it is quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fit's better than you might expect,"I received these on 4-6-2019  and I've had them about 5 days. Let me say first that for 50 dollar in ear headphones they sound great. A little heavy on the bass, but still better than I expected. The battery life so far has been about 4 hours for each one listening to a mix of podcasts music and phone calls and the charger seems to get about 2 1/2 charges before needing recharging itself. They come with several sets of tips, so you probably won't find that to be an issue as far as fit goes. If you have trouble getting them to stay in, remember to stick them in and twist toward the back of your ear until your ear acts as a brace. Mine haven't fallen out since I started doing that. All in all I'm a very satisfied purchaser at this point. I'll update this review if anything changes.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Nice earbuds with a caveat,"These sound surprisingly good for being non-HD Bluetooth and having a traditional driver. The pairing is pretty easy and the charging case is pretty nice too. The issue I am having is that the left unit drops out periodically. I have tried re-setting their connection and removing/re-adding them to my phone. It almost seems like there is a vacuum sensor that mutes the device when an air pressure change occurs since it seems to happen with yawning/coughing and other actions that would change the pressure between the driver and eardrum. If this could be resolved, I'd give them 5 stars for their class of buds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good, but not the best.","My earbuds only came with the covers that were attached, which were extra large. I need the small, which is bad that I needed to buy some to use these. The sound quality is good, not a lot of bass as advertised, but fine for use. Also, if you intend to swim in these, don't buy these. If you go under water at all they do not work. These are more for sitting on the side of a pool and then getting slightly wet, but not for swimming.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Nice Sound, but they fall out","Pros

Sound quality is good, much better than the airpods I used to have.
Relatively inexpensive
Cons
They fit well when dry, but continually fell out of my ears when running, working out, etc. upon sweating.

The size of the earbuds they came with were optimal (the others either too small or too big).  It may be that anatomy of my ears are not conducive to these types of headphones (the airpods were much worse).  I went to the airpods as my plantronic fit headphones battery was wearing out after 7 years.  Just found out that the plantronic fits are on sale at Costco, so I will go back to wearing this type of wireless headphone.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not bad,Not a bad set of Bluetooth headphones. They don't hold a charge all day but will for a few hours. Easy to use and sync. They do cancel out noise quiet well. I can't hear people talking to me. The box holds a charge for a day or so. Haven't waited to see how long. Not a bad set. I haven't tried anything with water so I can't review for that. I was not given a deal to do a review either.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Issues with my earbuds,"I'm having issues with my left earbud no longer syncing up with my right. When I pick the left earbud up from the charging case and put it on it will say, ""Power On"" Before beeping twice and attempting to pair on its own without connecting automatically to the right earbud. I've attempted everything I could, turning them off, resetting them, putting them back in the charging case for extended periods of time.

I actually really enjoy this product and how easy it is to use, and I've purchased the wireless charging pad to go with it, I'm just having this one really obnoxious issue that's preventing me from using it further. Any helpful tips?",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wireless Sonic Freedom!,"Took a chance on the Tozo T10 Waterproof Wireless Earbuds and must say I'm very impressed. Out of the box they quickly and very easily paired with my iPhone 8. Sound quality is rich and full, with great bass response. They fit comfortably and snugly in my ears, once I switched to the large ear caps. They're packaged with four sets of varying size ear caps, a mini USB charge cable and nice lanyard. The included charge box, like the ear buds themselves, seems very-well constructed, has a magnetically secured lid and charges via USB, or the separately available wireless charging pad. The overall charge box dimensions are 1.34""H x 1.74""W x 3.62""L (34mm x 45mm x 92mm) . So far I'm very satisfied with this product!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product,"Am impressed with the TOZO T10. The product quality is top notch, and lots of features for the price. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and Bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.

Pairing them with my MACPRO was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing. The Bluetooth v5.0 has a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and up to 25 feet away an still connected. The sound clarity and the bass are of the richest quality level of the top end earbuds. The earbuds and the case are extremely water resistance from the description on the packaging, still yet to find out. I found out that I could use the product for about or over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. The Qi wireless charging case is very handy.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
AirPods? Who needs AirPods?,"This is my second pair of TOZO ear buds. I had the T-8 before, and this is a definite step up. I only replaced the T8 because I lost one. TOZO earbuds work seamlessly with my iPhone. Syncing is never a problem. I like that you pick them up out of the charger and they automatically turn on and pair. These earbuds have a great sound with deeper base than anything I’ve heard except my noise-canceling OTE headphones. They are sturdy and well built but not bulky in my ear. I am often asked about them and my answer is always the same: a much cheaper option than AirPods but a high quality too.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Long distance waterproof earbuds,"Cool earbuds, wireless, waterproof and the case charges them!  So you can go for a trip and have your case charged up and give u a few rounds of use.

Being waterproof you could keep your phone away from the water and still listen to your music... really neat!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best? Probably not.  Worth the money YES,"I have only used these for a total of probably 10 hours in the first week of owning them.

TOZO sends and email promising a free wireless charger for leaving a review.  The email doesn't say it has to be 5-star, but 5-star is mentioned repeatedly throughout the email.  This is an honest review whether they want send me the charger or not.

Pros

-Sound is detailed for headphones in this price range.  I own MANY headphones mostly wired and far more expensive.
-Wireless has not given me problems
-Gets plenty loud

Cons

-THIS IS SUBJECTIVE but after an hour my ears hurt no matter which earpiece size I use.

Best Bluetooth Heaphones EVER!,"I usually do not write reviews on amazon,  but for this I felt compared to write one. I started my search for Bluetooth headphones because I brought some ""home Bluetooth headphones"" and I had such a hard time pairing them. Long story, short, I never got to pair them. So, while searching on Amazon,  I came across these headphones and I must say I am impressed. They worth a pretty penny but every cent is worth it. The sound quality is crystal clear.

The fit and sound were better than expected,"I don't typically buy expensive headphones or anything so I'm not comparing the sound quality to that, but I will say that the sound quality of these are much better than other cheap headphones and earbuds I've used in the past. That was a pleasant surprise.

I was also concerned that they would be a bit bulky in my somewhat smallish ears, but the small tip worked and they really weren't that bulky looking.

The next thing I was concerned about was how well they would stay in my ear while running. After some trial running they didn't budge at all and felt quite comfortable in my ear.

The only negative that I have is that after using them the battery life was not as long as I was hoping for. They only lasted about 3 hours before needing to be recharged.

Overall though, better than expected.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Bad fit, bad design, bad battery life","Background: I am by no means an audiophile or someone who has used expensive audio devices or has exceptionally high standards for quality. Despite that, these were bad enough for me to return, and I will explain why. In recent history I really just use whatever Powerbeats-style (connected by a wire, loop/hook that goes over top of ear) knockoff/budget pair I find, and most recently I was using the SENSO Bluetooth headphones. When those broke after much use, I found these and the style was a little different but I decided to give them a go. I will break down my experience in a few categories: fit, sound, bluetooth/design, battery life.

Fit:
-The worst thing I immediately noticed about these was the fit. I took the time rotating through the different size ear piece attachments but none of them fit in such a way that made them feel secure in my ear. I will admit they felt unsecure in my ears much more often than they actually fell out, but despite this the feeling of needing to readjust to be sure was always close by. This is especially frustrating for lifting weights or taking public transportation to work, the two main activities I do while wearing these. I constantly felt the need to twist or push further into my ear but when I did that, the audio would become distorted or I would push the button on the device, pausing the music. When I pushed it again to restart, of course the fit was messed up again.

Sound:
-Not impressive enough to outweigh the bad. The bass was not as hard hitting as my Senso’s. It was hard to tell how good the audio actually was since it would slightly change each time I adjusted them in my ears. Definitely not terrible, just not good enough for the increased price and other inconveniences.

Bluetooth/Design:
-I don’t know how AirPods or other non-wired devices work, but the left and right devices each connected separately to my phone (iPhone XS) and then connected to each other in a second step which you can hear narrated by the device. The issue is, I have to power on both devices and then put both in my ear quickly or it’s possible I won’t know if one connected, so then I have to actually go to my phone’s Bluetooth page to confirm. Additionally, there would be random times where one wouldn’t connect and I would have to power both off and then back on to get it to work. There was also at least one time where it just wouldn’t connect, despite restarting my phone and the devices and trying to let them charge for a little while. When that happened, it was the last straw and I decided to return. And finally the button on the side just doesn’t work well. Bottom line: managing the on/off and connection status of both separately was a pain. Also, the Powerbeats style is in and around the ear, so when I push a button on one of the sides, it doesn’t easily get pushed further into my ear. Not the case with these. If I push it, it sends it into my ear affecting how can hear the music, so I have to pull it out slightly, which then dislodges it, meaning I basically have to be prepared to readjust it every time I want to use the button. There’s also no volume control that I could tell, meaning I have to do that on my phone’s volume rockers. (Something I didn’t have to do with my previous pair)

Battery life:
-Just not good enough, plain and simple. I could make it through two days with my Senso’s, but not these. The charging case didn’t need to be charged nearly as often, so that was nice, and popping them in for a charge is satisfying since there’s a small magnetic pull that snaps them into place. All that is to say, these are the earbuds for you if you love charging super often. However, I shouldn’t have to explain how inconvenient weak battery life is for an audio device when I’m on the go for 12 hours on any given week day. I can get through the day on a full charge, but if it’s not full to start or I forget to charge the night before, it will almost certainly need a charge at an inconvenient time.

Conclusion:
-I stop short of giving this one star since I recognize my biggest gripe, the fit, is a little more subjective and it’s possible they fit most people’s ears better than mine. Subtract the bad fit, assume the connection issues were with my phone and not this device, don’t use them from your morning commute to your evening lift, and maybe you’ll like these. With that said, I’ve already purchased a new Powerbeats style knockoff from Anker and they are immensely better on sound/bass, battery life, and of course the fit. It’s possible that Powerbeats style is just the style for me, or maybe it’s just the right choice for an active lifestyle. But then again, isn’t that the point of going wireless, so you can do more? Take that for what it’s worth.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product needs a little work on stabilizing the connection between earbuds,The sound quality is phenomenal the highs and lows are very crisp. I would love to give this product 5 stars but the 1 complaint i have is that when i sit still both earbuds stay connected but when i walk about the left one seems to cut in and out but then the connection gets stable again. Other than that the product is great. Hopefully the company will address this issue if they haven't begun to already.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound!,I like the small earbuds. They fit my ears very well. I use these to mow my lawn and I am amazed at how low I can play my music and still hear well.

They are super easy to pair,"I am enjoying these earbuds quite a bit.  They are easy to pair, sound is good and I love that I can charge the charging case by placing it on my charging pad.  About the only thing that I think could use any improvement is how long the battery life is for the buds.  They last about 4 1/2 to 5 hours of use.  What I do is use only one at a time.  I listen to iHeart Radio all day while I'm at work so I switch out the buds half way through my day.  It is working out just fine.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best headphones I’ve ever had!,The reviews are all true. These headphones are amazing and for such a good price. The small bud covers fit perfectly in my ear. The first page of the guide book is easy to understand and easy to get started using the headphones. I got the white and they look beautiful. The charging box is so nice and I think guarantees I won’t lose one or both of the headphones!! The sound is also impressively clear and I seriously can’t hear anything else. Can’t wait to use these at the gym! Highly recommend.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great item for great price! (Edited review),"EDIT: It’s been a week and I’m already losing confidence in my purchase. The left earbud is constantly cutting out when my phone is literally inches away. The headphones also keep turning on when they’re in the case (which they are not supposed to do) and pairing to my phone, draining both batteries. They’re still good earbuds. Just not the best quality.

These are great for my first pair of wireless earbuds! Very great at cancelling out the sounds around me. Also I love that I can be listening to music and the people around me can’t hear it. That’s a quality I really desire in earbuds. The headphones pair together easily and make phone pairing very easy. I’m very satisfied with my purchase!",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
using them for work out - they rock,The last pair I bought - NOT THESE - broke right away because of my sweat!  These have not and they work great! They easily pair and I am surprisingly pleased!!!!!!!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect for my purpose!,"These earbuds are perfect for my purpose.  They charge quickly in their great little case on my wireless qi charger, stay in my ear, and turn my media on and off with a touch of a button.  In fairness, I must explain that I only wear the right earbud and use them only to listen to audiobooks.  I know they have capabilities far beyond my limited needs, but I can't tell you about how fabulous they are for listening to music or talking on the phone--not my gig.  But, I absolutely love that I can pause my books easily and listen while driving, gardening, walking, etc without wires or worrying about rain  and no one has to know that I'm ignoring them.  I wish when the power in the right earbud got low, that I could switch to the left earbud, but that doesn't seem to be an option.  Still great!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are very good earbuds for the money,Good sound quality and battery life. The biggest knock is that connecting both earbuds is dependent on the right earbud being connected first. If that's not done they tend to not connect properly. Other than that I am very satisfied.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very uncomfortable,"I really wanted to like these earbuds but after wearing several times I can't stand them.  They are so big (doesn't matter what size cover--the actual earbuds are huge and even when I get them in  it's painful and today one of them fell out when I wasn't even moving.  The sound quality is good but if I can't wear them, not much use.  I sure wish I'd save all the packaging as I'd definitely return them.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Earbuds are Incredible Regardless of Price!,"So I had a pair of Bose Wireless Sport Earbuds that I dearly loved and cost me about $200.00.  Unfortunately (and this is I swear, a true story), my dog ate one of them... I nearly cried.  Now understand that I work out at a minimum of 3 times a week - usually 4, and I sweat like the Beast.  I cannot wear (nor stand) the Apple earbuds and was desperate to get another pair ASAP.  Yeah, well I was having a hard time swallowing (pardon the pun) another $200 expenditure on a replacement set of Bose buds... Enter the TOZO. I saw that these got a high rating here on Amazon and figured at a 1/4 of the price of the Bose, I'd give them a try.  Man!  Am I glad I did.
  Any of the other good reviews on here pretty much sum up how I feel about them.  They're about 1/2 the size of my Bose (see image), stay in place while running and doing cardio, pairing is a breeze and reliable,  and the battery time is excellent. The bass is solid and the highs are clear.
  One other thing these have over the Bose is the ability to drop them onto my wireless charger... Works great and is very rapid! Also, wanted to mention that the microphone is every bit as good as the one from Bose and I've asked friends how I sounded and they all said ""great"".  As for being waterproof... Well, I can't say I've jumped into the shower with them or anything even though the manual practically encourages you to do so, but I can say, that they hold up to some massive sweating with no issue!
  All in all, a great buy and I'd say they hold up to any of the competition regardless of the price!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I would have pay more.,"This is an amazing product, I recently purchased another brand for the gym and this to use at home, I haven't used the gym headphones more than 2 times, not because it is bad, is just because the TOZO t10 is so much better.
The quality and feel is amazing, the little charging box is super useful with its translucent cover you can see the battery level with a glance.
if you are not sure if this is the right product for you, just go for it. you won't regret it",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Average wireless ear pods,"When i read the reviews for this item i thought i stumbled across a gem in the rough. After wearing them around a bit at home and work id say theyre OK. I work in loud warehouse, a job that requires a lot of moving so anything wired has a chance of being caught and ripped out of my ear. After an evening with these guys, theyre not really what i thought theyd be like. The bass is subpar (i get bettwe base from the skul brand you find at walgreens), in order to block out most of the warehouse sound i have to turn my volume up passed the halfway mark by then the sounds arent even and very sharp (even a bass dominated song isnt really bassy more on the sharp side that gives you a headache). Im not a fan with how much they stick out of your ears, i get that currently on the market a lot of wireless earbuds will stick out but this pair REALLY sticks out. I tried increasing the size of earplug and that kind of helped but not by much. They will also connect and disconnect at random moments, even if my phone is a foot from the pods. For the money i spent, im not too satisfied.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best wireless earbuds!,"Amazing product. The built quality is fantastic , truly water proof tested it my self, they feel great they look great, battery is long lasting and the sound is outstanding! Very full clear sound with a great bass to it. Not too much not too little. 5 stars hands down. Pairing is super simple as well. Very pleased",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, good fit, and great customer service.","These are definitely the most quality completely wireless earbuds I've bought in this price range. Considering that they're advertised as ""Deep bass for Sport"" they perform as promised and even a little more. I did have some doubts because they were advertised that way, but they vanished when I pressed play. I was relieved and truthfully a little surprised. So full points there.

I bought them for the gym. They stay secure whenever I'm doing resistance training and any cardio that isn't running. However, if you do run and begin to sweat, that combined with the impact from running cause them to start dislodging from your ear. I expected as much so it wasn't a deal breaker for me but if that's a problem for you, now you know.

They come with a 1 year warranty which I registered on their website for. They have a contact for customer service and they were prompt to answer what couple questions I had.

I can't stand the wire hitting my neck when doing high impact training so these met my needs at an affordable price and I regret nothing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Good for Travel,"I purchased 2 of these units for my wife and myself, primarily for use on long distance air travel.  Sound quality is very close to my older headphones, which were very large and bulky compared to these earbuds.  I like that the earbuds can be recharged several times using the battery contained inside the docking case.  The charge on the earbuds alone was more than enough for our use, but having the extra capacity is appreciated.  Can't speak about the long term durability since I've only had them for about 1 month, but I am currently very satisfied.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price!,These headphones have made my life easier! The sound is great. The headphones do a decent job of drowning everything out.

Enjoying the sound,"Amazing product for the price. Only two downfalls would be need to have extra small ears piece to fit small ears canal. My one ear canal is smaller than the other due to me damaging it when I was a small kid jamming stuff in my ear. Fits perfectly in my other ear, but is loosely fit in small ear canal. Other might be people complaining that they can't hear me. Amazing bass quality and treble.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are a good pair of earbuds.,"Received a bad pair.

Edit: TOZO has contacted me in regards to the earbuds I received. They offered to send me a replacement which is good on their part. Once I receive them I will update my review accordingly. I commend TOZO for standing by their product and sending a new pair out in case the ones that I had received were defective in any way. 4 star review Pending.

Edit: the new ones I received were better than the ones that I was originally sent. I would recommend them. I switch between these for working out and my AirPods for normal listening. They are a good pair of earbuds for the price, sound quality is good for the price and the waterproofing is a plus for working out. I would give them a try for people looking for a set of working out earbuds or a cheaper alternative to AirPods.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Poor bluetooth connection,"The earbuds sound great. They pair with my phone fairly well - but not as seamless as I’d prefer. Haven’t taken a phone call with them so can’t speak to that. Sound great overall. My main concern and the reason for my 3 star rating is due to the bluetooth  connectivity. I bought these to use for working out. If I’m just lifting weights or running on a treadmill and my phone is sitting away from my body - the earbuds work great. However, when I took them jogging and had my phone in a pocket the bluetooth connection would continuously cut out. If I turned to look over my right should the connection would cut entirely and would not return until I returned to looking straight. This is terrible and makes them worthless as a jogging earbud.  Never had this problem with my MPOW D7 headphones. Likely returning these.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best earbuds to have!,"The best wireless earbuds ever. First I would like to say I am so glad they come with different size ear pieces. This really helps find the right fit for you. Second the case, the earbuds are placed in magnetically so they won’t fall out and can be charged via cable or wireless charging pad. I have mine plugged into my car cause it’s more convenient for me. Now for battery life. It’s pretty great! I use my earbuds for taking calls, listening to videos on Facebook, watching memes and movies so I can get a good couple hours of listening if I did it continuously nonstop. The battery doesn’t get used up when on standby so I’ll be at 25% battery before it’s time to charge again at the end of the day. The sound is crystal clear and when you have it in your ear it cancels out any noise to distract from your listening. I like that I have the option to use either one earbud or two so I will have my right earbud in all day and if I need to I can connect my left one in a snap. When it comes to connecting via Bluetooth it connects fast once connected it will beep like 5 times to finish connecting that’s only cause it’s waiting if you are trying to use the other ear bud as well or just the one but the beep will stop :)",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Music Control kills these,"Came from AirPods gen 1, loved them hands down best headphones for me besides max volume. Got power beats pro and they were aweful constantly disconnect if Siri was activated and the range was abysmal. Got AirPods gen 2 and same issue as the beats since it’s the same chip. Unfortunately Apple ruined AirPods till they fix the Siri and connectivity issue. So the hunt for new headphones led me here, another strike out see below.

Pros
Good sound
Quality feels good
Ok distance

Cons
not the most secure fit
No controls for music only calls (biggest issue)
Left ear does sporadically cut in out (nothing crippling but it’s slight annoyance)
Pairing isn’t as seamless",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Impressive true wireless earbuds for a really great price!,"Impressive for what you are paying for. Good sound. Connected very easily tho did not expect I was able to use either the left or right earbud separately. Which is a huge plus because I sometimes prefer the left over the right.

I like the smooths and finished black touch on it. It doesn't feel weird in your ears at all. In fact, I finds these earbuds very comfortable while wearing them.

Excellent Quality Earbuds for the Price!,"I bought my first pair a couple of months ago to use while working out.  Once I managed to swap out the ear pieces with the smallest size (this is the ONLY annoying thing about these earbuds.  The ear pieces don't go on very easily) they stay in my ears during workouts where yes, even my ears sweat.  They are comfortable, the sound is great, and they block out all of the gym noises; even the really loud grunters!  I just bought a second pair for my 22 yr old son who is very particular about technology and he loves them.  The charging case is an awesome feature as well.  Highly recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Left ear problems  cant use just one?,"UPDATE 3 like others have said left ear cuts out frequently
  UPDATE 2. So i still haven't figured out completely, because sometimes it does not beep at all when you try and use one, but i found that the beeping does stop after a minute or so.  UPDATE. so i haven't figured it out yet, but sometimes it does allow me to use just one without the constant beeping , so im not sure what im doing but there seems to be a way of using just one.  wish instructions were clear on this matter. ORIGINAL POST so the description does not say, but reviews said that you can use just one, and i would think this would be a pretty basic expectation, but if you just put one in, it continuously beeps trying to connect to the other, or am i just doing something wrong.  let me know and ill change the review",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Got my brand new TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds!! Excited to discover its mystery.,"My old wireless earphones broke, which leads me to look for a new pair of wireless earphones.
While I was researching and comparing different brand and products, I end up ordering TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds. Frankly, looking at so many positive review on amazon was the first triggering point, however, after much further reason and going through the list of amazing features offered by this wireless earbud, I'm sold!

So, finally I got my pair of TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds, yesterday and I really like the compact packaging of this product. The build quality sounds really solid and trendy.

1. Package comes with a pair of IPX8 waterproof TWS stereo Headphones (IPX8!!!!)
Earbuds are comfortable and high quality as advertived by the company.

2. Value for money, with good build quality and compare to other brands affordable price.

3. Battery life, I still need to completely check it but till so far earbuds are holding its juice from past 2+ hrs.

4. Wireless charging case as an added bonus, which can easily extend earbuds life 3 times (8-9 hours). Moreover, its trendy, good build quality and makes easy to carry TOZO T10 earbuds when not in use.

I'll try to update my post after a month.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
AWESOME product especially for the price,I ordered these extremely hesitant as I have a problem with ear buds causing pain in my ears. Unfortunately due to my work having huge headphones on just creates to many issues so i ordered these anyway. BEST purchase I could have made as these headphones are extremely comfortable and sound amazing. Even better i didnt realize when i bought them that they were waterproof but a couple friends of mine also bought them after i let them try em and my 1 friend brought it to my attention that they are waterproof so he uses them in the shower(of course i had to try it) and they worked awesome even in the shower. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. For those who might want to know they case will recharge them they last approx. 3.5 hours per charge. and the case recharges them a few times.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Best Sounding and Convenient Earbuds,"The earbuds have a nice design along with its perks for being resistant(if not proofed) against water damage. The little battery container is a nice small design to carry in your pocket, and if you wished to hang it on a string for a more convenient carry, it provides a little loop on the side to feed string through.

The earbuds themselves have a small design. Which can make me a little more conscience about losing them. But they fit in the ear very well and they provide for more silicon sizes in case the already rubbery interior of the earbud didn't quite fit. They stay in my ear surprisingly well for every day to day activities, however, when it comes to working up a hard sweat either working in the summer heat or just working out in general, I find that the earbuds start giving way to fall out. Now I do recognize that Tozo has other earbud products with an ear wrap around to keep earbuds in securely, but this product was advertised for ""Sports"" in the title. I would say these earbuds may not be the right fit for sports, but as I said before, Tozo does offer other earbuds better fit for Sports activities.

The pairing is very simple and quick and I have had no trouble with it. As soon as the earbuds are taken out of its battery container, they immediately begin pairing the earbuds together and ready to be pair with whatever device you are ready to connect them to.

Overall, I am quite satisfied with these for regular use for Almost any activity.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

I experienced a problem where I had to re-pair my buds after a phone call, but that may have been because I had my old broken LG headset still on and paired—not complaining, about this product anyways.  For $50 they’re a great value and I’m sure they last longer than my old over-priced LG headsets that always had a problem with one channel dying because of a short in the electrical wire developed after some time of retracting and pulling the earbuds from the headset.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

"Great sound, wish the button was a touch, didn’t fit me","I have small ears so it is hard for me to find earbuds that stay in. I tried another pair first, and they didn’t fit well, and the sound was quiet. Then I tried these. They stay in my ears 95% of the time, however they stick out very far and don’t fit in the outside of my ear like they are supposed to do they are easy to knock out. They also come out easily when I sweat a lot. The sound is great, but the fit doesn’t work for me. I would have returned but I missed the return window.

I wish these had touch control, because you can’t tap to pause. The button is difficult to press so you have to hold the earbud while you push the button. It’s a little annoying.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, Great customer support!  Be careful around water though....","These earbuds are advertised as being waterproof.  Sadly, this I did not find this to be true.  I had used them for 2 months, liked the sound quality and they were comfortable but was disappointed when the first time it got wet one of the ear buds stopped working.

Edit.  I contacted Tozo and explained what happened and they offered to replace he headphones for free, no questions asked.  I appreciate a company that will stand behind their warranty.  I was always happy with the sound, fit and functionality of the earbuds but initially gave it a poor rating because they weren't ""waterproof"" as advertised.

Amazing Earbuds!,"These earbuds are amazing, I'm wowed by the sound quality.
I've heard sounds from songs I've listened to with other headphones that I did not hear before but now with these headphones, I can hear everything clear as day.
The bass is full and vibrant, sounds like angels in my ears.
The noise cancelling is A++, I put them in and tune the world out and for $50?
You cannot beat that price point as compared to Apple Airpods which cost double that price.
As well as it being waterproof!
I've showered with these and they got wet yet still worked the same like nothing ever happened.
The case has a strong magnetic closure to ensure that it will not open and disrupt your earbuds.

Good sound (including base) / Horrible fit for me (maybe I have weird ear canals),"I bought these to use while I'm running.  The actual ear pieces pair wonderfully to each other and to my phone and I was really excited.  The sound quality for music is excellent and phone calls (mic) is relatively decent.  The biggest problem I had with these is that they constantly fell out of my ears.  To be clear,  if I was moving at all (running/walking/ect) they had no chance of staying in place.  i had to search on the ground too many times for them to even be worth anything to me.  And I did try the different ear piece fittings under ""active conditions"" and it made no difference for me

I actually got so fed up I was going to throw them away  and chalk it up to a failed experiment but daughter hijacked them with the last new ""earpiece"" fittings and she likes them well enough.

TLDL:  They were rubbish for me but as a 40 something male maybe i have a strange ear canals that makes these unusable.  ymmv",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Im impressed!,"These earbuds are really nice. They fit very well in my ear and have great call and sound quality. I showed them to a buddy of mine skis a real stickler for sound quality in music. He told me that the earbuds were not going to sound great because of the transmission over bluetooth and yadda yadda yadda..... I told him to put them in and listen. Well, he was impressed! These earbuds actually have base too! Im very happy with my purchase!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Excellent sound quality, workmanship and support",These are quality headphones.  They fit snugly in my ears and they stayed in. The key is to find the right size earcaps (they provide 4 sizes).  The sound quality is very good. I use Spotify which provides a way to set the equalizer to your preferences.  I am sure apple music and other apps provide similar capabilities.  The noise reduction is reasonably good and actually lowered outside noise as I walked through my neighborhood. Support is excellent!  I wanted to reset the earpods and wasn’t sure how to do this. I sent an email to their website.  I received a personalized response and was very satisfied with their support.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome product,"I must say that I was a little hesitant when I first baught these ear buds as I had never heard of the brand before. However, these ear buds far exceeded my expectations. The sound is clear and the bass is awesome. When I wear them I hear no outside noise! They are water proof. The awesome part, is when I am done, I put them back in the portable case and they recharge automatically. When I take them out, they connect right away with no issue. I am happy with my purchase as well as the price I paid. Great product. If you are looking for a great set of ear buds at a reasonable price, get these. You wont be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for single side use,"Working in an office environment, I really like the ability to have one kept on the charger and use the other one until I need to swap as they both pair individually. The sound is good and the variety of tips to fit your ear is nice. It's great to be able to simply remove them from the charging case and have them automatically connect to my phone after the initial pairing.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product with 5 star sound quality and battery life.,"Great earbuds. Just arrived yesterday and I had been using them since. Sound quality is awesome given the price paid for it. Using them was easy. Just turn both earbuds on and they’ll automatically pair with each other. Next find them on your device and connect. Done! Battery life is great. I had to switch to bigger size earplugs but once I did that, they stay in no matter how much I jump or run. Would definitely recommend them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great ear buds at a great price,"I bought these for my son for Christmas and I like them so much, I’ll get a pair for myself. They paired with no problem and the sound quality is very good. There are 4 LEDs on the case to indicate charge level of the battery pack. The instructions claim you can charge the ear buds 4x using the battery pack before having to charge it again but we typically don’t run them dead before charging.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, difficult fit","I really like these and would like to like them more.  The sound is good and even for me with rather sensitive ears that don't like most in-ear buds these are comfortable.  The fall out pretty easily, though so, for me personally, I can't imagine using them during activity.  Good for working at my desk or under a motorcycle helmet.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good product but no so good customer service,"The earbuds are good for the price I paid.  Very good battery life.  I haven't used any other Bluetooth waterproof / sweat proof earbuds , this one seems pretty good but all the fancy features start to fall apart after a few weeks of use. 1. It is not suitable for answering phone calls as the other side cannot hear me even if I raised my voice.  2. I also enjoyed the wireless charging as the charging port at the back of the case if very narrow and unless you use the charging cord that comes with the earbuds, other charging cords (same type) will not fit.  3. Not so good customer service.  Two months later, the wireless charging no longer worked.  I tried to contact customer service by email, and have not heard back from them at all.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great headphones to use while active!,My fiance got me these so I could listen to music while I do yard work...I've had bluetooth headphones in the past but the wire connecting them would always get caught on my hat or neck as I was working outside. Love that these are totally separate earbuds. The sound quality is great and the charging case is really convenient. They came with a lot of different plastic earbud options so I'm still trying a couple of those but overall they're working out well!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
So easy to connect and use.,"I found this product so easy to connect and use.  I had a set of wireless buds before, but they could not take the sweat of running. These Tozo T10 ear buds can. When running they do not work loose at all. I find them very easy to control and work well for phone conversations.  I also really like how the case keeps the buds charged. I would like to have them have a little more bass, though.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great Earbuds, price and quality","Very impressed; originally purchased a pair for my wife as her inexpensive BT ear buds failed. I did not want to spend the money on Apple's options, and Skullcandy options were out of my price range as well. She was so impressed with her new ear buds that I bought a pair. I'm blown away,  as they are more comfortable than my XTFree Skullcandy headset and sound just as good. Bass response is great, maybe a touch too ""bassy"". Phone calls with earbuds work well. Overall very happy, I rarely leave reviews. Great option if you are looking for inexpensive earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They are great... when the sound is working properly,"I was really excited about these earbuds. They came quickly, the charging case is awesome. The different sized earbud pieces ensure a good fit.  My problem is that I'll be listening and everything is fine. Then all of a sudden I hear a lot of static and the music goes in and out of the left and right channel or the music skips. It's maddening. When they ate working correctly they are great and a good price point.
But because of the sound issue I am thinking of returning them.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Never thought they would sound this great...,"Just got these and I am amazed how good they sound.....bass is fantastic and clear, they get pretty loud but I'm one of those people that like to crank it all the way up which is why my wife says I'm going deaf...but for the normal person they are loud enough.
Call quality seems good but haven't been able to test it while at work yet (Truck driver) so I'll will update soon....  just based on listening to music I would recommend them 100% other than that only time will tell on the durability...",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Microphone Issue,"I just bought the new TOZO T10 earbuds. The sound quality is great. I love it.
However, when I tried to make a phone call, the person on the other end couldn't hear what I said. The sound always got interrupt. Sometimes they heard it loud and clear, and sometime barely heard a word. If i hold the right one close to my mouth when talking, the person can hear well. On the other hand, the left one didn't do the same.

I don't know if they will let me return the earbuds or exchange for a different pair.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Randomly turn on when not using them & don’t fit to well,My headphones randomly turn themselves on while in the charging case so pretty much need to charge them every night where I plan to use them the next day. The sound quality is great but they don’t stay in the ear very well when moving around like bicycling or exercising at the gym and tend to fall out often.,1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great product for a GREAT price!!,"I have been super impressed with these little guys. First, I use these all day with one headphone in while at work. I have the volume at the lowest setting (on my phone) and one headphone literally lasts 5 hours of constant use. No exaggeration. Again, this is at the lowest volume setting, so I am sure that plays a big part. I listened to one headphone for 5 hours straight, then would throw it in the charging case and listen to the other headphone for the rest of the day. While doing this for a whole week, the charging case never ran out of juice. So basically for me, I charge the case & headphones on Sunday, then listen to them (one headphone at a time) Monday through Friday and put them in the case over night. And the case lasts all week without a charge.

Even at the lowest setting, these sound amazing. I have had them up to mid to 3/4 volume, and they BUMP! Great bass while maintaining great sound quality. If you put them in correctly, they block out all exterior sounds.
I have not fully tested the call experience yet, but the one call I had I was able to hear the other person perfectly, and after a second or two the other person was able to hear me ok as well.
I have been recommending these to everyone who will listen. My wife wasn’t even thinking about new headphones until she tried these, now she wants a pair!
Can not recommend these enough!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Stopped Charging - **Updated**,"The sound was great, and battery life was *ok*, but after a couple months of use the right ear piece stopped charging.

**Update** Company sent me a free replacement. Very fast shipping, great customer support. I'm assuming the last pair was just defective.

Sound quality is great. They have good volume and deep base. Louder than my Anker Sound Beats, and fuller base.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great true wireless capability!,"Great for use at work especially because I can keep a bud in one ear and still use my headset for my phone. I've used the bluetooth headphones that are connected together with cords and since I usually only have one bud in, the cord and other bud would always get in the way or catch on stuff. The full wireless capability is the way to go! These buds work great for most casual use, but I have yet to try them while doing more strenuous activities.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pairing and Syncing with Phone is an ease!,"I just recently bought a Note 10+ and new that I needed a good pair of wireless headphones. I have a pair of Beats but they get bulky and cumbersome and wanted a good, quality wireless earbuds. These do no disappoint, they come with multiple rubber tips for all ear sizes. As soon as you take out of the case and place in ears they pair effortlessly and connect to the phone within seconds. The initial setup was a breeze, battery life has been surprising good, been using them off and on since Sunday (8/25) and still haven't had a need to recharge as of Friday (8/30). The charging indicator in the case is simple and easy to read, earbud construction is very solid. Anyone who buys this product will not be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great pair of headphones for the price with great audio quality,"Great pair of headphones for modern (non headphone jack having) smartphones below are my list of pros and cons.

Pros:
Great audio quality
Easy to pair
Nice charging case
Decent battery life

Cons:
They may fall out if you ears generate more ""grease"" than average
When using just one it tries to pair to the other for nearly 2-3 mins and makes a beeping noise which it turns the music down for.
It appears they have their own built in EQ (which is a bit too bassy for me) and default volume, so if you change the EQ on your phone you may have to connect the headphones go into your EQ settings on your phone change the EQ then change it back (if you have it set for a perfered EQ setting.

Summary:
Great pair of headphones for the price with great audio quality (once the Eq is right for your needs) but With some minor inconveniences",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Ok product, Decent battery, Decent Noice cancellation for the price","I was having intermittent connection drops when connected to my MacBook.
Switching between devices is not a pleasant experience and definitely not seamless.
While they are not too heavy, they don't feel light on your ear as well and long term wearing might cause some inconvenience.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for all outdoor activities,"I workout every day and other earbuds would not work during sweating conditions - these Tozo's work perfectly.  Also, I swim regularly and while they do not work under water, the sound returns immediately once your head has cleared the water line. Absolutely the best ear buds that I haver ever used.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Depends on what you use them for,"I use these mainly when I’m sitting at me desk at work and listen to podcasts and for that they are great. I get about 6 hours of continuous play at low volume before they shut down. After about 15 minutes in the case they charge back up to about 80%.

Absolutely horrible for working out or any type of physical activity. THEY WILL FALL OUT. NONSTOP.

If you plan on using these for commuting, around the house or at work then I really do recommend them they cancel outside noise really well and have good bass. For weight lifting or running these get 0 stars.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good customer service, product needs improvement to make it last more than 6 months.","Update, 17/7/19
After one day, a very polite CSR, Shirley, from Tozo responded with an offer to send me a brand new headset.

I therefore have changed my rating to a five stars for customer service.

The headset was working great until yesterday when all of a sudden they stopped recharging.  I tried many things but to no avail.

There is no customer service / tech support number, just an email address and their website is void of any troubleshooting data.  I sent an email and am now at their mercy for a reply and maybe a satisfactory resolution.

This is a further example of low quality junk products sold by Amazon.

I’m going back to Bose, best products and great customer service!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great price-quality balance,"I commute every day on my bike and these earbuds are perfect for what I need. While I—of course—did not expect sound quality like Bose offers, I was positively surprised; perhaps a bit heavy on the base but overall much better than I would have expected. A great feature is that I can only use one earbud (right) while leaving the other in the charging case. You need to get both out of the case at the same time, have it paired, and then return the left earbud. It will beep a couple of times but after that, it works like a charm. Would I buy again? Yes; in fact, I did. I was unlucky to lose one—my own fault—so I purchased them again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good but bud broke,"It’s amazing! I’ve had it for 2 months by now and every things good. But I was listening to them in the shower (as they say their waterproof) and my left bud disconnected. This had happened to me before so I think I just missed a battery low warning. I got out the shower and plugged them in they didn’t even register. But just to make sure I put the righ bud in and it works I tried holding them for a few seconds.Nothing. Other than this unfortunate incident I do suggest them because they do still have amazing sound quality, they are water proof and have a good battery life.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good battery life, easy to pair",Used these for the first time on a quick weekend trip. Paired easily with my iPhone. I used them for a 2 hour flight each way and still had battery life despite not charging in between. Noise cancellation worked well as I didn’t hear surrounding noise over my phone audio while on the plane. Overall very happy with the quality!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comparable to earbuds double the price,I was really impressed with these earbuds. They support connecting to two devices at once which I think is a petty unique feature for true wireless earbuds. They fit well and sound great with good bass. They connect easily without any issues. Unfortunately my dog chewed one of the earbuds. It still works but I doubt that it is water proof anymore. I tried several others and had to spend more than double to get ones better.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Perfect size, great looking, and awesome sound!","Had these for a few days now and I love them. I brought them to work and hung out in the noisy break room, and I wasn’t able to hear a word outside of my music. The fit is great, and I was able to find the perfect size because they supplied 4 different bud sizes. Weight is minimal and you barely remember they’re in. Easy to understand pairing instructions. The case is great and holds 4 charges; plus the fit of the ear buds into the case is perfect with a magnetized attachment. All that for a super cheap price makes me a happy camper. Exactly what I’d hoped for when I purchased these!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wayy better alternative than the apple airpods,"I love this cheaper alternative to the apple airpods. the sound quality is sooo much better and the noise cancellation is impeccable. a lot of times people around me would be talking to me and i couldn't hear a thing! I loved this product so much that i got my sister her own pair.

the only thing i hope they might be able to change in their next model is to be able to turn the charging case on and off so the earbuds are not being charged everytime i put it back in the case. because sometimes i only use the earbuds for 10 minutes or shorter.  another thing i hope they might be able to modify is to be able to use the earplugs individually. a lot of times i want to go out with one of the earplugs so i can at least hear people around me (because the noise cancellation is soo good with both on) but I am not able to use one of them alone because of the beeping that happens if you put one if them back in the case. the only way i can use one of them is when i put the other earbud in my pocket but i am always afraid of losing that earbud.

But overall I am VERY satisfied with this product and I will continue to recommend it to people around me. apple airpods are so overrated haha",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Earbuds and an Amazing Price,"These have been the perfect wireless earbuds for me. The sound quality is shockingly good, especially considering the price. The volume capability is also impressive.

I've had no static or any problems at all.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
OMG!,"I never thought this headphones will be that good! I previously bought another brand here in Amazon for the same prize range,but that was trash compared to this one.

Came as Advertised,"I had a different pair of Bluetooth headphones I loved that I accidentally ran over with my car (sad, sad day). So I was unexpectedly in the market for new ones as the company I had purchased from didn't make the headphones I ruined any longer. After significant research and reading reviews I decided to go with the TOZO T10 5.0 Wireless Earbuds based on over 5,000 reviews that were mostly positive. Turns out I made the right decision, and here's why: 1. These cancel out ambient noise better than any pair of non-custom headphones I've ever owned (I do own a pair of Alcair in-ear monitors custom fit and they are the only things that seal better than the TOZO). This means when I am mowing the yard, edging, or on a run near a busy street I can hear the podcast to which I am listening without an issue. 2. The low end in these headphones is substantial giving power and depth to music you stream. 3. They fit very nicely in my ears and, no matter how much I sweat on a run or doing yardwork, they remain in my ears once I have put them in place (the instructions on this are very helpful and really do lock these universal earbuds into your ears as if they were made for you - though to be fair I have larger ears so headphones do fit a bit easier). 4. The charging case and battery life are nice. I went two weeks after the initial charge upon receiving them in the mail before I had to charge them again.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Holy battery batman!,"I have had these for maybe a week, and am THOROUGHLY impressed, I have showered with these, dropped them onto concrete and accidentally stepped on them, this is legitimately the most impressive pair of earbuds ive had, and the best part? THE BATTERY LIFE,  like holy damn im an irresponsable person so I forget to charge things, and with daily use of about 1-2 hours per day THEY STILL HAVENT DIED 14 HOURS OF SERVICE WITH 1 CHARGE. I was working in a study room and someone called my name, I didnt hear them, they started YELLING at me and I didnt hear them these earbuds are AMAZING. If I had to make one complaint it would have to be the wind, when cycling you can hear the wind on your ears which is kinda meh, but you cant do anything about it, thats just physics. So its a 5 stars from me",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good bargain,"These are perfect for the office. We are not allowed to wear ear covering, noise canceling headphones so I thought these would be a good alternative. They are perfect!

Headphones beat $200 Bose earsports,I was settling for a new cheap earphones that would get me through the gym. What I got in this product blew me away.

Impressive sound quality,"I had always used a ""wrap around head"" headphone to workout.  My recent one broke after a few months so I bought this one to try out the ""earbuds"".  The sound quality is definitely a notch above the cheap fitness headphones.  It was easy to pair & the extra earbuds sizes helped with choosing the best buds for my ears.  Even though the descriptions said it would be fine to take that along with you to the shower, I opted out of that.  It was fine though throughout my workout, waterproof against sweat.  A good bang for your buck.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Fake reviews - not a good product,"Bought these earbuds 2 weeks ago as my first experience with Bluetooth earbuds.
Design is nice and it comes with a bunch of different tips so they can really fit into your ear, a plus for that.
BUT, once I started listening to videos on my tablet, I noticed that the sound had a micro-second difference with the actual video. Thought it wasn't that bad.
BUT, I tried with my app Duolingo and  not only it lagged but everytime they were saying something, I would miss the first or second word because of the bad connection.
With just that, I was happy I didn't spend more money into that kinda product.
BUT after just 2 weeks, the earbuds wouldn't connect anymore with my phone. Don't know why, but it would take 5 attempt to finally connect.

On top of all that, reviews on this product are potentially fake. Once you register your product online for the warranty, you get an email asking you to rate 5 stars and in exchange, they send you a wireless charger.  So beware that from that 10 000 plus reviews, a lot of them were bought from the company itself.
I returned them and bought another brand for cheaper....better sound, better connection.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

ITS A MIRACLE!!,"I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!
The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.

Great Product Excellent Customer Service,"This product is great! The sound quality and bass truly astounded me for the price. I originally had a little difficulty getting the right earbud to stay in my ear (a typical problem for me), but with adjusting the earpiece and doing a little twisting, it works great. I encountered a problem within one week of purchasing where the right earbud stopped working, but I emailed the company and they immediately responded and let me know that they would send me a brand new pair (without even having to send the old ones back)! Even if the product didn't sound as fantastic as it does, I'd back it simply because the company so assuredly stands behind their product! They also are excellent with noise cancellation as they ended up stopping working during the middle of my workout, but I kept them in because of how good they canceled out my surroundings and helped me focus on my lift!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Affordable alternative ear buds that are great!,"I have my buds connected to my Samsung Galaxy smart watch. They pair easily. The sounds is fantastic and gets plenty loud.

Highly recommend you give these a try. You won't be disappointed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
poor microphone,"I bought these to replace lost Airpods that are important to me for conference calls. They sound good but I am told the sound on the other end (hearer)  is distant and muffled.

So don't buy if you plan to use for conference calls.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A great pair of wireless pods!,"So my son wanted the new Samsung pods but for what they cost I was afraid he'd lose one.  So I saw these Tozo's and they were reasonably priced and had solid reviews.  After a couple of months they are holding up well. The sound and fit are great. Make sure you use the right cover for your ear! The mic picks up phone conversations pretty easy, though I've only used it indoors to make calls. They were pretty easy to pair to our phones and the charger case is nice, maybe a little bulky but with the extra juice for your phone it's worth the bulge in your pocket. Overall they're a solid pair with great sound and features. Do yourself a favor and get two pair!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
A good bang for your buck.,"Let me just say that I'm very surprised, didn't think that they would be any good. First the sound quality is amazing, deep bass and clear voice. Battery life is pretty awesome. I got a good 4.5 hours on a single charge. And like 3 charges out of the case. The fit is pretty good. I'm a mechanic and work in awkward positions and the buds didn't fall out. But will say that once you sweat they will get loose. They pair really quick to the phone and each other. Overall for the price they are really good. Would recommend these to a friend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Disappointed with these,"Even though this product had good reviews, I'm not happy with them.  When working properly, which is only about 50% of the time, the sound quality is very good.  The problem is that they cut out, switch back and forth between left and right, and go into an echo mode randomly.  They've completely dropped out in the middle of calls several times so I can't count on using them at all for important virtual meetings.  And battery life I haven't found to be anywhere near what is claimed.

My opinion is that you should buy something else.  These aren't worth the money.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great quality earbuds at a great price,"These headphones are extremely good, particularly for their price. They come with a handy charging case, several different ear pad sizes, and a charging cord for the case. The default earpads fit my ears perfectly. I took them for a test drive on my most recent trip to the grocery store. I was able to listen to my audiobook without having to constantly adjust the earbud and it made a banal task into something fun. I'd highly recommend these headphones for anybody who wants decent sound at a great price and wants to be able to charge them wirelessly. Battery on the headphones is excellent lasting me for over 4 hours. The case can charge that your buds up three or four times so these are good for long trips or long shifts at work.

I've primarily been using them paired with my cell phone for listening to music but I also tried them out on a lengthy phone call and was told that my voice sounded crisp and clear (which was an issue I experienced with some wired headphones).

So far so good...but some problems,"I purchased these to replaced my old bluetooth earbuds (which would only hold a charge for 40 min) to use exclusively at the gym.  Upon arrival I was a little skeptical of these earbuds.  The initial pairing with my iPhone 8 was simple enough but when removing them from the case for daily use they weren't automatically pairing with my phone.  I contacted customer support and they gave me instructions to reset the earbuds and that still didn't seem to help.  I came to find out that it just takes about 15-20 seconds to find and connect to my phone.  It's not a huge deal but I expected it to pair more quickly.  Custom support was quick to respond and friendly but you should know what to expect.  Their initial response will most likely be a cut and paste from the instruction manual or promotional bullet points that may or may not answer your specific question.

Another issue I've found is if you remove the left earbud first, it won't pair with the right.  Even if you remove them at the same time, there's a chance the left will start looking for your phone making it unable to pair with the right.  So, lesson learned. Always remove the right earbud first.

Lastly, I've only had these about a week but I have a hard time believing the charging case will give me a full 4 charges.  I fully charged the case and earbuds on Monday, went to the gym, used the earbuds for about an hour (not the full battery life) and placed them in the case to charge.  The case was already down to 3 of 4 lights. Went to the gym on Wednesday, wore them for an hour, placed them back in the case.  Now the case was down to 2 lights.  Same deal on Friday, case was down to 1 light.  So while for my personal use, they will probably give me 4 charges for each hour of use, I'm not sure if I fully depleted the earbud batteries each time, if the case would give me the 4 FULL charges.

Also, I should mention that customer support emailed me separately asking me if I would like a ""truly free"" ""no strings attached"" wireless charger.  I said, of course! To which they replied and asked if I would write a ""kind honest"" review.  They didn't say I HAD to but I felt like it anyway.  So we'll see if my 4 star review will still grant me the free charger.  With all the negatives above I hope this comes off as an honest review.

To end on a positive, the sound quality is good (I listen to rock/metal so I don't need all the bass hip hop and dubstep fans cry about) and the multiple earbuds sizes allowed me to find the perfect fit.  Overall I'm very pleased with them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, poor battery and connectivity. PLEASE READ!","I will start this review with the positives.

-I have been using these ear buds for just over a month now. The sound is actually pretty damn good. I was surprised by this. The low end gives a nice bass sound but not too much that kills the high end. It's a perfect balance! So the sound was definitely good. And after changing the ear bud tips, I was able to find a comfortable one that fits in my ears and will stay most of the time.

But there are many negatives for me..

-Connectivity is a pain. I learned quickly that I needed to remove the right ear bud from the dock first so that it would scan for Bluetooth connection. If you pull the left one first you can't connect to your device. Also I frequently would have issues with them not pairing with my phone. I would have to turn them off and back on to get them to connect. It's annoying......

-The microphone is terrible. When talking on the phone most times people can't hear me unless I talk very loud! Not happy about that.

-And lastly, the battery! The ear buds show on my phone that they have 30% battery life but the buds will still tell me to charge them. And does so every 10 seconds until I turn them off. They are supposed to last 3.5 hours but honestly it's probably just over 2.5 hours. And the charging case doesn't seem to hold much of a charge. After consistent use of only a month it's only good for 1 full charge and partial of another..

Look it's not bad for the price. However I do wish I had just invested the money into a pair of Bose.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Loss of sound in left earbud,"Major issues with these earbuds. Limited distance of about 7'.  The right earbud works fine (thats the one that connect to your phone) The left earbud doesnt stay connected, volume will drop and come back on as if it doesnt have a strong connection (it connects to the right earbud)",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound at an affordable price,I bought these for my husband because he works outside with loud equipment. These headphones have quality sound and work great even with all of the sweating he does! They do not fall out of his ears and he says they are really comfortable.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
New earbuds are cool,I’ve only had them for two days. I do like the sound quality very much. I had to change the size that came in the ear pods but now the fit is much better. I’ll update soon.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Exceeded expectations,I casually mentioned to a friend I was looking for wireless earbuds and he recommended TOZO.  The price was lower than the others I had in mind but took the risk on a “cheap” pair.  These sound amazing!  The bass is warm and the clarity is fantastic.  I am hearing things in my favorite songs that I’ve never noticed before!  Pairing with my phone and my Fitbit was a breeze.  Looking forward to enjoying these for a long time.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Nice earbuds for this price,"I would say, I have tried more than 10 true wireless earbuds but this one is one of best under I would say $99 range. I only paid $45 with the promo code and got IPX 8 waterproof earbuds. The only one thing I am not satisfied is the sound quality. Well maybe to me I don’t like too much bass but they have powerful and strong bass if you like. Other than that I have nothing to complain with these earbuds! $45 for them, what else you wanna expect? Of course sounds quality is not as good as jabra or bose or Sony but they are $200 range. I love mine",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for the price!,"Great sound with base and mid range asside from the occasional fade out between the ear buds. One flaw is that you can only control stop or play. There is no advance or backup/repeate  feature with the earbuds.

I have used many earbuds in the past and these fit comfortably in my ears where others have failed with a tight fit. They are better sounding than the more expensive or fancier brands listed for sale on amazon. Infact these almost have the sound quality of a good pair of over ear headphones.

The earbud battery could use a little longer play time as other similar earbuds can play 4-5 hours without recharging.

One major issue is that the earbuds do not connect automatically to my cellphone. I have to connect them manually. Well worth the price though.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The best noise cancelling earbuds you need to own!,"TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds are the best headphones I have ever owned. The sound quality is by far the best Ive experienced. The sound can be very loud if thats your liking or at a medium level with little outside noise interference. Outside of running and gym workouts, I use these as I cut the grass. I barely hear the lawnmower. I am also an audiobook/podcast fan and am easily distracted. I am submerged into my book or podcast with these earbuds. Exercise is no longer frustrating as these earbuds fit snuggly into my ears without constant adjustment. To me the best part of these is the pairing ease. The first time I took one of the buds out the BlueTooth connection was visible on my phone. No holding any buttons and waiting for different blinking lights! Ive owned these earbuds for a few weeks now and have only charged twice. Ive never had issues with power. I am now a loyal customer to this brand! If you are reading this, click above to buy these right now!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Bluetooth earbuds,"Work exactly as described, long playtime, stays in ears well, comfortable, easy to pair. I love that you can just use the right earbud. I use them most often for walking the dog while wearing my 8month old baby on my back. I need to be able to hear cars coming, etc. these provide great sound while only wearing one earbud.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Sound quality is much better than my old earbuds,"These earbuds have deeper bass and sharper  tones than any of my former bluetooth earbuds.  I actually had to turn down the volume from where it was set on my old set.  The fit is snug without any problems at the gym.  At first it was a little setback when I realized the buttons on the earbuds do not let you skip songs or change the volume , but then I learned I can just ask Google to do that for me since I have a Pixel.  Overall I am very happy with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound and Outstanding Service!,"I ordered the Tozo T10 earbuds a month ago after reading and comparing other earbuds reviews with the same price range. I am very satisfied with the T10. The sound quality is really great and is comparable to many much more expensive earbuds. I used them to work out in the gym and the noise cancellation is terrific. Unfortunately, I dropped one earbud on the gym floor and could not find it. I wrote to Tozo and explained this to them and they promised to send me a new pair! Wow, that's great service!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They sound great but lose connection frequently,"I picked these up to replace my wired earbuds for use when working out, biking, yardwork etc.
The sound quality was great,  actually much better then my previous beats earbuds.  While in use I notice that at first the left channel would randomly drop out and reconnect.  The problem would come and go, sometimes every few minutes which made this highly annoying.
Then I took my first long use trip via a plane flight from NJ to CA,  on a full charge I got just north of 2.5 hours before they alerted me to a recharge.  Recharging took about 30 min, and it was good to go again.  But during this time both left and right channels would drop randomly.  These lasted until the battery died and then I switched to my corded solution and stayed that way for the remaining 3 hours of the flight.

Overall I am on the fence with these..  battery time is OK..  but random channel dropping just got worse as time progressed.  I have these paired with a Galaxy S7,  at first I thought maybe it was the phone,  but I paired it with a bluetooth speaker and no disconnects .  And this is with the speaker being further away from the phone then the earbuds.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good value for the price point,"The sound is really pretty good for the money.  I'm told folks can hear me very clearly when on a phone call - another good point.  I bought them for use on my sailboat - a forever damp environment and they're great for that.  The BT range is good - at least 47'.  They're a bit heavy so not great for running unless you get the fit ""just right.""",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Good for listening to music but horrible for speaking to callers!,"These are of great quality for listening to music. I would recommend this for music listening only. None of my callers are able to hear me when I speak. They ask me to repeat myself every other word. Since I purchased these for wireless talking, I am not happy with my purchase.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome earbuds!,Everything about about these feels like quality. Even the packaging is durable and attractive. The instructions are clear. I thought having to pair two devices would be a hastle but you just follow the instructions and once paired they connect with your phone automatically when you take them out of the charging dock. I was also a bit worried that they wouldn’t stay I my ears while running but they provide 4 steps of different sized earbuds so finding a size that fits and stays put is easy. Love these earbuds and use them every day. Would definitely purchase again!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Where have these been my whole life?,"Finally! I’ve purchased 5 sets of wireless earbuds have always had issues with them coming out of my ears,  or pairing or the battery life only lasting a short time. These are perfect! They came with different size ear cushions and fit like a dream. The sound quality is amazing and they pair themselves. These are my new favorite thing, add the great price and wireless charging and just wow!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Better than Expected,"I am very pleased with my purchase! The earbuds were ready to use right out of the box. The packaging was very professional looking. The instructions were easy to follow. The only thing that I didn't like was the terminology used in the instructions. It referred to the right earbuds as MASTER and the left earbuds as SLAVE. It made me really uncomfortable at first and I considered sending them back. I decided to keep them because I think that it was not meant to be offensive, even though it is. Instead, I will just address it in my review. I gave this review 5 stars because the product is 5 star quality, so far. The customer service has been 5 star quality as well. I recommend these earbuds BUT I also recommend the company considering removing the power designations in the future.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Think you can't wear earbuds?,"I could never find comfortable earbuds so always wore the sports type that is wired and hooks over your ears.  Well recently my iPhone died and I found that the newer iPhones only accept wireless headphones.  After spending several days reading review after review I decided to give this pair a try. I was impressed that it came with different sized earpieces. I thought this would give me a better chance of finding a secure and comfortable set of earbuds. I was right!

From the moment I inserted them they were comfortable!  I listen to Audible books as I go about my day.  No matter what activity I am doing the earbuds stay right where they belong.  I couldn't be happier!  You absolutely should give the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds a try.  You won't be sorry.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not for running,This is good headphones if you're going to be using them in the gym and you're not doing a whole bunch of movement like doing weights; basically anything except running. They also do not really sit well in my ears. I wish there was a smaller model.,3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
If looking for Bluetooth earbuds these are a MUST BUY,Only had these for a few days so far but I really love these buds.  Time will tell how they hold up but they are an all around 5 star unit.  Wish I would’ve bought them sooner.  The bass is incredible for such a small unit that was really surprising to me.  When I was shuffling around music just testing and a post Malone song came on and the bass slammed I was like wow that’s incredible how low the bass drops and still sounds good in them.  I have beats solo wired headphones and these sound comparable. The range is ok probably like 20 feet. The call quality seemed good. My wife said she heard me good when I was talking to her on them.  They fit in my ear nice and snug with the large rubber.  The charging station is nice and I like the fact I can take it with my and basically have a whole day of use with the charging station fully charged.  I haven’t killed the battery on them yet as I’ve only used a couple hours at a time and then put them back on the charger.  The company emailed me also offering a free wireless charging pad and I agreed so time will tell if it actually gets sent to me but seems like a nice gesture.  All around great.  I wanted a decent set of Bluetooth earbuds for work or working out or making calls and these blew away my expectations.  Very satisfied.  Purchase with confidence.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Comfortable enough for 8 hours straight.,"Normally I can't wear earbuds. They hurt my ears or fall out, but these haven't been an issue at all so far. I've had them for about two weeks now and I love them. The sound quality is comparable to a pair of expensive headphones that my husband wears. I wore them for an entire 8-hour shift, and not once did I have a problem with them. I love them and highly recommend. I am also considering buying my husband a pair for Christmas this year.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds for a good price.,"I had bought a pair Jlab JBud Air Executive from Best Buy for $70. Got them home and one of the buds would not power on. Took them back and decided to try these for $50. Glad I did. These are great earbuds for the price. I have to say a couple things though. First the instructions indicate to try all the ear pieces to ensure you get the right ones for you. I started with the ones that came on out of the box. They seemed to fit and be secure in my ear. While using them the sound seemed to be louder in one ear. I could press the less loud one to make it sound the same but it would not stay when I let up on it. I tried the smaller ear pieces and they fit into my ear canal more completely and everything was even and sounded louder. Second, tweak your EQ. They sound was not very good until I adjusted the equalizer settings and it made a world of difference. I would definitely recommend these once I made these changes.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I like them,"I use these at work where most of the time I’m sitting at a desk (just want to be rid of the cords, stop flinging my phone across the room when I forgot I’m attached to it) and they work great! I usually use just one of the earbuds and that works fine, I take them both out of the case to connect and then I put one back in, it disconnects but then the other keeps working. The sound cuts in and out when you walk with your sewing hone in your pocket which is annoying so I imagine these aren’t great for jogging/bouncy sports. Haven’t tested water proofing, can’t imagine needing it, I dont think these would stay in my ears while swimming anyway.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Final Update: Five Stars.  The Ear buds are great and the seller is better than great,"Final Update:  The replacement ear buds arrived today and they are perfect.  I testing the microphone immediately and it worked just great.  Kudos to the seller for reaching out to me.  The ear buds sound great and function perfectly.  Love the wireless charging via the Qi pad.
Updated: The seller reached out to me and is sending me a new pair of earbuds.  I'm updating to 4 stars for good service.  I'll update when I can test the new ones.  I will test the microphone.

I had to change my rating from 5 to 3 stars because I’ve now had a chance to try some phone conversations.  The mic is near worthless.

These blew me away!,"For $50 this has gotta be hands down the best pair of wireless headphones for the money. I also have a pair of Bose SoundSport (Bluetooth not true wireless) and yeah they do sound better but with a price tag nearly 2.5x higher, I honestly don't think they sound 2.5 times better. You can feel the sub bass with these and they're plenty loud to cancel out noise at least while music is playing, and the included charging case is a plus over the Bose for battery life. I use them at the gym while distance running and I haven't had an issue with sweat or them falling out.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Very Impressed!,This is a very well built and great sounding set of ear buds. Not many ear buds stay in my ears but these do.

I highly recommend these earbuds,"These earbuds are absolutely fantastic for the price! The audio quality is great and has some surprisingly good bass. The batteries in the earbuds work for hours before they need to be charged, and the charging/holding case can charge the earbuds multiple times before the case itself needs to be charged. They fit snugly into my ear and don't feel like they're going to fall out when I move my head around. The Bluetooth range is also fantastic! I have no trouble staying connected to my phone if I leave it in a different room on the other side of my apartment. The build quality is solid to the point that they're also quite waterproof.

I have small ears so getting the different size earbuds was appreciated. When I wear these are the gym they stay put- even when i run on the treadmill.

Great customer Service - Occasional sound issues,"The sound sometimes sounds echo-y, like there is a millisecond delay between one earbud and the other.  It usually rights itself within a minute.

The click to pause is less convenient than being able to tap.  You have to grab the earbud to do it or push into your ear, which is uncomfortable, to pause.

But generally, good.  The fit is good.  No problems keeping in my ears.  Pair with my iphone easily.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not good audio quality,"Pretty disappointed with these earbuds, I really wanted to love them. Unfortunately, the audio quality is pretty bad to be honest. The left earbud seemed to be softer for some reason which I couldn't understand, people couldn't hear me very well, and almost every time I wore them - the audio connection would sputter in and out (and this is when I'm holding it in my hand, not many feet away). Also, I had to JAM it into my ear every time I wanted to tap the button, not easy to use AND if you tap twice, instead of switching the song, it redials your last number?? What stupid functionality.

Misleading information. Only can use right earbud alone.,"I really wanted to like these headphones after seeing all the reviews. I am not sure what the expectations where for the other reviewers but these headphones did not even come close to my expectations. Below are my issues with the headphones
1) Made for only one size of ear. It did not come with any extra ear pieces for different size ears.
2) This was the biggest issue with me, you are only able to use the right earbud alone. The left one (or slave one as stated in the instruction manual that came with it) cannot be used by itself. No where does it state this by the way in the manual or in the item description that I could find. This means that when the right one runs out of battery life, you have no headphones. This is very misleading not including this information in the description or the manual.
3) I am not sure as to what the 4 blue lights are supposed to indicate in the charging case but it showed 4 blue lights when I put the drained earbuds in the case and 1 blue lights when I removed them 2 hours later. I see where people are saying they can get 4 charges out of the case but not sure how that works exactly.
4) Left earbud sounds louder then right one when they are both in. I have never noticed this difference with any of the other earbuds that i have purchased in the past.

I hate having to write this review but now I have to go through the trouble of returning these and purchasing another pair. If the sellers of these earbuds happen to read this, it would be very helpful if you would please put that the left one is useless without the right one. Thanks.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really great sound quality!,"I brought these when my previous Bluetooth headset stopped working. I was nervous at first because I hear horror stories about people losing one of the ear buds.

Out of the box impression and 3 week update,"Just finished trying them out after taking them out of the box. I was hesitant buying these because some people said sound quality was awful, but I disagree! It sounds like you'd expect regular headphones to sound.  I haven't done a workout with them yet, but they seem to stay pretty well in my ears. Not heavy enough to bother me. Easy to use after pairing them with my phone for the first time, just put them in your ears and make sure your bluetooth is on. Haven't experienced any issues with the left earbud.

3 week update: I'll be returning these. They fall out even when I'm sitting. I cant find any accessories to make them fit any better and I cannot be fiddling with my earbuds every 5 seconds during my workouts anymore. I have tried working out with all the different sizes of buds and they fall out and loosen immediately regardless of what size I use. This also eliminates the noise-canceling aspect too, I can hear the people next to me breathe. Btw: the earbuds fell out as I wrote this update sitting on the floor.

Better than the competition for a quarter of the price,"I have had these headphones for about two weeks now and as of now they are the best wireless headphones I have ever purchased/used. Being a college student noise cancellation is extremely important when it comes to studying. The company does not advertise this but with how they sit in your ear, they make things much quieter even when there is nothing playing through them. I am also an avid runner and I know I have had previous issues with other wireless headphone competitors on being comfortable and staying in your ear comfortably when going for twenty mile runs but these stay secure the entire time even after sweating. Another bonus is how loud these get compared to others. When you get twenty miles deep into a run and you need as many distractions as possible at this point and the sound quality and volume the music plays at is extremely impressive.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Great quality but do not sit and stay well.,"The sound quality and noise canceling is excellent. However, I cannot get the product to stay in my ear while I am running. I have used the smallest end bud and still doesn’t work. I wanted this to work so badly because I hate paying the price for Apple AirPods. For someone who does not have high energy work out these might be just fine. :-)",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Big sound in small package at great price,"I love the TOZO T10. The sound is great (surprising bass for such a small package), and at a very affordable price. Setup was very easy and the charging time is short.  I find the TOZO T10 comfortable to wear. Noise cancellation is very good. In making and receiving phone calls the sound is good on both ends for indoor conversations. I haven't tested outside in windy conditions yet. I've already recommended these to several family members and friends.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Questionable first impression later redeemed,"The copy of the Tozo earbuds I received initially worked fairly well  upon receipt with the big caveat of pairing and connectivity issues. Namely, after the original pairing between phone and earbuds, the buds would only connect to the phone if manually selected in bluetooth settings in iOS 12 despite the fact that they are supposed to automatically reconnect to the previously paired device (as almost all BT headphones do). I went through numerous troubleshooting steps including re-pairing with the phone, as well as pairing with other phones and devices. In all cases, the earbuds would pair but not automatically connect for subsequent uses. I contacted Tozo support and they walked me through more troubleshooting, with no change. As a result, Tozo sent me another unit while giving me the option to return the originals (but at my own expense for shipping, which is why I chose not to). Here's where it gets strange. After receiving the new unit, I followed the same pairing steps and got the exact same results until the last time when I forgot to remove the first unit from the BT devices list before pairing the second unit. In other words, both Tozo sets were paired to the same device at the same time. When I realized the mistake, I deleted the first unit leaving only the new unit, and continued testing. From this point on the connection behavior changed; instead of NEVER connecting automatically, now the earbuds would connect automatically after about 15-20 seconds. This is a rather long time considering A) every other BT listening device I own connects in 1-5 seconds (all of them!), and B) the Tozo earbuds turn off after about 30 seconds if no device is connected. Stranger still, after the dual pairing the original unit started to behave in this same way. I was baffled enough by these events to begin to question both my intelligence and my sanity - but then I remember how many times I paired and re-paired with at least 3 separate devices and carefully  and patiently observed the results. Take it with a grain of salt if you must, but SOMETHING happened that caused the earbuds to start behaving differently.

Having said all of this for the sake of completeness, I can actually comment on the typical device characteristics.

Pros:
High degree of waterproofing: I've tested them in the shower, and they can get slippery and pop out but they function fine (this also applies to the case which is also waterproof).

Fit: There are several sizes of tips and if you find the right one, these fit very snugly and do not come out or feel like they are coming out.

Sound: Certainly not audiophile quality, but perfectly acceptable for wireless buds under $50. Compared with my poor fitting Airpods I would say these sound better (and fit way better) for over $100 less.

Wireless charging:  Nifty little feature that is surprisingly useful

Build quality: Both the case and bud look, feel and perform like they are well made with quality materials.

Customer service: The Tozo people are very understanding, helpful and accommodating.

Cons:
Connectivity: Despite the fact that the earbuds are now connecting automatically after pairing, it still takes at least 15 seconds, which is not god, especially since every once in a while they refuse to connect and I find myself waiting and waiting until realizing that I have to intervene. Also, the connection between the right and left buds appears to be relatively weak. I noticed this when trying to use them while lying down. As soon as my arm/elbow covers up my ear, the connection begins to skip in and out. This stops when I lift my head. Cupping my hand over one ear has the same effect. I have not experienced any issues, though, during walking, running, etc.

Unfortunately, due to the connectivity issues (both the problems in the beginning which wasted a lot of my time and the ongoing peculiarities) I cannot give these 5 stars, but for the majority of use cases at $50 or less, it would be hard to find a unit that has all of the Tozo's features and still works relatively well in all respects.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I ordered for work but great as well for play,"I use my earbud/earbuds for work to talk to clients .... I'm also OCD and wanted to eliminate wires dangling on my desk... my OCD mind can't think in what it perceives as a mess and the wireless charger I've been using since my Note 9 and now Note 10 has one wire anchored to the charging disk and that my mind can deal with.... so my quest to replace my current for a Q1 compliant bud began.  I was drawn to the T10's because they met my criteria but also the high waterproof rating... same as the Galaxy Note... since my business is all with medical often my calls are emergencies and I actually take calls in the shower and out running in the rain. It also said that I can rinse them off under the faucet and that's what I do with my Note as well so added convenience.  But the real surprise came with my music folder...Tozo basically advertised to attract music and entertainment lovers ...so.... I played a variety from Beethoven to Toby Keith, from Pavoratti to Simon and Garfunkel, from Helen Reddy in the 70s to Kellie Pickler in the 21st century...… and my goodness, everything sounded incredible... it was 3D quality.... the singer in the front of me, drummer behind me, musicians on my left and right.... I am in the center of the band!!!  So now instead of swapping back and forth from my Bluetooth buds to my Bluetooth speaker between calls I'm listening through the T10s and let them doing the swapping for me when a call comes through.... that's another added convenience and something else off my desk (the speaker).  Lastly, my price point shopping was between $100 and $200 and these were fifty bucks... but they also came with a no questions asked money back guarantee so with the features they posted I said ""what the heck"".... another thing my OCD mind can't deal with is the clutter of empty boxes laying around... I won't be needing the empty from these buds so I tossed the box.... the only place these buds are going is on the night stand by my bed so they're handy for my ears when middle of the night calls come through from medical facilities!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I am impressed.,"I wanted something I could work out with and I didn’t want to spend that kind of money on AirPods for that purpose so I tried these. They stay in my ears with no issue. They sound great which impressed me. I did have one small issue that seemed to resolve itself. When you first get these, the left earbud may cut out for half a second. This happened a few times, but that went away the more I used them. You can’t beat these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great wireless earbuds for the price, work as described.","I bought these earbuds earlier this month and couldn't be happier with them. They work in the shower and connect to my phone rather fast. They fit in my ears perfectly, and the case has a nice design. The only issue I had with them is that when I connect one earbud and then want to connect the other at a later time I would have to disconnect and reconnect, but this issue is rather minor. Overall, I would recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase wireless earbuds at this particular price range.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Blah blah blah,Even with my phone in close proximity (in my pocket) the Bluetooth would go in and out of connection creates a weird sound especially during workouts. It is/was inconsistent when I utilize it for phone calls. Plenty of times the persons I call say they can’t hear me.,2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome headphones and totally worth it,"These are excellent headphones. I usually have a problem of the earbuds being a bit loose in my ears but these came with easily adjustable ear sizes. They aren’t too huge in your ears either. Without music playing they cancel a ton of noise as it is. Once my music was one or two notches high, I couldn’t hear someone right in front of me. Everything about these headphones are great. My only complaint would be that the battery life is somewhat shorter than I expected. It last about three or four hours but the case and charging them when not in use honestly erases most of my problems.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Crisp, clear sound!","Sound is great! I haven’t worn them in the water, but I love that I can if necessary. I needed to read the directions carefully as one bud pairs to the other first, then pairs to your phone or iPad. So far so good!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Going to buy several pairs!,"These are fantastic. I was a little concerned about what the quality would be like for the price, but they are great. Super easy to set up and pair, and work fantastic.  I am so glad I tried these before shelling out four times as much for AirPods!

I am going to buy several more pairs to keep in different places (office, gym bag), and for gifts!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great bass and volume, not for every ear shape, pairing can take some time","Have been using them for around a week now. Definitely made a right choice buying these.

The bass and the overall sound quality are great - no complaints there. I love the wireless charging case which goes great with wirelessly charging phone if you have one.

Pairing with the phone could be on a slow side at times and ocassionally needs to be initiated from the phone (or maybe I set up something wrong).

Finally, my biggest concern is that these don't fit nicely everyone's ears, mine included. They don't fall out, they sit firmly, but they're sticking out like small antennas. They still work perfectly, it's just that I do look a little silly when I look myself in the mirror. Luckily, it's definitely not a dealbreaker for me.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

From its stellar sound quality and its waterproof capabilities to the ease of use and innovative design, the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds are truly top of the line (and for an economical value I might add).

Enjoying my Tozos!,"Purchased these on 9/20/2019, and so far my Tozos have been great. The packaging is clean and organized, and has a card that includes the warranty registration (which was easy to do as well). It was easy to switch out the ear caps to the correct size that fits my ears. Here are the pros and cons from my experience so far....
Pros
Comfortable. Long lasting battery with quick charging. Simple bluetooth pairing, with no issues.
Cons
You can tap the earbuds to control a phone call (redial, ignore, disconnect), but you cannot tap to control music. It would be nice if tapping could pause, skip to the next song.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Constant Connection Disruption,"I keep trying to use these thinking that they will get better and they just don’t.  I bought these to use at the gym and while biking.  There is a constant connection interruption between each of the earbuds and my iPhone.  Just bending over to tie my shoes causes the sound to cut in and out.  The overall quality of the earbuds and the charging case is fantastic.  Looks very well made, but the electronics is severely lacking.  I’ve had to use my old wired earbuds because these are so frustrating.  Going to look into a return if it’s not too late.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Not bad in-ear wireless, but....","You only get about three hours of listening time before you have to charge these again. Probably not a big deal for some but I use music to improve my daily focus in the office. All in all, these are nice to use on the weekends when gardening outdoors. I don’t end up snagging a wire and pulling out of my ears when wiping off sweat. And the water resistance is a nice quality as I tend to have neighbors who stop to talk while I garden, meaning dirt gets transferred to the surface and I have to rinse off constantly.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The most important thing to know is the fact that sometimes the headphones will  phase  in and out.,"Are use this product for music in particular and working out, and i used it for phone calls as well.
The quality for the phone was OK, sometimes it would be a little interference but not bad it’s really really a great product for those of you who want to listen to the music with heavy bass this absolutely has heavy bass enough heavy bass that it kind of shocked me.

The product quality is great!,"I was surprised by how well designed the product is. The earbuds themselves can withstand swimming (granted, not underwater swimming or diving), sweat, showering, and washing your face. This doesn't mean you should submerge the earbuds in water though. The earbuds also come with 4 different sizes (S, M, L, XL) so that you can pick the most comfortable size for your ears. Getting used to having to kind of turn them in my ear to make them fit snug has been somewhat of a struggle, but other than that, I have no serious complaints for this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, comfortable, but drop outs are insane","I like the way these sound and the way they feel, love that they connect quickly. BUT, the amount of drop outs is pretty insane. I understand that there are interferences everywhere, but this is the first pair of bluetooth headphones that have So So So many drop outs. it's very annoying and makes it difficult to listen to them. Not sure if Im going to keep them. GOing to see what my phone battery needs to be at before this drop out madness begins. So far, the ear buds are charged 100% so maybe it's my phones bluetooth signal. But like I said, I've had many bluetooth ear buds before and these drop out more than is usually acceptable.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Pay more for a trusted brand and save money,"I'd rather pay twice as much for a good pair and save money than throw away $50. I have no time to return these.
The main reason for one star is left ear plugs does not charge, I put them on charge for a full night and the left one says low battery please charge.
They lose connection easily when outside or more than 10 feet away from the phone.
The sound quality is an absolute joke, it's not even bad, it's just flat out joke. Maybe I'm just used to decent headphones from trusted brands.
It's better to pay more and save money.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound! Great Noise Cancellation! Not for Daith Piercings!,I like that they really cancel out the noise!They have awesome sound!!  What I didn’t anticipate and completely forgot about was my Daith piercing! It’s in my right ear and this is the ear bud that is the main controller. No matter how I try to fit it comfortably. It just doesn’t. So if you have a daith piercing I would really consider this when purchasing any type of ear buds that fit tightly in the ear!,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Sometimes I really have to push them in there to stay (and I had to read the directions/watch the video on correct orientation/insertion). But, they haven't fallen out while biking or walking.

Noise cancelation works extremely well,Just got these the other day. I have been able to use them a few times. They work well and charge fast.

Under priced! Totally worth it!,All I can say is that I wasn’t expecting to get such great pair Bluetooth earphones for the price! (They are my first so I was skeptical). Off the bat I was impressed by the packaging so it got me excited to see the products as a whole. I haven’t had any problems with them the Bluetooth range is amazing and I love the waterproof of both the earphones and the case. The case is portable and can recharge the earphones 4 times before having to charge the case again. The case is also wireless charging compatible which makes everything more easy. The sound quality blew me away I was not expecting so much clarity and so much bass! The noise canceling is very effective I can’t hear anything and thats when my volume is at about 10% overall if you are considering getting these you should and if you are not well now you should!

Pairing the earbuds was simple.  The instructions were spot on.  Open the case, take them out, find them in Bluetooth settings and they are paired!

Great for the price but with some creature comfort problems,"I was very surprised by the sound quality upon connecting these headphones for the first time. Pairing was easy and simple(actually paired to my echo first strangely enough).  The only problem I have with them is the touch controls. They have one button per earbud that takes some force to press. this means that you can only play or pause your music without using your device, double pressing is reserved for redialing a phone number while one press can play and pause music as well as answer a phone call and hang up. otherwise they are solid great battery life sturdy feeling contstuction. they even had a full charge of both the case and earbuds right out of the box",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

The Sound of Value for your money,"Overall this was a good purchase.  I found out the hard way that when you use these buds, don't let them touch each other or place them in a pouch or carrier that will cause them to touch.  Keep them in the bulky cradle provided so that they are separated.  The bulky (my only negative) cradle is a pain to carry in your hiking shorts (as I do), but the cradle provides additional battery power should you be on a long hike/run as well as keeping the buds apart.  When touching they tend to disable each other.  I found the customer service department of this company to be very generous & helpful when I encountered a few problems due to my ignorance as stated above.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best wireless headphones I have purchased yet,"Overall I am extremely satisfied with these headphones.

Don't charge or pair anymore,"they worked the first couple times I used them.

Super easy to use,"I've been using these headphones for around three weeks now, and they're great. Pairing is unbelievably easy, just take them out of the charging case and they automatically start pairing. Occasionally the connection is a bit spotty when there's a lot of other Bluetooth devices nearby, but I think that's par for the course considering the price. Battery life is as advertised (over 3 hours) and charging is fast as well (though I haven't measured it exactly). I've also worn these in the shower a few times and they still work, so they are water resistant, but since they are not safe to swim in I will say they are probably not 100% waterproof. Overall these are definitely worth the price.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Falls Out Quicker than you can say TOZO,"It falls out very easily if you have medium sized ears. I have tried all of the different sized ear things that came with the headphones and they didn't solve the problem. I bought these to work out in and they didn't do a great job for that, one jump and they would fall out because of the way the weight is distributed in the product. Because the outside and the body of the buds are so heavy, they fall out of your ears super quickly. Not worth the time and the money to buy and then return it because it serves no purpose.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing,Finally I can walk around or move with out knocking ear buds out of my ears when I hit the cord. These mean freedom!! Very high quality. Magnetically snap into the charging box.

A few days in... they work well for me,"After many annoyances with cheap wired earbuds, I bought these and I'm happy with them so far.

The smallest caps fit me well, they stay in my ears securely, and do a decent job of blocking out noise.

Similar to some other reviewers with Samsung Galaxy S8, I have experienced occasional sound drops (not disconnection) while walking around, especially in a crowded area. Playtime isn't the longest, however, the charging case is convenient.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Fantastic earbuds for $50,"I bought these, GoNovate Airo, 1More true wireless and the $250 powerbeats pro. These $50 headphones totally beat (pun intended) out the powerbeat pro by a long shot.

These have good volume, sound, and good bass. The 1More earbuds might be slightly better (at $99), but I need to do a comparison again.

Highly recommend these TOZO T10 earbuds, for $50 you cant go wrong.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, some functions MAY be lacking...too new to tell","Barely used for a few days, but sound is great!  One caller commented that background noise was still audible, thus my 2 star rating there.  I gave 3 for battery life, as 3 hours is all it touts for streaming, though 5 hours for talking.  I haven't talked that long yet, so can't verify!  Ease of use seems great so far.  My biggest concern is connectivity to laptop for Skype/Webex.  So far it worked only 50% of time.  Jury's still out!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
TERRIBLE,"These headphones were a real disappointment.  They CONSTANTLY cut out, so much that they are useless.  I use them while cutting grass with my phone between my legs, and the left ear bud will cut out every couple of seconds.  They have great sound, and great noise cancelling when they DO work, BUT THEY DON'T.  VERY DISSAPOINTED.  Now I have to buy a whole new set of earbuds and HOPE that they actually work.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Believe the hype!,"One of the best tech buys of all time! Believe the 15k reviews. Delivers great sound and bass. Battery life is about 3-4 hours per charge with a case that can juice them up sufficiently in just 10-15 minutes.

My only negatives are that the case is a tad bulky for pockets and I’ve had a few issues w/ connectivity and the charging mechanism becoming a bit finicky. However, most of these issues were solved quickly by their customer service or Amazon.

Overall, I’m buying these as holiday gifts. They are so easy to use and have proven to be resilient and long lasting.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome earbuds,"I’ve always wanted to get wireless earbuds but could never find any that I liked until I tried TOZO T10 earbuds.  If you are looking for earbuds to find, the ship stops here.

Good when they work,"So I've used these earbuds on 4 different devices and experienced different results on each. However one thing stays consistent, disconnections. Devices used, Note 8, PC(with USB bluetooth adapter), NVIDIA Shield, and iPad Pro. Randomly the left earbud will stop receiving sound for a second then come back. All devices. A couple of the devices the sound was coming through more like morse code. No large distance between me and the device so that shouldn't be the issue. Anyway, for the price, like I said, when they work they're good headphones, but quite annoying to constantly stop hearing audio out of the left ear then it come back.

Edit: Customer support has contacted me regarding my issues and offered to send me a new pair since these seem to be defective. I'll update again once I test them out.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Split decision,"Better than what I had, but the search continues.  I have tiny ears and these are larger than expected, so they are not useful to me on the go or during exercise since they fall out..  On th flip side, my son has tiny ears, but he absolutely loves these (I guess every millimeter counts). Once set up they are super convenient.

WINNER.....A Must Read Review Will Definitely Save You Some Time,"I purchased these three earbuds and compared them. TOZO (ranked #5 in “Earbuds), 4.4 stars from 8300 reviews, took 1st place with ease. The sound..AMAZING. Deep rich base and clear highs. All pair very easily with my iPhone X and functions are all fine. Sound is where O
TOZO steals the show. The other two couldn’t compare, not even close and most surprising...look at the comaparison.

All three were tested with same phone, same song,, same volume and same room with equal ambient noise, which was none. Same thing with a phone call. Same person etc..

PASONOMI: rank #481 in Earbuds, 4.2 stars, 6500 reviews. Which I have no idea how those stats are possible, sound is absolutely horrible. No need to write anything else about these, horrible should be could enough.

MEBUYZ: rank #1880 in Earbuds. 4.4 stars, 1400 reviews. No charging indicator (if that matters to you), you have to turn them on each time you want to use them. The other two connect as soon as you remove them from their case. The sound of these are fantastic, almost as good as TOZO. It fails miserably when it comes to features, in short, they suck.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These are fantastic! Love them!,"I have never used wireless earbuds before so this is my first pair. They are very easy to use. Within 2 or 3 minutes of opening up the package, I was up and running.

Really well built and perfect for the price!,Received these earbuds less than a week ago but i can tell they are well made and sturdy. Of course the sound does not compare to high end earphones like my Sennheiser HD555 or Bose QC 35 II but it does the job very well and it’s the best in that price range. I am happily surprised about the sturdiness and built quality for both the earphones and the charger.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Excellent wireless earbuds for those that wanna great sound at a great price.,"If you're in the market for great wireless earbuds that connect quickly, aren't going to break the bank and have great sound, look no further.

For the price I definitely recommend them. Very satisfied!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo made it right,"At first when I put them on they worked fine. After 2 minutes it decides to cut in and out. No matter what I did, the music would come on and off. They are useless. Cant used them.

I am updating this review. Tozo has contacted me to make it right. I have to say that it was nice to see that they do care for their customer. That is great. Thank you Tozo.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Waterproof or Not?,"I needed waterproof buds, as the primary time these are used is during physical exertion.
First time in use, the buds were working well...except, the left bud, apparently worked too far loose, and plopped into a bucket of water.  I retrieved it immediately and turned the system ""off""...waited for it to dry, and, tried again.  It worked, but after some time (less than a day's typical use) the left earbud began to intermittently lose connectivity (bluetooth).  Put up with this for a few days, then contacted TOZO Customer Service.  They responded asking that I do a manual reset.  After the 'reset', they worked well for a number of hours...but, by the following day, were back into 'intermittent-signal-loss' mode.  I tried 'reset'ting again, then again and then, once more...to no avail.  Contacted Customer Service again - was informed that TOZO was interested in my 5-Star satisfaction...but wanted me to write a review 'first'...
So - looking forward to seeing their response to this review.
Have purchased another set of earbuds that I am not as impressed with, and would like the TOZOs to work well enough to upgrade this to a 5-Star Review.
Will let you know.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
I love them!,"I was very pleasantly surprised how good the Tozo T10 ear buds are. I am an audio engineer and recording artist and appreciate how good the bass comes through these ear buds.

I can recommend these headphones!,"Includingthis product, I have 3 Bluetooth headphones and I love how this is more convenient because it comes with a case to charge the device and I have not noticed heavy disruption.
Pros: its light, waterproof, portable charger to extend battery, has noise cancellation, and the case is extremely convenient.
Con: they're small so if not careful you could lose a pair, nitpicking but no volume control which my other Bluetooth headphones have, there are times the left or right piece may pause but that is better than losing the entire sound and it doesn't happen often which is good.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Survived my washer and dryer. But can’t be used to swim in a pool.,"Lost one of the earbuds and accidentally washed in the washing machine which is pretty bad but then I also ran it through the dryer for an hour and this was after having not charged the earbuds for three weeks.  And after all that I found it and put it in my ear and it powered right up and connected to my iPhone and played beautiful quality audio.

The problem of course is I can’t swim in a pool with it but I can wear it to listen to audiobooks in the shower but no immersion without it turning off on you which I assume the manufacturer designed to do that so as to discourage people submerging it which makes me sad because I bought it to swim in was why I wanted them in the first place.

Other than that I am impressed.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wife loved them!,"I bought these for my wife as an anniversary present. We recently started going back to the gym for the first time in years and she was tired of borrowing my corded earbuds that I currently use. These didn't fit that well at first until we used the smaller little earbuds that they came with then they fit perfectly. She loves that they now fit perfectly and won't fall out of her ears no matter what exercise she is doing or how much she shakes her head.

I tried them on also and the sound quality was amazing on these and is much better then my current corded earbuds I have been using. I'm going to buy a pair of these once my corded earbuds quit working. All in all we couldn't be happier with out purchase. Being able to throw them back in the charger and give them a quick recharge is awesome and very convenient.

Great product for the price!,"So, I liked the idea of having a wireless headphone, but could never get the apple airpods to fit my ears.

Don't Waste your Money,"After seeing 8500 reviews with most of them positive, I figured I would give them a shot. What a waste of time, these 8500 reviews are mostly fake. There is no way that many people are having a good experience with these earbuds.
From the moment I put them in after pairing, the left one started cutting out. It constantly just cuts out and that causes the right one to pause. No matter where I hold my phone, it still does it. With Bluetooth 5.0 it should never happen, but it does and it makes these unusable and are being returned.

Great Sound!,"I love these earbuds. The sound Quality is perfect with lots of bass and treble.

Great Sound!,"These produce much better sound than I was hoping. I like a deep, rich bass and crisp highs. I'm not a huge fan of mids for most of the music I listen to - when I use an equalizer looks like a ""V"" for most things. These really deliver that for me and I'm really pleased. I was hoping the battery life would be better. I sculpt stone and my last set of ""connected wireless"" BT headphones would run all day (6-8hrs). These last about 3hrs. I'm not a huge fan of how they fit in your ears, but my ears are wonky. They come with 4 prs of different sized nubs and the standard size fits in my left ear well and feels stable. I've tried all of the other sized nubs for my rt and none of them feel super stable unless I really jam into my ear canal (not so fun). It's still pretty stable and as long as I'm not dancing around too much righty stays in - it just doesn't FEEL stable and that's a little distracting. I wish they made attachments that would wedge against the cymba of the ear - I think that would warrant 5 stars regardless of the batt life.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality ear buds with great sound and high end feel,"This my 3rd pair of wireless earbuds and these are by far my favorite.

Best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned. They flat out work great!,"The TOZO T10 just flat out rocks in the earbud category. They pair automatically when removed from the charging cradle with no button pushes needed. Ready to go when you are. Sound quality is as good as the high end noise canceling over the ear headphones I own, but so much more convenient. The rare earth magnets in the lid keep the earbuds secure in the case no matter how much they roll around in a backpack. Being water resistant is just icing on the cake.

Amazing Discovery | Awesome device,Today I realize that I can have two devices connected to theT0Z0 headphones. One is connected to my laptop and the other to my cell phone.

Very Happy!,"I labored over the decision of which wireless ear buds to buy for days.  None of the available choices in my price range have all the features I want, and they all have mixed, sometimes highly dubious reviews.

I finally decided on the TOZO T10's, and I'm very happy with them.

Construction of the buds and their case appears to be good and robust.

The waterproofing makes them great for showers.  I haven't used them for swimming, but I would recommend using a larger sized bud than may be comfortable for everyday wear as the addition of water to the mix may cause the earbud to slip out more readily.  This isn't a problem, unless you have really big ear holes since it came with 4 sizes of silicone tips and can use standard replacement tips in whatever size you need.

They do not have all of the control functionality I would like, the button basically answers/rejects calls and pauses/plays media.  It doesn't skip, adjust volume or really much of anything else beyond that.

Call quality is not great, but cupping your hand from the earbud to your mouth definitely makes enough improvement to the mic's pickup to make them functional for calls.

Syncing via Bluetooth is super easy.  The earbuds can both be used singly or paired, and either earbud will work in either ear (when paired together, the R earbud is always the Right Channel  and the L is always the Left).  Signal quality is pretty solid up to 30 feet, I can leave the case and my phone just about anywhere in the house and be anywhere else in the house without losing connection.

The charging case works as advertised.  I haven't had a day yet where I ran out of power, though I have occasionally had to drop to using one earbud so that one can be charging while I'm listening to the other.

Noise cancelation is moderate, as it is more a byproduct of having something stuck in your ear than any sort of purposeful engineering.

They do have the mildly annoying trait of beeping every second for the first 10 seconds or so after they link up, but it does stop just about the time you're trying to figure out WTF.

They may not do everything I want as well as I want,  but they do everything I required and most of what I wanted.  There are undoubtedly better wireless earbuds out there; but, for the price, I don't think these can be beaten.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product! Better than Expected!,"Great product!  I didn't expect this type of quality from bluetooth earbuds.  It works better than my wired head phones.  The sound is outstanding with its bass.  I use these for work and for working out.  When working out these never fall out when i'm running on the treadmill or just lifting weights.  It says last about a few hours per charge, but I used it for work a few times and I got 6 hrs of usage with the headphones still showing 25% left.  These are way louder and crisper than my other earbuds I have.  I can tell the difference between these bluetooth earbuds and my other ones.  The sound is clearer and louder.  The case having wireless charging is also a big plus!  The only thing  I will say that could be improved on atm is the case that holds the earbuds, its just all plain black.  I would've loved like a TOZO logo or something to show off :P.  Will definitely buy again and recommend to others.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

They were so easy to set up and the noise cancelation is amazing. I have to watch out that I don't miss important alarms or something while I have these in! The sound quality is so good, too. I was worried that these were not as cute as the more expensive ones I had returned, but the ergonomic design makes up for it because they are so comfortable and definitely don't fall out!

It's pretty great,"I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute.

I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!

Great buy for price point,"I'd like to preface this brief review by stating I was given a new pair of headphones to test by TOZO.

These are good headphones for several reasons: they're pretty darn loud, the case carries a really long charge before having to plug back in, you can tell when the charge is done without opening the case, and for those that have fully transitioned to wireless charging, all you have to do is place the case on top of a charging mat.

Pretty good sound quality too, I was impressed! Now I need to try them for working out! I walk everyday, so I put these in the charger case while I walk and during lunch to keep them going all day!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
It’s okay,"I wanted to give this a better rating but honestly don’t want to be the reason someone decides to purchase.

"Comfy, stay put, rockin' headphones. Beats out AirPods for me!","Really great, very comfortable set of headphones that stay in place, even with seemingly lots of jostling. Almost comfortable enough to sleep in. They aren't much for noise cancellation- but they aren't meant to be. They way they are put in and fit is quite clever. I immediately appreciated how cushy they were. My husband is completely unable to wear AirPods, they simply won't stay in his ears. These do. The battery life is what it is. But the case is an amazing charger and only takes 20-30 min to go from flat dead to a full charge and you're rolling again. If you just simply drop them in the case every now and then throughout the day, they last quite easily. I bought these over AirPods for myself and I'm glad that I did, 10/10 would buy again. And now having used both... I think I can fairly say this is the better purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sounds with Limited Features,"For the asked price, this product provides great sound quality and accessibility. However, the buttons are unconventional in a way that the buttons allow you to pick up the call, cancel the call, dial the most recent number, and pause/play music. What it can't (it really should have these functions) do is skip the song, go to the previous song, and volume control. Overall, great earbuds with amazing sound quality.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not without their issues,"The sound quality is nice. A little surprising considering the other issues. Sometimes they pair quickly, sometimes it's just faster to manually pair them. Annoying. Sometimes when I pull them out of the case, one earbud dosen't come on. I have to put it back in a couple times before it'll fire up. I find it hard to believe these are bluetooth 5.0, the range isn't very good so its probably wise to keep the device you're running these off of nearby.

Overall, these were $50. Are they worth it? Yeah, the sound quality was better than expected and the case having the ability to wireless charge is nice.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, nice fit, reliable signal, good quality","Ear buds and charger case nicely designed and good quality. Buds come with three different sizes of ear piece, so you can find the ideal fit. Although not ergonomically shaped like some others, they fit very well in the ear and are very secure. I wear them walking the dog and doing yard work and landscaping and they have not fallen out or even come loose. Haven't used them swimming. GREAT SOUND, not at all 'tinny' and with impressive base. Reliable signal from phone to buds. Very easy to set up and after that, they connect automatically. They cancel out external noise very well. Linking up mini-USB for charging case is a little fiddly as there is a waterproof cover for the charging port, which is recessed into the charger case. Heartily recommend and am going to buy again for my teenage kids.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Amazing fit and sound quality!,"I was skeptical about these at first and a coworker told me he had these and loved them. I decided to pull the trigger and pick up a pair. When they finally arrived and I had the opportunity to try them out I was shocked at how well the sounded and fit. Now I’m a bit of an audiophile and have several pairs of Audiotechnica cans and trying to compare there buds to those is like comparing apples to oranges.

I also have to manually connect them every time I pull them out. Using a note 9.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Way Better Quality Than Expected!,"I am really surprised about the quality of these earbuds for the price. Qualtiy packaging, manual booklet, something you'd expect from a name brand product. A much better unboxing experience than I expected.

The case has a nice heft to it and feels strong, like you could drop it or even throw it at the ground and it'll hold together nicely. I love the magnetic clasp, which also feels strong and I have no worries of it coming open on its own. One thing I really wasn't expecting was the earbuds magnetically snapping into the case, so cool!

The buds themselves are nice and light, very comfortable. The paired instantly when I pulled them out of the case (they come partially charged). Connected to my laptop and my phone no problem. I found that when connected to my laptop that if you right click the volume button on the taskbar and turn on Windows Sonic Spacial Sound they sound way better than without.

Ok product so far,"These are the first wireless earbuds I have ever bought. I use them for talking on the phone and listening to music. They were great for a while and then the left earbud would go quiet I have to tap on it to get it to work correctly. Contacted seller they are sending a replacement pair.

Great earbuds for music,"These earbuds are perfect for working out, while jamming to your favorite tunes. They fit perfectly in your ears, especially with the different sized earbuds to choose from. I really enjoy the fact that the case serves as a charger as well. The only semi-negative experience is the talk quality. I didn't buy these for talking so it's not a big deal to me.

Functional/Great Customer Service,"Got these when I lost my much more expensive Bose wireless.  They are fine and well worth the $$$.

Best earbuds ever,"Love these! They're the best earbuds I've ever had.

"Awesome sound, excellent bass, great fit in ears, horrible bluetooth connection","After trying a few off brand earbuds, these were by FAR the best audio quality. I would LOVE to keep them, but the bluetooth connection is just unreliable. The left earbud consistently has problems connecting right out of the charging case and it drops during music playback. Seems to work best when your phone isn't moving, but once you start moving around it goes in and out very badly. Probably going to have to return, and I'm bummed about it... Giving it a couple more days.

Edit: Didn't get better, leaving 2 stars because if you're stationary its ok. But can't give more than that. Unfortunately having to return these.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Earbuds for the Price - 10/10 Would Recommend,"If you are debating about whether or not to buy these or Airpods, buy these TOZO earbuds! First, they literally sound exactly the same to me, despite the immense price difference. Second, they fit better in your ears.

Poor product,"This is a product that doesn't match the facts. The quality is completely different from the online rating. The quality is not good. The opening of the box makes me very disappointed.

Been looking for affordable wireless earbuds that have decent bass and I finally found them.,"Everything I have tried in the past has lacked in some way. These stay in, have decent battery, great sound and are easy to use. Added bonus is definitely the case.

Left Earbud Cuts Out,"The sound quality is good. They are comfortable. And great buy for the money. However, the left earbud keeps cutting out whenever I move my head. This is very annoying.

Best bang for the buck!! No question.,"These earbuds are fantastic!! They sound great!! I’d definitely recommend these earbuds for the cost as compared to higher priced earbuds.

Great for mono horrible for stereo,"In mono when I only use the right it works pretty well. The problem occurs when I want to use stereo. Every single time I try going stereo, the signal will just cut out of the left on and off. It’s horrible. On top of that, even when it’s not strobing, the signal sort of pans back and forth between the two earbuds in the oddest way.

The frequency response isn’t the worst. If you like your headphones bass heavy, this is good. The battery life is incredible and the build quality actually isn’t bad as far as material goes.

If it wasn’t for the fact that I can only use it with one ear I’d give it a 5.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Went in skeptical... came out feeling like a genius!,"So, I originally had my mind set on the Klipsch or Sennheiser wireless earbuds, but after reading a lot of reviews I was worried about spending hundreds of dollars on something that I may not like (I am used to my wireless over-the-ear Sennheiser headphones).

I came across these TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds and was extremely intrigued by the price, reviews and look.  I figured that I'd rather 'test-drive' the earbud format in a less expensive item so I ordered them.

They arrived in 2 days and I eagerly opened the high-end packaging and paired them with my iPhone.  I placed them in my ear and was shocked that my fears were unfounded - they fit very well and even with a lot of rigorous head-shaking I couldn't get them to budge!  I queued up a variety of musical genres and let it rip.... wow!  These earbuds sound better than any of my wired earbuds (more expensive models) and are easily on par with my over-ear models.  Their sound has a nice, full, warm, bass with clear highs.  More than loud enough - I didn't even come close to full volume with any of the songs I played.  Bottom-line?  I love these earbuds and plan to get a second pair to keep solely at work.

Additionally, the warranty setup was quick and easy and there was even a welcome email with an invitation to reach out with any questions or issues (of which I have had none).

Feel like a genius as well by purchasing a pair of these great earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They work.,"I actually would give the product 4.5. I tried 5 pairs and these are the ones that work in the conditions I need them to. I do a lot of trail running so I am out in the sticks so to speak. I do want to mention that the right one works consistently but not so much the left bud. At home they are above average and have range pretty much throughout the house when away from the device. Battery life seem good but I haven't timed it.  Charger is decent weight and I've charged buds up to four times per charge, And the case lid is secure. Good communication with the company.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Awesome Sound Quality and Excellent Price,These earbuds caught me by surprise. I was looking for an IPX 8 earbuds for working out and decided to purchase these. The price was too nice to pass up compared to several other brands. Charging and operation is very simple. I like the charging case and solid feel of the earbuds. The sound is amazing though.

heavy to the ear drum and very large ..,"its ok,but it does not come with extra ear buds for the different ear sizes like in the add, contacted co and you have to reply with all this info like i am trying to waste my time to get free ear caps. NO GOOD .also its kind off heavy to the ear and not sure its a good choice if you are using them for running . i will say it goes dead after about 6hrs of use and they are bulky so if you have small ears or drum its gonna stick out or fall out",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent quality and great sound,"UPDATE:  After over 1 month of use I am VERY pleased with this purchase.  I can wear them with NO irritation to my ears, the sound is still very good, and I am not having any connection issues.  I have learned to always take the right ear piece out of the charging case first and then the left - otherwise they don’t connect smoothly to my devices.  The ear buds stay in my ears whether I’m walking around, exercising, or laying down.  I love how easy and fast they are to charge.

Initial impressions:
The charging case feels nice and sturdy.  It has a strong magnetic closure that securely holds the lid closed.  The ear pieces lock into their slots magnetically as well.  Very well made.

The ear pieces feel comfortable and easily fit in my ears.  It comes with several pairs of ear tips so it is easy to find a good fit.

Out of the box, the ear pieces had a partial charge but not enough to successfully use them - could not get them to pair with each other or my phone.  I recommend before first use, completely charge both the case and the ear pieces.  After charging, the ear pieces worked exactly as described.  They paired with each other within 10 seconds of removing them from the charging case .  Then they easily paired with my iPhone 6s - the Right ear piece shows up in the bluetooth list.  After pairing the first time, they now automatically pair with my phone every time I take them out of the charging case.  I can also use them with my iPad easily.

If you see both a Right and Left ear piece in your bluetooth list turn off you bluetooth and let the earpieces pair together first - you will see a slow blinking blue light on each ear piece when they are paired to each other then turn your bluetooth back on.  You should see only the Right ear piece in the bluetooth list.  Select it and you will be set to go.

My first day using them has been very successful.  I popped my ear pieces in, selected some music, put my phone in my pocket and went for a nice walk.  They never lost connection with my phone.  They seem to have adequate noise cancellation for what they are and I am satisfied.  I like the sound quality - the music sounded rich with good bass.  I don’t like my bass to be thumping loud and these ear pieces seem to have a good balance to them for any type of music.

Overall, Day 1 with this product has been very satisfying.  I am enjoying them very much.  I will continue to update this review.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound,"Sound with Base!!!!
The Biggest Draw back CAN'T skip tracks with these ear buds!

Some Engineer thought is was more important to be able to last redial than skip a track. Most times using my phone as a way to call someone its in my hand and I can redial or call who I want. When listening to music its in a pocket or a holder and it would be nice to skip a track with out touching the phone!!!!",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality set of wireless earphones,"I have found the quality to live up to the cost. The sound quality is as expected from the price point with nice a bass and a respectable mid to high sound range. They definitely fit in my ear better than other wireless headphones that I have tried especially due to both the light weight and the adjustable earpiece sizes that are provided. It is also a plus that the charging case is supposed by wireless charging and the headphones are IPX8 instead of 7 or below. Overall, I would recommend these earphones to friends and family.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Purchase,"I’ve had these Bluetooth earbuds for 2 months now. I love how easy it transfers music from the phone to the car speakers and back. The charging time is great as well. Charging it for about 30-40 mins can last up to 3 hours of listening time. I use it a lot even in the shower. It works great.

Cons:

The bass was great at first but now it’s not at its best. The left bud sometimes acts up and just doesn’t work so I have to put it back in the charger then get it again. It’s not so bad but it can be an inconvenience when you’re in the shower.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound but not the most durable,"I'll start off with the good. The sound quality and base for the price of these is great.

The best investment EVER!!,"These earbuds are so awesome! I wear them in the shower and they have not gotten any water damage. I also listen to them in quite loud places and they do a VERY good job of blocking out the ambient noises. With the right earpieces they also do a good job of staying in you ear! The customer service is also top-notch! They allow you to activate a warranty when you receive it in the mail and are very helpful when you have any issues. Also you could get some free offers ;) .
One other thing that this earbud set has over other, similar earbuds is that the voice it uses to let you know when the battery is low and when it powers on/off isn’t too loud and obnoxious. This is an underrated feature but it means a lot to me because when I’m jamming out to my favorite song I’d hate to have some loud robotic voice screaming in broken English: “Battery Low!

I'm super happy with my purchase and the fact that they're so easy to charge! I've only used them a full day so far, so if anything changes (which from the other posts I'm doubting this) I'll update my review.

"Fall out constantly, odd fit","After I lost one of my AirPods and couldn't justify the cost of new ones, I decided to get these based on the positive reviews. These do their job.... but not without some major issues. The main problem is the size and shape of the earphones. They are too big to comfortably fit in my ears, and so they constantly fall out and/or cause pain. I typically use headphones when traveling or when listening to a sleep podcast at night, and in either situation it's inconvenient to constantly readjust the earbuds as they pop out or put pressure on my ears. Even pressing down on them to turn them on will usually make them fall out. Based on that factor alone, I don't get a lot of use out of these. The battery life is also not the best. I wish that like the AirPods, they would conserve the battery by turning ""off"" when they're not in my ears or in the case.

For the cost I wasn't expecting a lot, and they do their job. Had I known they would be impractical to wear on the run, I would have rather spent more money on headphones I could get more use out of, though.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Sound quality is great,"Technology has come a long way from what it used to be, and wireless headphones/earbuds are one of them. These earbuds in particular are definitely worth checking out. There are so many new wireless earbud technology coming out, and this is one you might want to get. It has some pretty good highs, mids, and even lows. If you want to test out a bass intensive song, these should not disappoint. For complete experience, I cannot really complain about the sound quality. They come packaged neatly with a charging dock that you can use multiple times before recharging the dock itself, so you won't lose your world of music or other uses for the earbuds.

Bought these for my son,"My son is a sport enthusiast, goes tot he gym all the time, plays sports in school, etc.  He loves these earbuds.  He said they are WAY better than air pods and are a LOT cheaper too.  That is a win-win in my book.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Perfect fit and easy operations,"So far so great.  The pairing process with my iPhone 11 was simple out of the box and I have successfully used only one earbud (the left one remains in the case for safekeeping).  The out of the box tip was perfect for my ears, but it is nice to have options.  I have a Choetech proximity charger for my iPhone and I was able to successfully use it to charge my earbuds as well.  Sound-wise I primarily listen to non-music (podcasts and books) and it worked well for both of those.  I like the ability to pause the playback from the earbud rather than having to fumble with my phone.  I have not yet used the earbud for a call, but for what I needed these are excellent.  If anything changes I will update.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality for the money!,"I typed a long review on my phone and all of a sudden it's gone. I'm not re typing all of that 😐

Cliff notes:

I like these headphones. They are my first wireless ear buds ever. Charging case and idea is great and after 3 days so far I am very much enjoying them.

I'll follow up in a few months to see.

Great customer service. I was sent an email for a free wireless charger. That's great service!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Best decision ever!,"These earbuds are amazing! They come very nicely packaged, the instructions for pairing were very simple, and they are comfortable to wear. I'm extremely impressed and can't wait to see how they are for my first run. The little charging carrier came precharged and so were the earbuds! I was able to use right away!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great sound, no volume controls","I usually use my headphones while jogging and had been using a bluetooth pair that were wired to eachother for quite some time.  They sounded great but the jogging action would cause the cable to rub off my clothes which would be conducted straight to my ears.  So I decided to jump on the bandwagon and get this pair of wirefree headphones.
Pros:  The sound is excellent.  The trebles are clear, the bass is rich without being overpowering or murky.  I have had very few problems with signal drops (if I put one earpiece in my rear pocket when talking to someone then the signal may drop out).  Also these seem to stay put in my ears with no problems whatsoever.
Cons:  No volume control.  This is a very big con though.  It's ok if you're listening to music via a PC or a phone and then you can use the volume control on the device.  However I primarily watch TV when I'm on a treadmill and use the Amazon fire stick.  Since the default connection volume setting for the headphones is ""blow your eardrums out"" this presents a huge problem.  The Fire Stick doesn't have volume controls (although the newer versions do).  As a result I cannot use these headphones for the primary reason I got these headphones to begin with.
I've only made one phone call with these earpieces and while I could hear the caller without issue, they claimed they had a very hard time hearing me (however this call was done via skype so it may not be the earphones issue).
All in all, I'm giving these headphones 3/5 starts.  The audio quality is amazing, but the lack of volume controls is a big issue for me.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Can’t get it stay in my ears no matter what I do.,"I tried all of the different ear plug sizes, but they never sit firmly in my ears.  Can’t get it stay in my ears if I move at all.

Sound quality is below average with very little base.

I’ve used mostly bud ear phones all my life and these are by far the worst.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Sound and Great Fit!,So surprised at the fabulous quality of sound with these headphones.  Love the fact that they came with different sized buds for a great tight fit.  Absolutely no problems with their performance in the pool when I’m doing laps and aerobics!,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality headphones at a spectacular price!,"Great affordable headphones. Pair easily and sound spectacular.  Probably the best Bluetooth headphones I’ve had.
I’ve used them at work and it’s so nice to have the charging case to put them in. One thing I would like better though is a slightly slimmer case that doesn’t feel so bulky in my pocket.
I have also used them for running and they are perfect. No more cable bouncing around while I run and these bad boys stay put for 3+ miles with a guy who sweats a lot.
I have not tested the waterproof side of them but if they can handle my sweat from running then surely they could stand up to a little dip in water.
They charge with my non Tozo wireless charging pad, I’m going to have to buy another so I can continue to charge my phone wireless at night.
Oh an the battery last at least 3 hours on one charge in the case, all together I can get 3 and a half charged out of a fully charged case.
Overall I’d say give them a shot. If you don’t like them you can always return them.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
earpiece beeps every 10 seconds for 2 full minutes after successful connection,"PROS:
1. 1 year warranty (needs to be activated, instructions are included in package)
2. comfort: good
3. charger: functional for the 30 days i had it. its nice that it comes with a 1 year warranty. make sure you register your warranty to ""activate"" it.
4. showerproof: functional for 30 days I used it. i put a small strip of packaging tape over the mic hole though. just to be safe.
5. bluetooth range and connectivity: max range is 30 feet for me. which is better than most v4.X bluetooth. no drop outs in media or phone calls.
6. video audio lag: none

CONS:
1. sound: treble is a too high. an EQ setting: ""treble reducer"" can remedy this somewhat. bass is ok, not good or bad. high treble is annoying.
2. THE BEEPING.
if you use just one earpiece and connect it to your smartphone, it will continue to beep every 10 seconds for 2 full minutes. this is to notify the user that the earpiece is searching for the other earpiece. which is dumbest design idea ive ever seen.
just tell the user in the manual/online that the earpiece will search for the other earpiece for 2 minutes after successful connection. also you can just change the pace the LEDs flash to indicate this searching process instead. i only use one earpiece at a time. the battery for each earpiece only lasts 3 hours. so you can imagine how annoying this gets on a daily basis.

conclusion: i am returning this product for the extremely annoying beeping ""feature"". knocking off 2 stars for this, and 1 star for the high treble audio.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Product and Customer Support,Initially not satisfied but their support was amazing. Quickly sent me another pair that sounds and works great. The different size ear pieces ensure you can select a pair that fit snugly in your ears. Can easily control calls and music with a tap on the ear piece. Bass was especially great,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great Sound. Great Fit. More bang for my bucks.,"I was looking to purchase a good pair of wireless ear buds primarily for daily use at work. These work very well for that purpose. I am “FREE” to move around the office without the aggravation of cords. The noise cancelling is nice because I work in a cubicle, and I can focus without all the external noise. The sound quality is great!!! I almost bought a more expensive set, but I’m glad I didn’t. These have exceeded my expectations .",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Quality earbuds - well thought out design!,"I was super excited to get these, as I hate how it’s impossible to charge my IPhoneX while using the wired headphones.

I’ll admit I had a bumpy start with them - mainly because I was bull-headed and thought I could just figure them out as I do with most electronics I purchase. Learn from me: do check out and follow the included instructions!

I clearly didn’t properly “pair” them properly or reset when I ran into issues with glitchy connections (or the left earbud losing the signal). When I did this, however? Amazing results.

This earbuds are pretty remarkable given the price - great sound and I absolutely adore the carrying case / charger. It’s so simple - you wonder why this concept wasn’t born sooner.

Overall, love this purchase and hard to imagine going back to the white, tangled cords of death!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Light weight, great fit, stay in ears","I bought these earbuds for running after using earbuds that connected behind my head.  Initially I had liked those, since they gave me more freedom when working out than the headphones that plugged into my phone.  After awhile, I got frustrated with them since the cord around the back of my neck would snag on my clothes when working out.  It also made it difficult to wear just one earbud.  So I decided to take a chance on these wireless earbuds and I couldn't be happier!  They fit just snug enough in my ears that they stay put without any irritation.  The sound quality is great.  It is so nice to be able to listen to one earbud without having to worry about any cords.  And for added convenience, the charging case makes it easy to charge them anywhere!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
great product,I was looking for headphones to workout in. This have worked amazingly. They stayed in my ears without moving throughout my workouts. I have even started using them at work too. I can wear them without them becoming uncomfortable for a couple hours. They block out almost all outside noise which is great at the gym. The sound they provide is very high quality. I would highly recommend them.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great earbuds just dont take them to 1 North,"There awesome for the price.. love them.

Finally! Exceeding expectations with Bluetooth earbuds,"I’ve now worn these through at least 10 charge cycles and they’re fantastic.

PROS
-sound quality is excellent with great bass that’s not overdone either
-charge time is short. Earbuds charge up quickly on the go (just in the case) AND when needed the case re-charges quickly
-easy to understand/ intuitive LED lights in the case and on the earbuds
-great Bluetooth range if I need to leave my phone on the counter charging
-zero issues with Bluetooth going single channel
-comfortable to wear for hours!

CONS

Amazing Earbuds!!,"I absolutely LOVE my new ear buds!! They are extremely comfortable and the noise cancellation is outstanding!!! I work in a loud warehouse & when I have them in, I can’t hear anything but my music & the sound quality is fantastic!! The case is compact and easy to travel with. They also charge very quickly. I have purchased 2 different brands in the past, but none of them can compare to my TOZO’s. I am very pleased in every aspect from the price, quality and ease of setting them up. Customer support is extremely helpful. You won’t be sorry if you choose TOZO!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
No Bluetooth range,"I purchased these, and then sent them back.  The range of the Bluetooth is about 2 feet line of sight.  If you put your phone in your pocket the signal keeps dropping.  They also fell out of my ears easily.  A few times I had to turn them on and off because the left ear would not sync with the right ear.  Maybe I just got a bum set but this is what I got.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent wireless earbuds,"I have tried many wireless earbuds, but these earbuds so far has the greatest volume capacity, sound quality, and rechargeable charging case. The only downside to this product is the button functionality where it is optimal for calls rather than music. So if you want to increase the volume, skip a song, play a song back, or stop/resume a song from playing, you will have to do it from your device instead of being able to do it with the earbuds.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Great ear buds, case and support!",This is the 2nd pair that we have purchased for our family.  They shipped right away.  Had an email from the seller making sure that the product was to our liking.  Has a 1 year warranty.  The ear buds charge in the case that is fast and convenient!  Love these ear buds and would highly recommend.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good Quality,"SO FAR, this product is exactly what it says it is.  However I'v bought these kind of devices in the past, after few months of use you start realizing their ""buggs"".  As of yet don't see anything wrong with them even call quality (and i'm pretty much deaf in my left ear) is amazing, best I have ever experienced.  Music quality is like no other, bass is so amazing I was impressed!! So over all AGAIN SO FAR, this product is really, really good!!  I will continue this review in about 3 months if I find any crap with these.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really Good,"I was skeptical and compared reviews from this Tozo T10 to the Samsung Earbuds and the reviews were pretty similar.  So I thought I would try the $50 risk instead of the $130 risk.  I can say that I'm very happy with these earbuds.  I have a Samsung Note 8 and I haven't had any problems with disconnects/quality.  I've only had them for a few days, so I will update if things change.

Pros:
- Sound is great for small earbuds and the bass is great and punchy.
- Connection is really good for me, so far I haven't had the connection issues others have reported.  Both earbuds stay connected while the phone is in my pocket or sitting 30 ft away.
- Wireless charging ability is awesome and the earbud case is great and feels solid
- My fit was perfect, I had my kids/wife try them on and they were loose, so I can see some people having issues with smaller ears.  I would consider mine medium sized and they are perfect.  Since they fit well, I also can't hear anything when I'm wearing them, which makes them perfect for cutting grass, etc...

Cons
- The side buttons only have the following features (Play/Pause, Accept/End Call, Reject Call, redial last number).  This is a con for me because I wish it had volume and or next track.  I will be using these for music not phone calls.  It would be even better if they could make one earbud control music and the other control phone calls

Overall I am very happy with these.  If they fix the volume/music thing on the Tozo T11 they will be perfect.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Amazing Piece of Technology,"With these wireless earbuds, I am now able to enjoy my music in the shower, truly an amazing experience. I personally enjoy the cancelling of outside noise and the deep bass these earbuds provide. I have these on during weight lifting and do not have to worry about wires getting tangled up due to it being connected to my phone. I can now set my phone on the side, do my lifts, and not worry about having anything in my pockets getting in the way of my lifting, especially dead lifting where the bar is gliding up your legs and constant hitting your phone that's in your pocket.
5/5 would recommend.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Replacement pair is perfect.  Feature-laden.,"I had a pair of these in black but lost them.  When researching options, I came back to this brand because others don't offer IPX8, wireless charging, and the attractive compact size.  Sound quality is the same as before: balanced and perfectly acceptable.  Wireless interference wasn't a problem like my very first set before a quick and easy exchange with Amazon.  Happy with this product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They fit perfectly. There's a trick tho,"These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever purchased. The battery life is amazing. The case is amazing, it's constantly charged. The fit is amazing. Now regarding the actual fit there was a trick that I did to make them fit perfectly. If anyone is use to work earplugs you know that the recommended way to apply them us to pull (the top of) your ear back and I sent the plugs in. Now, same applies to these headphones. Pull your ear back and insert each headphone in while twisting it clockwise. Once you let go of your ear the plastic piece will form to your war canal and create a perfect fit. Once I did this trick the fit was amazing, the sound was incredible the bass is 10x better. Totally recommend!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the price!,"These headphones work great for running, the don't fall out and I am going on day 3 with no charge. I listen to audio books a lot, and even gave these a test while showering. So far no fail on the waterproofing. You can keep volume at a relatively low level due to how well these cut off noise.
My only complaint is that the left earbud loses connection to the right. It happens if I set my phone on the counter and walk around my kitchen, the right earbud keeps playing perfectly clear but the left one starts to drop out at about 3 ft.
Still, the price is good and they sound decent",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Updated Review- WOW,"So I was truly disappointed originally with my first experience, the left bud just completely stopped working after the very first time I used it. I wanted to return them, but i didn’t quite have the time to go to UPS to resend it. The seller actually reached out to me and offered to replace my broken set! I’ve been using them for a few weeks now and they continue to impress! The sound quality is awesome, a little tricky to get them to stay in your ear but remember to adjust the ear pieces that it comes with and follow the instructions! Worth every penny :) My experience with customer service was truly what lead me to update my review. Just know they’ll take care of you if you need them! Outstanding!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good sound but not perfect overall,"Pros: easy to connect to Bluetooth, good sound to me, great noise cancelling, comfortable with extra ear pieces in a different size, carrying case that also charges them

Cons: no mic in order to answer a phone call, battery life is just over 2 hours.

I bought these to listen to audiobooks or music while cooking. I’ll probably be shopping around for a different set though because the biggest complaint I have for my personal use is that the sound cancellation is almost too good. I can’t hear much of anything if the music is at a moderate volume. This would be great in some situations but I’d like a bit more room awareness and phone call connectivity with my everyday earbuds.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Maybe look somewhere else...,"I've been using the Tozo T-10's for about a month now, so I feel like I've used it enough to write a fair review. The sound quality of the ear buds is ok. Nothing terrible or great to say about it, but that's what I was expecting given the low cost compared to some of the name brand wireless earbuds. The bass is pretty weak and some rock music can sound staticky. The biggest issue with the sound is actually how frequently it'll cut in and out. My phone is in my pocket the vast majority of the time, so distance should not be an issue. I never had this issue with another brand of wireless headphones I got on Amazon, so I know it has nothing to do with my phone or the app I'm using. The biggest disappointment though has been the battery life. The battery life of the earbuds themselves is close to what's advertised, given that I probably listen at a volume higher than they tested; however, the battery life of the carrying case is terrible. I charged both earbuds and the case to full and used the earbuds until they were drained. When I put them into the case to charge, it only had 1 charge left...after not having used it once after a full charge. For those of you who are still on the fence, I think it's worth saving up for a bit and buying yourself a more reputable brand of wireless earbuds.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Works as advertised,I really wanted a pair of wireless earbuds but didn't want to break the bank getting them. I came across these and all the positive reviews and decided to give them a try. I was surely not disappointed. The sound quality was great and had excellent bass and thanks to additional buds provided I was able to find the right size to fit in my ears. They are water and sweat proof though not submersible according to the instructions and I tested them out by wearing them in the shower. No problem so far and at this point I would definitely buy them again.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Really wanted to like these!,"I really wanted to like these. I had issues pairing these, keeping the connection, and issues with the buds reconnecting after pairing. I would pull them out of the case and they would simply beep at me, it would take upwards of a minute to pair to the phone and I had to go into my bluetooth settings to reconnect a known device. No reason for this. The sound was decent, bass was decent but it seems that the vacuum seal when they twisted into my ears caused instant headaches from the pressure. Didn't even know this was a thing as my other in ear headphones do not cause this problem. But some research on Google confirmed I'm not the only one to have this problem. Earbuds also do not work independently of each other. There are questions and answers on here that are mixed about this but I can confirm they do not work this way.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Superior to the competitor's earbuds in every way!!,"I purchased the Tozo T10 earbuds for my wife after purchasing a competitor's bluetooth earbuds that she was not satisfied with. The competitor's earbuds were hard to pair, had poor noise cancellation,  have clunky function buttons on the earbuds, have hard to understand and incomplete written instructions and the earbuds made her ears sore.

When the Tozo T10's arrived, we were impressed with the premium packaging right out of the box. The T10's are very easy to pair, the written instructions are clear and thorough, the sound quality is outstatnding as is the noise cancellation, the earbuds have integrated touchpad function buttons, and they are very comfortable in her ears - all superior to the highly rated competitor's earbuds. In addition, the T10's have a sturdy, water proof case/charger that includes a free lanyard to fasten it to a backpack, purse straps, etc. The earbuds and case include excellent battery charge indicator lights. The T10 case can be charged with the included USB cable or wirelessly if you have a wirelss charging pad or stand - an excellent feature! I actually charged the case using the Wireless Powershare feature on my Samsung Galaxy S10 phone. Also included are 4 sets of silcon ear adapters in different sizes for a comfortable, custom fit. The earbud touchpad function buttons make it easy to powere on/off, pause/play media, and answer/reject or hang up from a phone call. The instructions included Tozo's website URL and a scannable code to access their website for support, instructions and warranty registration.

"Comfortable wear, great sound, easy to pair and excellent call clarity","I wanted this type device - 2 separate units versus a connected pair - for a while now but waited until the technology was more stable.  Take these out of the charging base and they connect to each other and then your device really, really quickly.  The sound is crisp and clear.  You use your device to control the volume and song advance as there aren't controls for those on the units...but that's actually a better approach in my opinion as finding tiny buttons while exercising usually is an error filled event.
The call clarity is very good and I have not had any drop outs or complaints of muffled speech.  I like these a great deal and think they are an excellent product.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
These earbuds should be 6 stars,"I am a senior citizen who has ALWAYS had trouble connecting any kind of headset via bluetooth to any kind of device.  I am so happy to have found the TOZO T10 ear buds.  The directions for pairing were so simple that I was suspicious I would have trouble.  Far from it.  All I had to do was:  take the earbuds out of the black box.  The right bud started flashing red/blue and then connected to the left bud all by themselves in my hands!  I went to my bluetooth menu on my phone and there was ""TOZO-T10-R"".  One tap and I was connected.  You follow the directions for inserting the earbuds and they are very, very secure.  It comes with 4 sizes of buds.  I changed out the originals for the smallest size.  I reinserted the buds, found a song to play on my iTunes, and OMG!!  Everything worked!!!  And the sound quality is fabulous.  My old ears usually miss half the words on a song, but I could clearly hear every word!  How wonderful!..And a quick tap on the right earbud puts it in pause.  Another tap and I'm back to the song or book or whatever.  These earbuds do exactly what I've needed all these years.  Thank you TOZO.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Bluetooth connectivity issues between earbuds...,"**Update 5/10/19**

The exact same issue is happening with the replacement earbud set. Right ear stays connected to the phone and has no issues what so ever. The Left earbud drops signal every 1-2 seconds. No amount of resetting fixes the issue. Very disappointed.🙁

RMA requested. They’re going back.

**Update 5/8/19**

I’ve just received the replacement set of the Tozo T10 IPX8 earbuds. They were new, in a sealed box. Pairing with my phone and the two buds went without a hitch. Initially upon first use of the replacement set the left earbud did disconnect from the right earbud a couple of times so I performed the factory reset and there have been no issues. I will put them through the paces over the next 24-48 hours and update again. Still have not heard from Tozo. 🤨 Thank You again Amazon Customer Service! You’re the BEST!!

****************************************************
I liked the look of these earbuds. The reviews sold me so I pulled the trigger on this purchase.

I like the fit and sound. Really like the dedicated charging case that can be wirelessly recharged.

Pairing with my iPhone 7 was easy and the pairing process between the buds was just as easy. They didn’t or haven’t fallen out of my ears. Used them for about a half a day and the Left bud started to lose connectivity with the right ear bud.

After trying the reset recommended in the owners manual I still had the same issue so I contacted Tozo’s customer service via two separate e-mails. Waited 24 hours and heard nothing from them. So I escalated my issue to Amazon’s customer service team who came to the rescue.

Great wireless headphones for the price,"These were really easy to sync to my iPhone. The battery lasts all day if I’m listening to music or talking on the phone. The sound is clear and the bass is decent. Phone conversations are clear. The noise cancellation is great when music is playing, but I can hear surrounding noise when music isn’t playing. The carrying case is compact enough to fit in my purse, but a little too bulky for jean pockets. It comes with different size pieces for the ear holes, which was perfect for me because I have tiny ears and the set it came with didn’t fit. Really good product for the money! I had older iPod earbuds and these sound and function just as well.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Not Worth $50,"Not worth $50. If you're just looking for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds to wear around the house, then they might be worth picking up if you can get them for $30. They don't fit well with smaller ears and tend to fall out with mild activity. Even if they do fit well, the left earbud cuts in and out frequently when jogging. Sound quality is about what you'd expect for the price. Everything sounds a little muddled and there's very little noise cancellation.

Overall I'm not happy that I spent $50 on these, and I'm even less happy that they're now on sale for $30 a few days later. Not sure how they have anything above a 3 star rating honestly.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Wonderful well engineered product,I was pleasantly surprised with these earbuds. Fantastic sound. Stay in your ears even with vigorous head shaking. Spoken connection and on/off status is very complete. And case battery charger is wonderful. LED displays on inside and outside to indicate charging level. Wireless charging for the case make life a breeze. No more fiddling with charging cables. Very satisfied with this well engineered product.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Extremely impressed overall and great price to match,"Taking into consideration the very affordable price my expectations were far exceeded. Overall I was very impressed with the sound quality, comfortable fit and feel, battery life of the compact earbuds was very suitable to my desires and the waterproofing....works great!! I’ll return to my personal experience addressing my pleasure with the waterproofing of the earbuds.

The only negative aspect I have to mention about the earbuds was already addressed by the seller. That problem being would be the connectivity of the earbuds, the first set I received I had issues with the left earbud cutting in and out of connection. The seller immediately sent me a replacement at my request.
The second set, no such issue thus far after nearly a week, the one year extended warranty is also very reassuring that if they do present any issues it will be taken care of.

Waterproofing, works very well on the first day of trying my replacement pair I didn’t have the earbuds properly secured and lost it in a solution I believed would indefinitely render the earbuds useless. Removed and powered off and dried off, two hours later, back to jamming out to my tunes and finishing the installation of the diesel pump I was working on. Several days later they are still playing like new. I love them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Truly a great purchase,"Truly a great purchase.  So I was going to purchase the Apple air pods.  I couldn’t bring myself to spend all that money. I really appreciate Amazons reviews and therefore chose to go that route and fell upon these earbuds. Simply put I am extremely thankful and happy with them. I don’t need to necessarily have studio sound quality but I am very much not lacking in overall performance, sound, and quality. I am happy to have this economic alternative which works well. Simply put… I full heartedly recommendation these!!!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, short battery life and Not good for phone calls","When they connect correctly they work great for listening to music, movies and videos although they are NOT good for phone calls. Also the battery life is said to be 3 hours and I barely make it to 3 hours so I'm returning them. I bought them with the intent of using them while working, working out and to talk on the phone and need to keep my hands free. So although they do work and sound great I'm not a fan of the battery life and that they don't well with calls.",3.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Excellent all around wireless headphones,"Best $50 I have spent in a while. I do a lot of outdoor activity in the Colorado mountains and these headphones have not budged from running to downhill mountain biking. Love that I can just wear one of them and listen for other bikers or joggers with the other ear. Connection and sound quality is excellent. Charging Case works great, wireless charging is a bonus. Worked great on a recent flight as well. Absolutely no complaints.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"A nice product, with a few caveats","I bought this product after becoming intrigued at the prospect of completely wireless earbuds, with a case that was capable of charging. I spend a lot of time on my phone, between listening to audio and making and answering phone calls while working from home. The addition of the waterproof factor was also something that was really interesting to me, since I do run and get caught in the rain sometimes.

While I'm still impressed with the audio quality and waterproof factor, I did run into a few annoyances once trying these out, which make be dealbreakers for other buyers. While you can start and stop audio or calls using the buttons on the units, you cannot control volume at all, unless you do so on your phone. I also found that call quality was TERRIBLE, and those I was talking to on the phone often couldn't understand me. The earbuds were also often slow to connect to Bluetooth - I even had to place them back in the case and remove them again to ""restart"" the pairing process a time or two. Battery life was shorter than some of my other bluetooth earbud units, but still long enough for a good run and a few hours of around-the-house listening.

I will say that I contacted the seller upon experiencing my issues, and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience, acknowledged the issues, and offered me a partial refund (I believe I bought this product when it was priced on the higher end of its average). I was very impressed with their prompt response and interest in maintaining good customer service. My understanding is that they intend to work on these issues and improve them in future models.

Despite the issues experienced, I do think the product is worth the purchase, as long as user expectations are realistic. If you don't talk on the phone with them, have use for the waterproof factor (it IS really cool being able to listen worry-free in the bathtub), and are prepared to adjust volume on your phone, they're a really nice little ""spare"" buy. I just wouldn't pay my original purchase price of $50 for them.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good sound, bad battery life and connection consistency","Good sound, strong bass. Worked well for 45 min to 1 hr workouts. The battery life started degrading about a month after using the product and now the right ear bud runs is intermittent when turning on and needs charging immediately. Also, they sometimes connect to the device when in the charging station which has caused some problems with phone calls and listening to music.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great fitting wireless earbuds with fantastic sound.,My husband and I both purchased a pair to try for working out. Out of the box they paired very nicely without any issue.  (Bonus.....They don't conflict with each other when both sets are on) The fit is snug inside the ear WITHOUT adding extra pressure and making them uncomfortable to wear. The noise cancellation was quite an added surprise. It blocks more than enough so that listening to your music or whatever is enjoyable.  They do have GREAT sound quality. nThe bass was perfect. Sweating in them is not an issue. Overall we are very pleased with our purchase and would recommend these ear buds. to others.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Well worth the money!,"I’m a 73 year old walker. I love these T10s. Pairing them with iPhone X was a breeze, and they hook up to it before I even get them in my ears. They have a great sound and stay in place until I elect to remove them. The case they come in is jewel of thoughtful engineering. Easily charges the earbuds multiple times even when it’s unplugged. Magnets in the case hold both the buds firmly in their sockets for charging and the lid down to protect them. The lid is smoke grey, but translucent so you can see the charge level of both the case and the ear buds. I’ve charged the case both via a wireless charger and via the USB C connector. Both ways are fast and flawless. All and all, a great buy with an eager to know your satisfaction level service department.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Won't stay in my ears...,"The sound quality is good, but there are two problems.
-  Connecting to your device is difficult, as each bud has to connect to each other, things often get confused when trying to connect to the device.
-  The earbuds do not stay in my ears while running.  It seems like they would work if you were on a gym machine with no vertical movement (elliptical, rower, recumbent bike, etc.), but whenever I go for a run, they come loose about every 30 seconds.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Terrific value and sound quality,I have been impressed with the comfort on the T10 Earbuds and the sound quality. I find the sound to be full and rich and well balanced between bass and treble. Service has been exceptional and I have received an unexpected free wireless charging station from TOZO for buying the earbuds! Great valve for the price and highly recommend.,5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Awesome,"Bought these for work. I work in a huge boat building factory 10 hours a day. Can hear it perfectly. I use one til It dies which is about 5 hours into the day, and then use the other one. I don't like how I can't skip songs on the headphones. Gotta pull out my phone Everytime but other than that, they're great. I charge the box on Sunday and it keeps the headphones charged until Thursday. Awesome",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Liking It So Far,I had these wireless earbuds for about a week and I have been enjoying them. I like the sound quality and was easy to pair to my devices. The negatives are when using it on call at times the other person cannot hear me but on most calls they hear me clearly. It is however better than other wireless earbuds I had where the other party could not hear me at all. Another thing I noticed is when I use it with my tablet at times there is a slight delay with the audio when streaming shows. I love using them in the shower to listen to music and I don't have to worry about disturbing my family.  So far I like them and I look forward to seeing how they are over time.,4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
One week and they stopped working,"So at first i loved them and after about a week of using them i put them on the charger and they wouldnt charge and the headphones and charging case were extremely hot. There useless now after mutliple times of trying to charge and turn on because they wont charge or turn on. I missed the return window because of being out of town and a busy person.. sucks for me, money down the drain and no headphones.",1.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
"Good value, stays in place.","I was very impressed with these headphones. There are multiple size attachments to ensure you get the best fit, and they stay in place very well, even while at the gym (treadmill tested). The sound quality is incredible and they cancel out other noise.  The only issue I've had so far is with pairing when I take them out of the case. It's infrequent and easily fixed, so it's hardly worth mentioning. Good purchase.",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds

Favorite ear buds to date.,"I run with these daily. I love them! Good sound and a pretty good battery life too.

"So far, so good. Very impressed!","I've only had these headphones for a short while but am very impressed. I was skeptical about true wireless headphones since I have never owned a pair and the reviews on several of other brands' were bad. I was worried about connection issues, poor sound quality, not connecting to my phone, range, etc. However, with these, I have had no issues at all. The sound quality is AMAZING. They have a really good bass and clarity for such small headphones and being in-ear. I also have had no connection issues and they have really good range. So as I understand it, the right connects to the device and the left connects to the right so that they will always play the same if the right has connection to the device, which is really smart in my opinion. I was also skeptical of them falling out or being uncomfortable but I have worn them several times to run/workout and they stay in place and are really comfortable. I would definitely recommend these for anyone who wants a nice pair of true wireless headphones for much less that name brand competitors!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
They fell short on the most important part!,"Using these for the gym or just general purpose. They fit well they sound good and yes they are def water proof I am very happy with these features.

What I am not happy about is the sound is choppy when my iPhone is in my left pocket and my watch is on my left hand. My body is interfering or other near by freqs are over powering it I am not sure witch but it’s very annoying trying to listen To choppy music or audio books. Plus the left one cuts out with the right one.

I have other Bluetooth headphones and they cut out or get choppy now and again but nothing like these. I will keep using them and once I get to my new geographic location if something changes for the better I will update.",2.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great sound for great value!,"I use these regularly for listening to music and videos will at work, through the house. The sound is great, and they fit well - as long as you change the earpieces for your ear size. They also hold a charge for about 3 hours, and recharge very quickly (within 30 minutes). The other thing I really like is the case is the charger - and you can charge it wireless. I have a wireless charger for my Samsung phone and set this on the charger to ensure I have fully charged base every time.
I was skeptical, but very pleased with the purchase. I have had other wireless earphones that I was not so impressed with. This purchase was well worth the money!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
The bass is amazing!,"I love the bass on this earbuds! The moment I put it own, it just made me very happy for the rhythms!!! The sound quality is definitely my favorite compared to the other two pairs of earbuds I bought! But only downside is the fitting in my ears. I have small ears, these earbuds they sticking out and it doesn’t look pretty when I’m wearing them and I afraid it will drop out when I work out! I haven’t try it for work out yet but I hope it is going to be ok because it’s staying in my ears when I was just sitting down in the bus, hope it stays when I work out! And battery lift is a little short it still drains out even I was not using it! But it can last 2-3 days no problem! It also depends how much you use them! If you use them a lot it will only last 2 days! Again I love this earbuds because the sound quality is amazing!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Adequate but not great,"I’ve been waiting for a new company to finish crowdfunding some sweet wireless earbuds, but I got too impatient. I picked these because price and product seemed very similar to multiple products getting great reviews. They aren’t very expensive so I was mainly worried I’d get what I paid for. I’m cautious spending too much on pirated tech since it’s usually inferior. These earbuds are very adequate but are far from being great. They pair first to each other, then they pair to my device. A pleasant voice tells me what’s happening, but to hear it you have to get them in your ears fast. The startup happens when you remove the buds from the charging/storage case. The pairing occurs when I’m putting them in my ears and getting the fit as comfortable as I can. I have a small head with similar ear canals. I’m using the small flanges that fit the ear well, but doesn’t provide a lot of surface to counter balance the weight of the bud. With the battery and tech, they have some weight to them. I went on a 1 1/2 mile walk on a dirt road wearing these. I adjusted each side about three times to shift the weight, find comfort, and once to stop it from rubbing the same spot. They may get more comfortable once I figure out their sweet spot. They do a great job blocking external noises because of the fit. I didn’t hear whistling wind from my brisk walk. The sound is adequate but not high quality. The range just flat out sucks with these. I had a pair of shorts with a cell phone pocket by the right knee pit. I’m not tall so it’s not too far from my ears. I would get no noise from one ear, the other, or both just walking. When I moved the phone to my front hip pocket I was able to get a good connection. I had to do nothing more than move the phone from one spot to the other, the earbuds did all the rest to get me listening again. If I did not have to tether the phone so close to the buds I would like them better. I’m hoping technology improves quickly so that our bodies don’t interfere with the signals, but until it’s affordable and effective, I’ll use these.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Great for the Price,"I dare you to find a comfortable, light wireless earbud for the price.
Was leery at first but I've tried literally most on the market. The expensive ones may have better sound, I mean may have, but lack in other ways. These little guys are light and comfortable, I just wish they were a little bit louder. I work in an industrial atmosphere, some areas louder then others. And it goes without saying, I looked for something different because the expensive one couldn't give the volume levels or comfort either. These ones are close, just wish they were a little bit louder. Guess you have to give up something for comfort.",4.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Tozo T10 - Don't hesitate to buy,"These pair of bluetooth earbuds are great. Pairing is simple and straight forward.  Clarity of sound is amazing. The reviews don't lie. My experience so far has been great. They stay in place through rigorous activities without calling off from the ear, which is a big deal for me as I typically don't have good experience with the ear buds staying in place. Highly recommend and wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair in the future from them!",5.0,Tozo10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds
Good product for the price,"So far I have liked these earbuds, they are comfortable in the ear, I haven't had any issues with them falling out, and the sound quality is good. They cancel outside noise very well. Paired to my phone well and easily.
